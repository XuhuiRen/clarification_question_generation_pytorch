these containers work well . i make then freeze large batches of soup in them all the time . i also use them for large amounts of marinara sauce i freeze . i do n't see why you could n't transfer the contents to a crockpot and then warm up . these are pretty heavy duty containers and can be used over and over again .

my answer is going to be a bit different than what i 've read by others . my intent is not to be controversial but to err on the side of caution . mine sits on a counter top with a space of 10 '' from the top of the oven to the bottom of a kitchen cabinet . either side of the oven has at least 6 '' of space . the bottom sits on the counter top on the units four mounted feet . broiling a steak , chops , etc . is doing it 's job at 500 degrees so if the unit did n't get hot then i doubt it would be doing its job . naturally heat rises and disperses to the top and to each side . these would be areas i would not choose to touch while it 's on for obvious reasons . i 've had mine now for nearly a year without any problems . giving proper attention by allowing the unit to have ventilation above and to each side ; you should n't have any issues with heat .

we called the company with the same question , but got no answer . i do know the new filters take longer to filter the water bc they accumulate air pockets . we were told to tap the sides to dislodge the air bubble , but found it easier to disspell the air by punching small holes in the top screen and then tapping the sides , they still make the best filters for excellent keurig coffee makers . i 'm guessing when i say the reason is probably to use less plactic . i wish they would start a recycling program . like a dollar off your next order for each filter returned , along with free shipping to return them . i also wish there was a way to recycle the coffre cups . from what i 've read , they 've become a landfill blight .

the arm of the sofa has almost broken on us so i would be worried about that with your teenagers . the sofa body itself will be fine . we have n't had to clean it much yet , but we have vacuumed it without any problems and it looks like the covers on the seat cushions are removable if you need to wash them . the pillows and the seat back cushions do not have removable covers .

even though i have not made gelato with my machine , it is my understanding that gelato uses a slow churn process to incorporate very little air into the mixture . this machine churns very slowly . the volume in my ice cream mixes only increases about 10 % or less . so it should work very well for gelato .

i have never owned anything made by shark and never will . ( read on for the reason why . ) however , i ca n't say enough good things about my bissell powerfresh steam mop ! one of the things i take into consideration when buying something like this is the warranty . the bissell powerfresh has a 2 year warranty , which is a year longer than most other ( if not all other ) steam mops on the market . here 's where i was completely turned off by the shark brand of anything . several months ago i was in the market for a new vacuum and was considering a shark . however , i decided against shark after i went to their website and had an on-line chat with a shark customer service representative . i was curious how warranty issued were handled in the event service or repair was needed and the customer service rep told me if a shark product needs repair or service during the warranty period , shark has no local authorized service centers-anywhere . the customer has to ship shark products back to shark for repair and the customer is responsible for shipping costs both ways . thanks , but no thanks shark ! i do n't think it is right for a customer to have to pay for shipping on an item that is still under warranty . i ended up buying 2 bissell vacuums ( 1 for me ; 1 for daughter ) because there is an authorized bissell service center within 5 miles of my home . you can check to see if there is an authorized bissell service center near you by entering your zip code on the bissell website here : http : www.bissell.com service-centers . however , with the bissell powerfresh mop , a service center may not even be necessary . i have heard if the mop fails within the 2 year warranty period , bissell asks you to cut the power cord off your defective mop and mail it to them rather than having you ship the whole mop back . then , once they get the cord , they will ship you a new mop . ( and unlike shark , apparently bissell even sends a pre-paid shipping label . ) i also see a lot of negative comments about shark in the bissell powerfresh steam mop reviews -- reviews from people who have actually owned shark steam mops , say they do n't last very long , and after trying the powerfresh mop , they think it is far superior to shark .

( read on for the reason why . ) however , i ca n't say enough good things about my bissell powerfresh steam mop ! one of the things i take into consideration when buying something like this is the warranty . the bissell powerfresh has a 2 year warranty , which is a year longer than most other ( if not all other ) steam mops on the market . here 's where i was completely turned off by the shark brand of anything . several months ago i was in the market for a new vacuum and was considering a shark . however , i decided against shark after i went to their website and had an on-line chat with a shark customer service representative . i was curious how warranty issued were handled in the event service or repair was needed and the customer service rep told me if a shark product needs repair or service during the warranty period , shark has no local authorized service centers-anywhere . the customer has to ship shark products back to shark for repair and the customer is responsible for shipping costs both ways . thanks , but no thanks shark ! i do n't think it is right for a customer to have to pay for shipping on an item that is still under warranty . i ended up buying 2 bissell vacuums ( 1 for me ; 1 for daughter ) because there is an authorized bissell service center within 5 miles of my home . you can check to see if there is an authorized bissell service center near you by entering your zip code on the bissell website here : http : www.bissell.com service-centers . however , with the bissell powerfresh mop , a service center may not even be necessary . i have heard if the mop fails within the 2 year warranty period , bissell asks you to cut the power cord off your defective mop and mail it to them rather than having you ship the whole mop back . then , once they get the cord , they will ship you a new mop .

it is noisy like a small fan is noisy . not sure why other people say it is quiet , because the heater i bought ( and later returned ) produced noise like a fan . it has a blower within the heater that pushes out the warm air . if you use it at night and you are accustomed to using a fan , the noise might not bother you . but , the orange light is really bright at night . my recommendation is to go to any local store that has a good return policy , buy a similar heater and try it for a few days . then , you can return it if you like .

there is no indication of thread count on the packaging of the sheet set , but my guess would be around 200 thread count when compared to other sheets we own . i will say we are very happy with the sheets . i thought they may be on the cheaper side but they are very soft and comfy . i believe these sets were sold at target and as we have bought other bedding there i would say they are very similar to the circo sheets and quilt sets . no solid answer but i hope this helps . our son is loving his new bedding !

it comes in three pieces . fireplace and basic box frame , then the shelving unit sits on top and gets screwed in , and lastly there are two `` arms '' that pull out of the shelving unit which allow you to screw the corner shelf extension onto it . do your research and be sure you are comfortable with the heat output . i am in the midst of returning ours . it was ineffective in our situation ( finished attic , with poor insulation - our small ceramic tower heater works better ) .

each bottle is 4 '' tall and about 1 1 2 '' in diameter . they are about the size of a standard spice jar that you buy spices in . i do n't have any trouble with them fitting on my cabinet doors with the racks . you do have to place the racks where the bottles wo n't conflict with the shelves in your cabinet . you can adjust the bottles up and down in the clips to avoid the shelves .

this vacuum takes electrolux 's s-bag . my jetmaxx came with 13 bags included , but that probably varies . they come in different grades ... fineness of filtration , etc . there are also knock-offs that are less expensive , offered on amazon by envirocare , etc . it looks like the knock-offs are not allowed to say `` s-bag '' so they might say electrolux `` style s '' or i think style ox might be the same thing . check with the bag supplier .

personally , i find any lights obtrusive in the bedroom . i have installed this unit in a high school nurse 's office but do remember several lights that i do n't think can be turned off . but it is a good unit - very capable . i would recommend making a couple of flaps out of card stock and fasten them to the unit with electrical tape as a hinge . the card stock can be lowered over the leds at night and lifted when you wish .

amazon does sell adjustable frames that say they are good for memory foam mattresses so i would think that this one could be used for it . if you already have a bed frame , what you should know is that these types of mattresses need to be on a very sturdy surface , not like a regular box spring or the warranty would be void . the reasons for this is that if they are not on a stable surface , they will not perform properly . my fiance built a wooden frame for our first memory foam mattress and did n't buy the correct type of wood for it . we 're not small people and the wood cracked a bit and we both noticed immediately that the mattress seemed to become spongy . he fixed the break in the frame and it immediately became sturdy again . do a search on adjustable bed frames for memory foam mattresses on amazon and see if yours looks like the ones amazon sells to see if it will work for you .

well , that 's a good question . since my husband tossed all packaging right into the recycle bin , including any paperwork that may have been in the box , i did n't even think about that . really , if i 'd had the packaging , i would have made an effort to return the set , or go to henckels and see about a warranty . since we did n't think ahead , we 're just stuck with them . knives are getting worse , btw . more rust , and edges are quite dull - we are back to using our 20 year old chicago cutlery set .

its very small- similar to what convenience stores use for their hot dog condiments . i use it for the same thing- about a cup and a half to two cups of diced onions fits in one compartment . i put onions , tomatoes , shredded lettuce , and pickles or banana peppers in each when i do a party with sub sandwiches ( a six foot sandwich from walmart is about $ 32 and feeds a big party ) . its the cheapest way i 've found to feed a lot of people decent quality food and this little gadget is perfect for all the condiments !

i have n't tried it but yes , you just have to leave enough space between the mattress and the wall to allow the part that will become the back rest to lean back and stay up . also , the seat will be pretty low to the ground . right now i have all three sections folded against the walls with two standard pillows as a backrest , i love it !

i really do n't know . how well it sleeps on its own because i bought it to `` soften '' up a very firm mattress . but i do think you could roll it up and take it on a camping trip . when it is delivered , it is compressed down for shipping . once it is opened and expands to size it should be easy to roll , just might be bulkier at full size ... .

we would use the normal bands you get in the store . just dry them after washing . we put ours through the dishwasher and they do not rust . maybe the water in your area has minerals that cause oxidation in which case hand washing and drying would be important .

hi , the voltage is 110 so i would n't buy it . i am pretty sure you can find excellent juicer in germany or elsewhere in europe . you could use a transformer but it might damage the motor after a while and if anything happens while it 's guaranteed , it will be such a pain to return the product . and you will most likely pay taxes when the juicer arrives in germany which could be expensive . i am french and have lived in different countries in europe and i ordered once something in usa and the taxes were so expensive . anyway , this is just an advice .

these knives require periodic sharpening . i do n't know your kitchen habits as compared to mine , so what works for me may not work for you . but here are my thoughts on chicago cutlery vivid knives ... they sharpen easily ( i use a smith diamond encrusted sharpener with coarse and fine grits . i do n't have to use it very often . ) and they 're easy to keep sharp with a sharpening steel . these are easy to care for ... use a steel and sharpener regularly and you wo n't have a problem keeping them sharp . after several months of use i do n't see any chipping of the color coating . and i prefer these knives to a couple of low end j a henckels that i have .

i bought the king size for my bed . only problem is it 's not long enough on the sides and the cord should be longer for the dual controls . when i make the bed , the control falls off the night table . it 's excellent for warmth though .

i never tried ... . i use plain tap water and add a small amount of vinegar and a few drops of essential oil ( peppermint , or eucalyptus or tea tree ) . i have linoleum floors . my two labs constantly have dirty or muddy feet so use it all the time . i keep the reservior full of the mix and use as needed . sometimes it uses it all up and sometimes just a spot job works so i left the solution in it . i do clean dirty water after each use . i am not sure if you could leave bleach water in it but if you dilute it still would give extra cleaning but would empty after each use . if you do try leave a reply back so i know how it works .

the steamer part is pretty easy to use in my opinion . fill the compartment with water , set the vacuum on the pad and turn the dial to steam . i have tile flies and have not noticed streaking . the vacuum container does need cleaned after each use because it 's pretty small and really affects the suction if full . works great for my kitchen to vacuum and steam . not for the whole house and lots of carpet .

i put the bed together by myself in about 4 hours . it was n't very difficult and would be quicker with 2 people . the box was bulky and probably 80 pounds . i needed my husband 's help to carry it inside . i ended up taking parts out of the box and moving them to the room i was assembling in .

i no longer have the packaging but i 'm almost certain the dimensions are 108x98 . i have a standard king which is wider but shorter than a california king . california kings are longer but not as wide . also , i have a high bed with a thick pillow top mattress . the spread drapes beautifully from top to the floor . i do n't have pillow shams but the size is substantial enough that i make my bed like my grandmother did before shams . unless you have an abnormally sized bed , it will be more than enough without the need for a bed skirt . i will never go back to comforter sets . i bought a chenille spread at xmas and paid a considerable amount more and it does n't come close to the quality of this one . its weighty not what you would expect for the price . its vintage quality without the vintage price tag . i will definitely purchase more as i like to change my decor often . i do n't think you will be disappointed . i hope this helps !

hi . i had the same issue with smell . i did not run the machine right away . i took it out and cleaned the filter in lysol and let it sit for about 30 mins . then rinsed really well and put it back after it dried completely . there was a slight smell for a few days , but it has gone away . you may want to put it outside or wipe down with baking soda and water just to help get rid of the smell .

it has no power to the head you can only use turbo brush which does pretty good light duty job for area rugs for me . what i really do not like about this vac is that control buttons are very soft and i always hit them while carrying the vac against my knee and turn it off or rewind the cord or reduce power . since i do not drag the vac behind me but rather carry it in my arm wile vacuuming i do it every few minutes and it is very irritating otherwise it is a good vac

i used keurig in the office for a couple of years and the coffee is ok. i 've had a nespresso at home for 2 years and i prefer the taste of nespresso to keurig . but they both have quite a variety of flavors and you might find one you prefer over the other . you can also buy keurig almost anywhere , even at the hardware store . nespresso you have to order directly from them and have it delivered .

not sure what normal smarties are . i looked it up and discovered what you meant . this would be perfect for m & ms and smarties . when dispensing m & ms , because they are somewhat polished , just hold your hand around the container you 're dispensing to to avoid the candies bouncing around or it may not even do that . i use it for dispensing cereal . i hope this helps .

you get 2 rails , 4 legs . have the legs at 7 but there is at least another 2 to unscrew and there are 4.5 inch extensions so -- you can go at least to the 14 inch range . think the width will go to 75 but ... they 're on the bed at this time so we ca n't measure for you .

yes - i have it arranged the opposite way . a day or so before you setup , do a full inspection of all of the pieces - it will be time consuming , but will give you time to request replacements . two of the very large pieces on mine were cracked ( one is on the top surface ) . it really takes away from the value of this desk , but not much you can do once in the heat of putting the monster together . it would be very difficult to take apart to replace , if you waited for them to send a replacement .

i have made the single cup size batches many times with perfect results . ( the mininum size is 1 2 cup as marked on the cooking bowl . ) when i made larger batches , there was no noticable difference in the results . always perfect ! as long as the measuring of rice and water is accurate , i see no reason why the cooker would not cook as little as 1 2 cup at a time .

yes - it 's a two part mold and is fantastic . it 's really easy to make the skull either as put together both filled parts for a solid one piece or if you coat in layers you can make the skull hollow . hope that helps if you want a picture ( not brilliant resolution ) but you 're welcome i can send one .

it is the same rust-resistant matte black finish on the entire pot . we 've had this for almost a year now and really like it . it 's held up well . we keep it on our propane heating stove ( like a woodstove ) with water in it and i 've never seen it steam but it does but a little more moisture in the air . just a bit of advice -- i would definitely season it with some kind of oil when you first get it ... we used organic coconut oil all over inside and out and `` baked '' it in the kitchen oven on 350 for an hour , and that has made all the difference for maintaining the finish and avoiding rust , etc .

this is not a heater that that can be carried in and simply hooked to batteries and off you go . mounting requires drilling holes , wiring requires you to open battery compartment , remove nuts on battery connections , and then rewiring with new terminals .

how does goat cheese compare to the consistency of butter or soft cream cheese ? i have used it on soft cream cheese , not the whipped variety , the kind in a brick . it does work spreading out a layer of cream cheese ... it has some limited success on spreading creamy peanut butter.. but it works for that too . i 've had this or different versions of this product for years and i swear by it .

if it is error 3 and the picture of the arrows going in a circle , i have been successful by : 1 ) remove the edge brushes and check for coiled up hair 2 ) remove the main beater brush and pull off end caps ; check for hair debris 3 ) when replacing main brush , carefully inspect the groove shape on the squared end of the brush end cap . it should drop in easily ; you should not have to force it . if you have to push it in , then it is not correctly aligned . hope this helps .

the short answer is absolutely . there is plenty of room . it is a 90 oz container . here is the warning : the 5th side of the container creates some kind of vortex that mixes the product very thoroughly . this mixing require a tremendous amount of extra energy , especially when at or near capacity . luckily , vita-mix is incredibly over designed , and can support these overloads for several minutes without doing long term damage . i have no problem processing 64 oz of diced tomatoes for 20 - 40 seconds . so an emphatic yes . just use good judgment , and if the motor is straining , shut 'er down .

you can use the following formula to calculate how much it will cost to operate a 1,500-watt space heater ( or any other electric equipment ) : watts x hours of use 1,000 x cost per kilowatt-hour = cost of operation this means that if a 1,500-watt heater ran 24-hours at a rate of 7.57 cents a kilowatt-hour , the cost would be $ 2.73 a day ( 1,500 x 24 1,000 x $ 0.0757 ) . for a month that would amount to $ 81.76 added to the electric bill of the average customer . source : conservingelectricity.com

do n't know country of origin but as a damascus blade , perhaps , japan . it is very similar with the shun 8 inch chef knife , which i also own . it 's slightly shorter than a shun and lighter . the blade is sharp ; remember to hone blade edge prior to cutting . i wanted to try a chef knife approx 40 % less than a shun . for the price wonderful knife . also try a zhen vg-10 or 3-ply knives .

yes , it will take any edge pro compatible stone . if your knives are in decent condition and you just want to bring them back from ok to real sharp then the included stones will suffice . if you intend to do anything more intense than that you should pick up some additional stones sooner rather than later . google around and you will find lots of alternative sources for stones for edge pro .

michelle , the pillow actually changes in density or loft . if someone prefers only minimal support they use the lower recommended amount of water to fill the inner pouch . if they prefer a bit more support , as did i , they would use more water . the more water , the firmer the pillow gets and this added volume of water gives it a bit more loft or height . picture a zip-lock baggie : with no or little water it will be flat . with water added it will fill the bag and be `` higher '' . the interesting thing is that the pillow conforms to your head and neck . if someone is petite and with a normal build the less firm filling range may be enough . if someone is larger or has broader shoulders or requires a bit more support they just add a bit more water . the pillow cradles the neck . i love it . and still no pain !

not certain what you mean by `` customize '' but on my food saver machine i have 2 buttons - one button is a heat and the other button is for the vacuum function -- what you do is cut off a bit over what you want the bag size to be - say if you want a 12 inch long bag i would cut it at about 13 inches - you use only the heat button to seal one end of the cut off section and then you place the item you want to vacuum seal inside the bag you have just created then you put the other end ( still open ) in the machine and hit the vacuum button - this will vacuum out the air and then the heat button will seal the edge . after a bit of use i can just `` eye '' how much i need for the product i want to vacuum seal in the product .

arlenette , i do n't know if they are made of real turkish cotton , but if you 're asking if the material is absorbent ( as the wonderful old dish towels made of turkish cotton , that used to be available , were ) , the answer is yes . these towels are very nicely absorbent , much as the old turkish cotton dish towels used to be , before synthetic dishtowels became the norm .

marilyn , sorry i ca n't answer as i bought the shelf for my daugher in law in california and left it there . i think it is about 8 inches wide deep if i remember correctly . it is just a heavy wire structure that makes a division on an existing shelf . i do remember that it was n't as deep or tall as i had hoped , so a little disappointed but it did the trick of dividing the space for storage .

i got the nuwave and the cast iron grill top to grill steaks in the winter when it is too dark and cold to grill outside . i love it ! make sure the grill is very hot before putting the steak on ( a matter of seconds as it heats up really fast ) . that will get you great grill-stripes and the steak wo n't stick . clean up is easy if you wipe the cast iron clean while it is still warm .

i think it was relatively low relative to others like this . i purchased this for the same purpose , to use in a car on a cross-country road trip . i think peak was like 600 watts ? more than enough for my 1200 interter . however , be warned , that this thing takes almost 30 minutes to boil your water . i tried it once , plugged directly into the ac outlet . returned it right away after that first use .

first of all : you do not want a lot of ozone production . ozone ( at best ) is a respiratory irritant and can have serious health effects if exposure and `` dose '' are long and heavy . second , i too found that , even after a few months - there was little build up on any part of the filtration system in this unit . it is not on the consumers report list of approved air purifiers , either . at least - i looked and could n't find it . i have a little larger honeywell unit which absolutely has a higher rate of air volume . but its filters do n't show much build up either . - the dust build up is more noticeable on the honeywell unit than the mountain air unit after about six months though . i 've taken to running both together in a bedroom just on the idea of applying some `` overkill '' because both units are rated for larger floor area . the ozone output i keep at about 25 % of max and sometimes i turn it off completely .

we have the same issue , except the clock is more erratic so there 's no way to set the timer and know when it will start the coffee . i 've given up using the clock & timer on it . the clock is too hard to read anyway since there 's no light . i 've complained to b & d 's customer service , they wo n't do anything for us , so i 'll just live with it until it 's time for a new one and will not buy another black & decker .

my recollection is that you can splash water on it without too much of a problem ( hard to avoid when filling for use ) but they did not indicate it was submersible . i have had many pots by this maker over the years and i would never place the lower pat of the pot under water . i have inadvertently placed it in the sink with water running around its base as i filled it without a problem , but i have always taken care not to submerge it in any fashion . to clean the chrome exterior i turn it upside down so water drains away from the heating element section and then wipe dry before uprighting .

this does not have the convection oven feature . i , too , was a little confused about this , but decided to order it anyway . i am glad we did because , hands down , this is the best toaster oven we have ever owned ( i ca n't believe i am excited about this- it really is true , you do eventually turn into your parents ) . very spacious , cooks and toasts evenly , and the crumb tray covers the entire bottom so it is very easy to clean . we have had it now for about 6 months . i would buy it again in a second .

the reason to buy this fan is that it puts out a nice breeze and is very quiet . i purchased multiple of them for my house because they serve this purpose well . i would not purchase it for noise while sleeping -- if you are looking for noise , i would go with a product line that is not marketed as being quiet . this fan actually is quiet .

i agree with 2 or 3 inches more . you have to measure the top of the cake you want to cover plus twice for the sides . so for example , let 's say you had a cake that is 8 inches in width and 4 inches in height . you would add 8 + 4 + 4 = 16. but then add 2 more inches for a total of 18 inches of rolled out fondant . as for using the mat to apply the fondant ; after you roll out your fondant on the mat to the desired size , gently roll the mat up from one end to the other into a tube shape . then put your fingers in each end of the mat tube and starting on one side of your cake , start unrolling the mat and draping the fondant across to the other side . i hope i explained that well enough ... lol also , if you are new to fondant , i would advise you to avoid the wilton brand fondant as it is not very friendly nor is it remotely tasty . i personally like fondarific and satin ice , both of which are available here on amazon . hope this helped ! : )

overall , it 's great . i would recommend that you have have your electrician put it on a wall switch timer and just leave the switch that 's on the rack in the on position all the time . this way you wo n't ever worry about remembering to turn it off .

hmm , i 'm not sure since i never bother to turn the brush off even on laminate and tile floors .

lol ... been asked so many questions about this pillow , and yours would seem so easy , but it 's actually hardest . do n't have proper scale for an exact weight . so , after comparisons i made , i will say about 4 pounds ... .dense 4 pounds , though . do n't think that its hard on your head though . i stand by every word i said in my review months ago . use it every night and it is still in perfect condition . i wish i could be of more help . i have never had a better , more comfortable pillow , in my life . good luck !

i 'm not sure , but the replacement costs approx $ 10 and the whole french press costs approx $ 15- $ 17 , so you could either just buy the replacement and if it did n't work you could buy the whole unit and have an extra replacement . i also think the sizes are rather similar between brands . hope this helps ...

steam has a temperature of 212f ( 100c ) at sea level and normal atmospheric pressure . since this steam is not pressurized or contained ( it is escaping from the nozzle ) this will be the temperature . however , steam has more heat energy , since it takes another 540 cal gc to change the water to steam . this is why it hurts more to burn yourself on steam more than water .

what i received were mini cookie cutters only about 1.5 '' across and are of ok quality . the cutters that i received are the characters c-3po , yoda , vader and chewie . this was not what was pictured when i ordered the cutters . a stormtrooper and boba fett were suppose to be part of the set . what i received was a cheap copy of williams-sonoma cutters . these will work with the right cookie dough , if you want micro cookies . i would suggest buying the real williams-sonoma cutters , which is what i thought i was buying .

i have to strongly dissuade you . i was forced to return my set with such lowered expectations that i am no longer considering reed & barton . i opened the first piece and there was a ugly swirling scratch across the bowl of the iced teaspoon . i opened a second piece -- a regular teaspoon -- and the end and one side of the bowl were sharp enough that i believe i could have cut my finger , let alone mouth , on it . most dinner knives are less sharp . obviously unacceptable and i returned . the seller was lovely about the return however . as far as your actual question -- the pieces are stated to be 18 10 -- however given the overall quality of these and other made in china products you would have to ask yourself the level of trust you place in the labeling .

i 'm not sure , but the roller they send is not any good , its more of a slider . the cabinets i painted were small and a brush worked just fine for me as well as enhanced the wood grain beneath . it did seem pretty thin and may work well thru a commercial sprayer . the coverage is very good . good luck .

hello michael . sorry for the delay getting back to you . the vented compost bucket actually has a double seal around all edges both on the interior and exterior . also the compost bucket is vented with a activated charcoal filter mounted to the lid interior covering the vented holes . the vents allow the moisture and heat that comes from the food as it sits in the container to vent first through the charcoal filter ( absorbing odors ) then through the vents on the lid . they both work fantastic together to keep moisture to a minimum in the bucket , and also minimize odors from coming into your kitchen .

i have not had my mattress pad long enough for it to need washing . some things i wash before i use them , but this was sealed and would be covered by a sheet and i did not wash it . however , the description said it was machine washable & dry . it is soft and comfortable , but one comment by a customer said that it had helped her backache . it is not really thick enough to make a difference , if i had a backache . but is a good buy for the money and i am happy with it . it is also very easy to put on the mattress . some pads have to be pulled and stretched to get them on . this one does not .

it comes in a rectangular , tall box all rolled up in a flattened condition . after i removed the heavy item from the box , i spent time rolling it over and over to remove the large amount of shrink wrap except for the last layer of the plastic . at this point , the mattress is still in a flattened condition . it 's no longer rolled up , but with the normal length and width of a mattress . it takes maybe half an hour for the mattress to expand in height to a normal size .

i do n't think that they include any . it 's pretty simple . you place the mattress on the surface that you want it to end up on , take the plastic wrap off and it unfolds and plumps up .

i am using my chairs inside and are the gunmetal finish . just from the look of them i think they would rust outdoors but i do not know this for fact . i do have factory painted bistro chairs outdoors all year around and they definitely have a different finish than the my amelia metal caf chairs . maybe you can research a clear coat you can do yourself . i am very pleased with my chairs , they look great and the price was excellent . sorry i could n't give you a definite answer .

i suspect it might not go to the edges all the way around . it goes to the edges on my standard bed with lots of non fluff material to tuck under . that material is elastic and fits very nicely . so if you do n't mind some of it not being covered it might work for you . i 've washed mine 2 x now and it has done very well , just like new .

i 'm using a regular , inexpensive twin mattress , so i ca n't be sure . but , for what it 's worth , here 's my advice . i would think , if your foam mattress is a good quality fairly dense , and at least 6 '' high , then it would be fine . you may also want to consider the weight of potential users . if you 're planning on having young children use it occasionally , then you can get by with something of lesser quality . they seem to be able to sleep anywhere . if it 's to be used by teens or adults , then they would appreciate better quality . so , i guess you just have to decide who 's going to be using it and how long you 'd like them to stay !

the rack is made to fit a standard 80 '' tall door which is typical in most entry doors . it comes in several pieces which is basically an over the door hook that attaches a bracket to hold the shelves baskets . there are three brackets total and finally attach a final bracket that goes under the door . you can opt to use included screws to stabilize the shelves which i recommend and then you can easily mount the shelves however you want to space them apart . the highest you can mount the top shelf is 8 '' from the top and the lowest is 2 '' from the bottom . if your door is shorter than 80 '' you can remove the bottom bracket or one of the three brackets to shorten it . hope this helps .

if you want small round disks , you jab the carrot standing up into the pins of the handle . a long carrot is too unstable and will flip off . so you have to cut the carrot into maybe a 2 '' -3 '' piece , jab it on standing up and try to cut it . it 's easier at a bit of an angle . if you want long strips , jab the carrot on sideways and drag the length of the carrot across the blade . and if you are talking baby carrots forget it . i 've tried . honestly , a food processor with a feed tube is the best way to go to quickly slice carrots .

the outside of your shoe is leather , but is the lining leather or vinyl . if the lining is vinyl it may have gone back to original shape . are you using a stretching spray , which is probably mostly alcohol . try again , with a spray , leave in a bit longer . some other consumers say 5 days . my shoes are all itslian leather lined , sorry , they stay stretched . i count the number of twists i do on a shoe . if you have to repeat process , give another twist or so . good luck .

i have one and it needs another back up battery if you want to use it longer than the regular twenty minutes it seems to last in one vacuuming use . it just shuts off at a certain point . i know it says it needs only 4 hours to charge , but when you read the instructions it says 4-7 hours . it took a full 7 hours for ours to charge . i am taking this vacuum back this friday on my day off from work . it also does not come with a hose or attachments . so the dust will most likely pile up and be very visible along the floor next to the wall and in the corners unless you buy a separate little device like a dust buster . then where 's the point in buying this little vacuum when additional money needs to be spent . like i said an additional battery needs to be purchased which is what jc penny would have rather me do then have me return it , except they only told me about the need for an additional battery when i called to see if it can be returned . the type of battery it runs on as mentioned is a nickel metal hydride battery . they do give information on how to empty the container when it is full after vacuuming . emptying it is very easy compared to my old hoover vacuum . that 's not enough for me though . i have read similar complaints about the run time of this vacuum online as well , but unfortunately i did not look those up until after i bought the machine .

possibly but it depends on the things you are going to put on the shovels and how careful you will be . remember , this is intended for books and not muddy boots or hard metal things like ice skates . i have had one in my living room for several years with lots of books on it . it is just as good as when i put it there . the new white one is in my kitchen and it stores things such as kitchen appliances , some cooking pans , etc . on that one i lined with kitchen contact paper so i could replace it if the surface would become too soiled . the unit works perfectly for me for that use . in the garage i have steel shelving where everything gets thrown on . i think you understand . bottom line - it is a great unit ( one of the best ) in all regards . if i need another shelving unite in the house i would buy this one without even considering something else . however if i need another unit for the garage , i would buy a steel rack . home that helps you , bear

i do n't think i will answer your question , but might give you some help in determining which one fits you . this is only 15 inches tall and therein lies part of the answer you want . this will handle maybe the size of your living room . ( depending on how big of a place you have of course ) in the other guy 's full report on it , he stated that he bought two . changing the subject , i went to oreck and typed in the model # and came up with nada . he also stated that he has problems in getting filters for it , other than ordering it via a phone . so that might be two strikes against it already . i did n't happen to see what fs means to oreck . some places it means that the full warranty will apply . others it means that only 90 days . i think i 've decided that if i 'm going to spend over 100 bucks , i 'm going to get a little bigger unit and one that will handle a large area . hope this helps..ta ta

do you mean is it machine washable ? i have no idea , but i would not hesitate to do so . i have a shower brush , which is actually an old dish brush , which i take into the shower with me to scrub the mat when it needs it . but i would machine wash it with cold water at a delicate setting without fear !

yes it will , but 8 ' is the max . i have 9 ' ceilings and i had to use the option to purchase extensions from the company . then the provided curtain ( which surprisingly was n't bad looking at all ) was too short . no worries though any drapery will work . i love it and you do n't need any tools for assembly or installation . the floor to ceiling poles are spring loaded and may depress more after loaded with clothes , so make sure it 's tight to the ceiling floor to start . i have mine over loaded with clothing and it 's sturdy . i was a great purchase . it 's better than i expected for the price . hope this helps .

it depends on the finish on your hardwood floors . we have a coat of polyurathane on ours that is quite old with bits of the real wood exposed . the steam mop did n't work on our floors because it `` lifted '' more of the polyurathane off the floors . i was not real pleased with this `` newer '' version of the smart living mop . it does n't work as well as the old one i had and i was unable to return it to the company . i 'm stuck with it and will make the best of it but would n't recommend it . good luck .

i do believe that they are the same . 1.3 h.p . dc motor which is i understand it uses a gear drive mechanism . believe it or not the next step up is a hobart 5 qt . mixer with a 1 3 h.p motor . i am not sure why the motors are rated like this . last i knew the hobart used bely drive and still has to be turned off to switch gears of which there are only three . it will however low through just about anything without complaint all day every day . bagel dough is one of the hardest doughs on a mixer . i would n't recommend using this as the primary mixer in a bagel shop , but other than that the hobart 5 qt . is a classic beast of a machine and you will find that the 3 speeds are all you really knead : ) the only issue is the cost . you can buy 3 kitchen aid mixers for the price of one hobart 5-quart . so i guess it would all depend on what you do with the mixer and how often you do it . hobart mixers go up in size to the point where you could fit a person in the mixing bowl . even though the kitchen aid says it is `` commercial '' it is n't really when put up against the same size of hobart mixer ( same manufacturer , hobart corp makes kitchen aid ) . so decide on how much money you want to spend and get the hobart if you can do so without putting to much strain on your pocket , you will not be sorry . i have used them in commercial kitchens for 30+ years and they are the standard by which all other mixers are measured . although other manufacturers make soma great mixers to be sure , it is my opinion that there is nothing like a hobart mixer for function and day in and day out durability . hobart 's are also easy to get parts for and fix if some does ever go wrong . you can also look into used refurbished hobart 's without much worry as to their ability as long as they are bought by a certified hobart reseller or someone you trust and who knows the history of the machine . best of luck and happy mixing ...
