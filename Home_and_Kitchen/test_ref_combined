what is the warranty ? 
is the tap flap have a spring that makes it automatically close when not holding it open or can you remove it from the juicer ?

i just got my flex brew , read the booklet and directions . did exactly what the instructions said but the water does not come out in to the carafe.why ? 
does this product accept k cups or not ? i keep getting different answers . love the concept of this machine , but need it to also accept k cups as an alternative . thanks 
can i choose the temperature level as some other products ? 
i 'm aware that paper filters are not needed on the single serve side however , i would like to use them for convenience . anyone know which work best ?
