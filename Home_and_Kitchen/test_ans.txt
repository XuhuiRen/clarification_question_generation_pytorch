your best bet is to contact the vendor directly . asking that question here poses it to those that have no control over changing your date of receipt . if it 's shipping from china , prepare to wait 4 - 6 weeks , and you still may not get it , as has happened to me with multiple orders for a variety of items . good luck !

the tops may be tight enough for that . i always freeze them standing up in a tall glass , so i 'm not sure if they would leak . leave at least an inch at the top and kind of let the air out and they seal . yes , you eat them by squeezing and slurping . fyi ... they contain more than a regular popsicle , not quite twice as much , so they 're a pretty big serving .

i do n't really know , but i do n't think i would chance it either . it is too bad that it is not made in a smaller size or varying sizes do to all different companies making there own varying sizes . i guess if it did not fit my pan snuggly then i would save it for one of them that it does , and would probably use parchment paper . it is just too bad that bakewear ca n't be made to be indistructable . oh well what is a person to do .

i have n't tried but i 'm wondering when you say gelatin pop , are you not planning on freezing it solid ? i think you 'd have a hard time extracting them with the pop not getting messed up other the stick coming out . the molds are can be a little stiff when cold . never a problem for a solid pop but could be with a gelatin pop .

ratchet bolts would be the best . customers would have to supply the socket set to install . but at least the bolts would n't get stripped out like the ones used now or get their hands tore up ? a couple of the bolts i installed i do n't know if i will ever be able to get them out without cutting them off if i ever had too ? but other wise we love the product ! it 's was easy to put together . the directions are easy to follow ! i got it put together in less than an hour ! the wall mount took longer than it should because of the bolts it comes with . i hope this helps .

the mixture does mix well . the noise level is about a 5 or so ( no louder than our old sunbeam . the only complaint i have is that if you are using the plastic `` guard cover '' it is very difiucult to add additional ingredients with the mixer running . so i just cut it off and raise the guard and add them . if you decide that you want the smaller mixing bowl for this unit be sure and check with the oster people for the new bowl . i understand the small bowl will not fit the new model .

i used my cricut to cut out letters . i painted the board i used white , cut out the letters in vinyl , and then painted over the letters in a darker color , then removed the vinyl to reveal white lettering on the board i used . these worked perfectly , although i would recommend using a smooth board like mdf rather than plywood or a canvas ( the paint will tend to bleed through and then you will need to touch up the letters ) .

i have not used glue paste in molds so i ca n't help there but ... i take paper that my art students no longer want and recycle the paper by ripping it in pieces putting it in a blender with water and blending it to make paper pulp . we then put in in a mold and press out the water using a piece of screen . let it dry in the mold and pop out . now you have a paper piece that can be painted or collage into other art .

on carpet it is a little noisier than my last vaccuum ( which was n't a hoover ) but it is n't terrible . the vaccuum works so incredibly well that i 'm ok with the noise , but again it is n't substantially noisier than any other vaccuum i have used . the one situation where this vaccuum is very noisy , is when you vaccuum bare floor with the rollers . if you click off the rollers ( with a simple foot press ) and use suction only on the bare floor , that makes the noise drop significantly . i use suction only on my bare floors and it picks up everything . hope this helps .

yes it does . i have smaller water bottles in it right now ( 8 oz ) and just tried an 8 oz coke bottle - i stack these lengthwise , however , and it holds up to 24 of the 8 oz bottles . it also holds the larger water and soda bottles , but i stack those width-wise , which is what i usually use . what i like best about this bin is that the bottles are neatly stacked and , of course , are never toppling over as before when i tried to stand them on the refrigerator shelves . i am considering getting another one for my v8 juice .

i guess i 'm not sure what the question is . what has probably happened , and amazon is doing this with increasing frequency , is that the someone purchased this fan , found it to be defective and returned it . it should work with the adaptor . if it does n't it is defective . also , we tried two sets of 6 of these fans over two years for our outdoor art shows and they move almost no air . i gave the first set away and returned the second set .

i had no problem with noise from the unit . even slept with it in a small bedroom and was surprised i did n't notice it after a short while . it is rated for 800 square ft. which meant i had to move it around until the problem resolved , but that was my fault for not paying attention to the details . otherwise very pleased with the product . hope this helps .

i would think that if you had it in a bedroom , the noise might keep you up and the heat it generated would make it uncomfortable especially if it blew on your bed . i suggest you put it in an adjacent room , maybe a bathroom , and it will will not be a problem . plus you can easily place the drain hose for the water into the toilet tank.that is what i did .

unfortunately i do n't know . i have never used essential oils and do n't know how difficult ( if at all ) they are to humidify . it 's a great humidifier on it 's own though . if oils like that are typically okay to put into humidifiers then i would guess it 's okay .

i do n't know . it 's sort of a thin formica-like veneer over some sort of pressed wood , i 'd imagine . the boards that form the sides , top , bottom and shelves are fairly thick and heavy . very heavy . the 'beadboard ' piece that forms the back is very thin , comes folded -- it looks nice but is not what i 'd call 'wood . ' that said i am very happy with these pieces . i ended up buying 14 of them to do a total makeover in my basement craft room and office and it 's been a year now ; they are perfect for my needs and very roomy and sturdy . whatever they may be made of .

it was a little loud if in the same room with a tv . sort of like white noise . i had major problems with leaking . the auto shut off when fill never worked so when full it flooded . also it clogged often and flooded the floor . it worked well when running . if you drain into a sink with a hose , you will love it . i had to empty the bucket and i finally gave up and got another brand after so many floods was damaging my wall .

i think a 5 inch would be suitable for a daybed , as typically a daybed is for a child ( or someone weighing less than an adult ) or for guests . we have a 10 inch for our bed ( 2 adults ) and i would not have chosen any less for adults to sleep on every night .

i do n't think it would be too much of a problem but we were pretty careful about putting it in an extra room on the floor spread out and leaving the window open to let it air out and expand as much as physically possible . we gave it a few days to make sure it was good to go . if you do n't have enough room to do that , then i would continue flipping it on each side upright so that it does n't unevenly expand .

rubber wood is a strong type of wood ( that i understand to be pretty environmentally friendly ) . the white color is paint , i believe . not sure what you mean by what kind . i do n't know the exact seat arm rest measurements but they are probably available on their own website ... ? by the way , they did n't sell their own cushions when i received my chair , so i do n't know how theirs are ( the ones i purchased are ok , but probably not as perfect of a fit ) . i really like ours -- seems to be of really good quality . hope this helps some .

hi laurel ... not sure if you needed inside or outside dimensions , so i 'll give you both : i just measured mine : the outside is approximately 17 1 4 '' wide , 10 '' high , and 11 '' deep . the inside is approximately 11 '' wide , 6 3 4 '' high from the base ( 6 1 2 '' from the turntable ) , and 10 1 2 '' deep . i noticed these measurements differ slightly from those listed in the description . it 's compact , but takes a dinner plate with no problem . hope that helps .

i have n't used a glass container yet but the plastic containers do get pretty hot so i would n't suggest it for children unless heated for less than 1 hour . after 1 hour the food lets off steam so it could be dangerous for children . hope this helps !

filter works good . just have to make sure that you run the water thru the filter for 10 minutes initially not the 5 minutes stated in the packaging . when you buy a replacement filter it states 10 minutes . it does make a big difference .

hi bobby ! thanks for the question . my eco mattress bag is designed to protect your mattress from bed bug , mite , fleas , ticks and moth infestation . since they can not penetrate me eco mattress bag , as it 's designed as a non-vented 2.2 professional grade recycled plastic ( this is a huge factor ) , bed bugs and other small insects can not enter , break , chew through , burrow or nest like other mattress bags . other mattress bags are usually made with small venting holes which allow bed bugs easy access- which defeats the purpose of protection . our eco mattress bag is also made 15 % bigger so you can pull and seal tight to prevent any bed bugs from entering your mattress . for full protection , i would also suggest to wrap your box spring as bed bugs are commonly found infesting and reproducing in this area . i hope this is helpful and please let me know if you need anymore help ! sincerely green , spencer brown founder and inventor of the eco mattress bag

im not sure how tall your keurig reservoir is but i have my unit next to my sink with the spout hanging over the edge . this affords me enough room to fill just about anything and any water that isnt caught in what im filling simply drops into the sink.. but over a counter i would estimate the spout is about 7 to 8 inches above the countertop .

i do not know about either of these as i do not have acrylic and have not removed . the adhesive is separate and i would image that if you were concerned you could probably find a known safe bet at home depot . also , the adhesive does not smell like it would be the type that would eat into acrylic . the step is very good , however .

first of all , let me tell you we did not keep this unit-it produced too much ozone for us and it was really noisy . we already had a living air classic xl15 and we decided since we liked it so much and it did such a good job , we would have it repaired . the unit is 8 '' wide x 11.75 '' high x 9.75 '' deep . i do know that the filter on our unit is washable . hope this helps .

i would say no , while the tempered glass may be fine the oven would melt the hard plastic handle . in addition the lids are vented so it would not trap the great like a traditional oven lid . i would n't do it . the pan has the same handle so i would n't put it in the oven either .

i use the grill almost every day if not twice a day . it 's one of the few grills without teflon which i 've heard can cause cancer . i like the fact that the fat drips below without getting back on the food . i ca n't digest any type of oil or fat so it 's essential for me to have this type of grill if i 'm to cook something . i 'm very happy with the grill . it took me long enough to find it , and i 'm glad that amazon had it .

if you are trying to froth milk for coffee you can choose either to heat it or not . for heating the time to completion obviously varies depending on how warm the milk is at the beginning and how much milk there is in the frother . it would take less time if you did not want to heat it but either way it is less than a minute . not sure about the 12 oz part . we just make enough to cover top of coffee

the sensor is in the `` head '' . what is great is that it 's looking down , not forward . i read reviews of other pumps that are so sensitive that you walk by and they get activated . not this one , as this is `` looking '' down and it only dispenses soap when you want it to . i had it for eight months , and love it .

it 's a good hearty item . i assume you mean you are going to balance a larger board and use it as a turn table . this should work just fine for you . just remember , if your board is too large , the corners will droop . i have a couple of these - one in my cupboard for canned goods and another for a plant stand , so i can rotate it for trimming the plant . good luck ... marie

i have the short pitcher versa and it pours well into large openings like glasses or jars . the spout is about 2 inches across , so you might encounter some problems with pouring into 3 inch openings or less . the spout is also square ( ish ) and tends to retain a drop or so to decorate your counter . hope this helps .

i am not sure . my stove-top pyrex percolator is a 12-cupper , and when i `` wrap '' a filter around the filter cage spindle all is well even if i put in 10 coffee measures of coffee ( i like my coffee strong ) . the packaging for the brew-rite 's do n't say . if this is really large percolator ( like what they put out at neighborhood meetings ) , you could try it , and merely lay the filter `` flat '' in the filter cage with the middle hole over the spindle . most important is to cover the drip holes ( the ones in the bottom of the filter cage ) . brew rites will probably do this . still think you 're better off trying to find round `` flat '' filters that fit a 30-cupper .

just a few more data points . the medium has two lines the lower is just under 20oz ( about 19 oz ) and the upper is 24oz . it 's about 30oz all the way to the top ( where the seam between the inner and outer are welded ) . ( measured by weight with no grinds nor filter . ) note that this does n't seem to match the faq ( http : espro.ca faq-espro-press ) which notes 600ml 450ml ( 20.2oz 15.2oz ) for the upper lower marks . i presume the difference is assuming the grinds take up a volume of ~4oz .

i 've only cooked rice in my pressure cooker once and i used a 1-2 ratio ( rice to water ) . it took about 8 minutes and i did not add water to the bottom . just put the rice and water in the removable pot , move the dial to 'pressure ' and set timer at 8 minutes ... it was perfectly cooked .

good question ! i 'm assuming it would work since the seeds are hard . the fact that there are different settings to chop finer or thicker would also lead me to think yes , it would work . i would try and tell you but my flax seed is already ground ! ! good luck . i will say i love this pepper grinder and am considering getting a second for salt . the product is great !

nature of the business , i would think . `` to the buyer beware '' as the saying goes . shop around , find the best deal that suits your needs . do you want to use up your car and gas mileage , ( maybe hop the bus , or even train ) , or is it going to be less costly to buy online ? will it possibly save you valuable time or will it end up evening out ? if you find you need to return it , what options do you have ( i.e. , free return label , etc . ) , either way and how will that possibly affect overall cost ? takes a bit of figuring out what works best for you . btw : as of 12 25 2013 , i ca n't even find these at costco anymore . darn ...

there is no extra piece on the sides to put a second rod for children 's clothes . however , you could move the shelf up to any position , and suspend an extra rod from the bottom of the shelf . you would need a extra rod , plus 2 brackets ( approximately 1 inch wide by 4 inches long ) to attach and suspend from each end of the shelf . the rod would be attached to the suspended brackets . in other words , you would be duplicating the same type of arrangement as the upper brackets and rod . hope this answers your question .

that does n't sound normal , unless there 's just a tiny bit of coffee left in the pot . any coffee pot will scorch coffee if only a little bit of coffee is in the pot , but it usually takes much longer than an hour to scorch . i would assume the coffee pot is defective if it 's doing this within an hour . i 've never heard of being able to turn down the temperature on a warming pad , cause usually it 's not needed .

i 'm not sure . i have a queen mattress with a box spring and my bed sits up pretty high . i have a7 lb shorkie and he can barely jump up on it . ( although he 's not allowed on the bed ) . however , when i 'm at work i have a feeling that he 's up there ... bed skirts are pretty standard to your mattress size . i believe twin beds have extra long twin and regular twin .

there is jo need for a mattress pad unless you want a softer top . this matters is very firm . also very think so adding another 2 to 3 inches would make it even thicker . think about that when buying sheets . putting a top would make the gel useless . buy the 10 inch mattress if you want to put a topper .

do n't really have an answer but i 've often found huge variances in prices among the different vendors offering products on amazon . i have the red one with charcoal gray solid color bottom and it functions very well . some apples are more resistant to the blades than others . in that case i bang the loaded apple and cutter against my cutting board . i 'm really happy with this purchase since i love to spread peanut butter on thin apple slices and this makes light work of the preparation .

someone else took the bed out of the box and assembled it for me , so i do n't know if there were instructions in it or not . i would suggest that you contact the seller and ask for a set of instructions . i do remember the person assembled it said that some of the holes were not perfectly aligned and he had to drill a couple of holes to make the pieces fit together .

hi cassie , i believe that the answer is yes ! all the pots have handles that your pot rack should easily accommodate . the two saucepans have holes in the ends of their handles that measure approximately .3 '' by .4 '' . i do n't know the size of the hangers on your pot rack , but if those openings were too small to fit , you could always go to a hardware or home store and purchase and eyelet with a hook ( that is smaller in diameter and your pot rack arm ) . you would then slip the eyelet over your pot rack arm and then use the smaller hook end to hang the pan . you just need to make sure that the hook is small enough in diameter ( less than .4 '' by .3 '' ) to fit inside the hole of the saucepan . of course it may be possible that you might still need to store the lids and accessories somewhere else . my experience is that buying through amazon ( and costco ) gives you an excellent return policy , so if you did n't like them or they did n't fit your pot rack , you should be able to return them . i love cooking with these pans , they heat so evenly ( i use them on my magnetic induction rangetop ) . hope this helps , my apologies for not getting back to you earlier cassie , when you live on a lake you 're slammed by company all summer long ! sincerely , phil

fluffy is a relative term . even after washing it is not flat like a sheet but it is not two or three inches thick either but it has body . we like it and our heating system is set at 68 degrees for the cold nights we get in southwest florida .

i only make a six-cup pot of coffee , and timed the process this morning with my thermopen kitchen timer . from the time i pushed the start button ( mozart song plays the first time ) until the mozart song played the second time ( signaling the brew process is complete ) was 7 minutes , 54 seconds . i then let the pot sit another 3 minutes before pouring my first cup so most of the coffee can drain out of the secondary filter that is clipped into the pot , or carafe . i always take the secondary filter out of the carafe , or pot before pouring a cup of coffee . the filter will have some , not much , coffee remaining in it . i can not say how long for a full pot , or 12 cup pot of coffee . hopes this helps .

thanks for your question ! this mattress is made from 3 layers of high density memory foam . there is a 5 inch layer of high density therapeutic foam , a 2.5 inch support layer of high density memory foam and the top layer is a 2.5 inch layer of gel infused memory foam . unfortunately i do n't have the exact density of each layer but 'high density ' would mean 6 pounds per cubic foot or higher . i hope this helps !

works great just as it does on hardwood floors . however , i do n't use it on terra cotta ( mexican ) tile floors because they are uneven , and i 'm concerned that the vibration will eventually damage the machine . just like all other floor areas , you may want to thoroughly vacuum occasionally to clean edges and corners or sweep them out prior to running the neato . after years of roombas , love , love , love neato !

they will handle the oven just fine . i often start a dish on the stove top and then transfer to the oven to finish . dishwasher is n't recommended if you want to keep them pretty but it should n't hurt the performance of the pans .

i just washed mine and it washes up great ... just remember to change your water lever to small or medium because it does not soak up a lot of water and will cause your washer to overflow . ..i learned that the hard way . it is a great set just not as warm as i thought it would be but will be great with the weather warming up . love it !

all the knives are basically the same except for length . i usually cut small items with the smaller knives such as a radish . the larger knives would cut for example , a loaf of bread . i think that is how they work best for me . i actually used the shredder to shave cocoanut . hope that helps .

yes , it is very important to heat the milk first , as the yogurt maker simply holds it to the temperature that it has been cooled down to , what i do is , i heat the milk in a double boiler , have more control that way , and wo n't burn the milk , you will also need to stir it to keep it mixed up , aslo , i do add about 1 cup of powdered milk to it so it is thicker when done . i use the included thermometer to moniter the temp , then when it gets to around 180 degrees , i move it over to the sink that i have filled with ice water , i use the reusable icecubes and rainwater that i collect for the cool down water , it needs to be cooled to 120 degrees , then , i pour about 1 cup of the cooled down liquid into the culture that i saved from the last batch , then when dissolved i add it to the rest of the milk mixture , then after it is in the yogurt maker i leave it for about 8 hours , this has worked very well for me for quite a long time , i have been doing it for so long now that i just automatically do it the same way every time , there a so few steps , it is so fast . i hope

yup ! definitely . these are great . i personally use one or two to bring to work and one at home for my son 's food . i think it 's a bit large for a toddler or preschooler really as the compartments are deep , but it 's easy to store leftovers since you can just cover and pop it back in the fridge . it 's perfect for a salad or bunch of fruit in the large compartment , a very good size portion of cottage cheese in the second largest cup ( full cup at least probably but i have never actually measured ) and then some salad dressing in the smallest cup ( which only uses about 1 6 of the space ) . a sandwich would fit perfectly i think .

you really are n't supposed to use any floor cleaner with it . the steam does the work . never put anything but plain water in the tank . if you 're determined to use something along with the steam , an occasional spray from a bottle directly onto the floor would be the only acceptable cleaner . the beauty of steam cleaning is that it cleans and sanitizes without the toxic chemicals .

it does a good job with the hair , but we 've been disappointed because of the smell the vacuum emits . we have two labrador retrievers who live in the house , and we typically have to buy a new vacuum cleaner every two years because of the 'dog ' smell . no matter what we do or how much we clean them , they start to smell like dogs . we decided to go with a bagged vacuum this time to see if it would make a difference , and it has turned out to be worse ! it started smelling like 'dog ' within a couple of months . we 've changed the filters and my husband even put a bounce sheet over the exhaust filter , but nothing has helped . i 'm afraid we 're going to have to purchase a different vacuum cleaner .

great question : ) so first of let me start out by explaining vacuuming shag carpet and why its different . so this is one of the lightest vacuum cleaners made . however its a very powerful deep cleaner and the heaviest part of any vacuum cleaner is the suction motor . so i would not suggest returning it for a lighter vacuum as it will not clean as good . shag carpet is thicker and is also more absorbent of dirt and debri . in other words it will hold more dirt in it and also requires a more powerful vacuum to clean it like the prolux 6000. so yes it is normal for vacuum cleaners to be harder to push in shag as its sealed down to the carpet and really working to clean them . so you can get a lighter vacuum but i would not suggest it as it wont clean as good . so how to make it easier ? this sounds funny but you could vacuum backwards by trying to pull the vacuum more than trying to push it . you could also use the floor tool as its not as wide and would be easier to push . however doing that wont clean as good . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller )

they have 3 models ... . there 's the black creme model that is the same as the champagne creme model , but the plain black one has a flip top that looks like it has a grill on one side and a griddle on the other ( i did not see where a warming tray would fit on the all black model ) . i 'm guessing that the all black one is so expensive due to its grill griddle flip capability .

the slots on the footboard mounting bracket are between 1 4 and 5 16 ( 9 32 ) . i would say it will work taking into account the thread depth of your bolts . worse case is to file the slot or drill it out to accommodate your 5 16 bolt .

the fan is located along the rear wall of the unit . the noise level is quieter than most of our stainless steel competitors we tested against . we have noticed that some of the plastic units may be slightly quieter , but by design they are less efficient at removing moisture . honestly , to the average ear , it would n't even be noticeable : ) the best way i can describe it is as a low hum .

hello heather , thanks for the question . the stainless steel trays and racks that hold them remove from the dehydrating chamber leaving an easy to wipe down surface with no brackets or edges . those trays and racks may be placed in a dishwasher or sink , however the whole unit should not under any circumstances be put in a dishwasher or sink . there are many electrical parts and components present .

hello , i have to be honest and say i am not sure the mattress topper will cool down a memory foam mattress but i can tell you that the mattress topper is very thick and perhaps in conjunction with a mattress pad , it may be suitable for your needs . a bamboo mattress pad or the bamboo version of the mattress topper may work for you as i understand them to be cooler than other fabrics . i have three layers over mine - an thick egyptian cotton mattress pad , a bamboo mattress pad , and then the mattress topper . i hope this was helpful and i hope you find the right solution for your situation . : )

using it for thick smoothies might create a problem because the lid is made to strain water of fruit solids . if you wanted to use it for most juices , i suspect it would work . i think , though , that you could find better juice pitchers . for fruit-infused water , these are lovely , but they would be better if they held twice as much .

andrea , we bought one a few months ago . you do n't need the yogurt , too much added sugar and calories , we just use frozen fruit , all different kinds and i add parts of a banana , not frozen for a more creamier texture . it 's delicious , and if you want add mini chocolate chips on top mix with a little whipped cream , omg way better than ice cream and for people who have an intolerance to milk products , it wins hands down . enjoy

sorry brenda , not able to find where it 's made . not listed on the vacuum or in the accompanying paperwork . ( think if it was made in the usa , it would be proudly stated somewhere ) just says , `` manufactured for sears brands management corp . 1-800-4my-home . '' i can say that i was a tough sell when buying vacuums because i want something what works well on all levels of my home and is n't a `` toy '' . this vacuum has incredible suction both through the power head and the attachments . no matter how clean my house appears before i begin , i always have a remarkable amount of dust and hair in the dust canister when i 'm finished . the cord length is great and it 's relatively light for carrying up the stairs . i keep the attachments in a small tote bag because the clips that they provide to keep them on the handle just seem awkward and get bumped when vacuuming under the beds or in tight areas . ( my previous canister had a storage compartment but this bagless style does n't have one ) .

the unit comes with everything that is needed for a window installation . some installers may be leery about installing a large ac thru the wall without wall brackets , but i installed the unit as per friedrich ' instructions without any issues . i used 2 inch wood screws for my installation . there 's no way the unit would ever fall out unless the entire wall collapsed .

the bottles certainly have no problem fitting . the shelves are roomy . however , the mccormick bottles tend to tip forward or backward because of the way the bottoms of the shelves are constructed . each shelf consists of several metal rods running the width of the unit and resting on the outer frame . wider-bottomed bottles have no problem , but the mccormick bottles have very narrow bottoms that wobble a little on the rods . personally , i do n't mind . i 've got a zillion bottles of spices and these shelves are an economical solution for storage .

i have had the unit for several weeks now . we run it in our daylight live-in basement , which gets very damp in the summer . i was hunting something that does n't make much noise , as loud dehumidifiers are annoying . i was n't even using our old unit before i purchased the edv-400 because i could n't stand to listen to it . i could tell it was getting humid and damp . when we received the edv-4000 i was a bit surprised how small it was and the bucket was small as well . but , i have been very happy with it and do not regret it , at this point . the basement feels very comfortable , it sounds like a fan , and removes a good amount of moisture . as far as 1200 sg ft , i do have less area than that where it is running . i would say if it is completely open it would help . if there are many small rooms with doors , it may be a bit much or you may need two units .

hi there - there is a mixture of light to medium pink and purple plus a mauve color in this set . i think that this set would blend well in a lavender room . i hesitate to say that the light purple is lavender as there is so many different hues of purple lavender colors in a color wheel . the benefit of this set is that there is a wide array of colors that it should blend well in a lavender room . i hope this answer helps you . please let me know if you have any further questions . take care .

i 'm not sure if you 're asking about a specific quantified number or not . but this mattress tends to be on the firm side . it gives and cradles where it needs to , but it 's not a `` soft and sink '' feeling at all . i 've had mine for a year now , and i love mine !

not sure where they 're made . but , if you 're concerned about the quality i can tell you it is a nice set . do n't expect the knives to match the quality of any real chef knife ( $ 500+ per ) , but if you take care of them , no dishwashers - hand wash , and sharpen now and again ... they are very nice . i am super happy with the purchase .

hi carrie , this is a common question but the answer is absolutely no way should they ever be cut . the reason is that the underlying structure of all silicone baking mats is a fiber glass weave which should not be exposed by cutting the mat ( or cutting ingredients on it ) , nor should it be folded creased . best advice is to acquire a better suited pan , which will then be protected by the mat . i hope this helps . any further questions just ask ! best regards , matt - starpack team member

yes it does . i have a watts wp4v reverse osmosis system and i bought this kit a couple of months ago . i exchanged all 3 filters of the system from this kit . the extra carbon and sediment filter i put aside and will use them in another 4 months . this kit does not include the reverse osmosis membrane . if you need to replace it you must order it separately . the membrane should last for at least 5 years or so .

hi nick , thank you for your question . the happy toucan drawer is designed for k-cups and capsules that range from 45 to 50 mm in height . we would n't recommend our drawer for the pads since what separates each row of the drawer is a bar and not a solid divider . if you also use capsules then they should work . thanks for your inquire and please let us know if you have any other questions .

i apologize for not giving a more clear answer . i 've never had coffee from a vertuoline so i ca n't comment on it . but i 've made close to one hundred lattes on my de'longhi machine and have been happy with the temperature of coffee and milk with every cup . i have n't ever measured the temperature of the espresso and steamed milk made from my machine . and i do n't own a thermometer to do it -- or i would measure it and give you the results . but i drink several lattes each week -- and sometimes each day -- from starbucks , dunkin donuts , etc. , and the temperature of the milk and espresso made by my machine seems to be the same -- if not very close -- to those .

i 'm 6'1 and 205. it 's enough for me however while these are inexpensive the arm rests tend to break off after a couple of months . they are tack welded on the underside of the chair and not attached to the back of the chair . it happened to both the chairs i ordered . my opinion , if money is n't the main reason for buying this chair , i 'd buy something heavy duty for a man his size . if you are only using it very occasionally and not in a business environment it 'll probably work ( for a while ) .

hey lisa , after my a few tried with beets , it works for us . we have some experience you might like to know regard to how to use our envy slicer for best results : - regarding getting a better experience with carrots , zucchini , beets ... i remember that the first time we used carrots ourselves , the strips did n't come out from the blade as long strips . because carrots are hard , often their strips wo n't be as long as with soft vegetables such as summer squash , zucchini , eggplant , beets , etc . i practiced with zucchini ( as you can see on the package ) and were quickly able to get nice , long strips with our carrots . be sure to use fresh carrots , zucchini that are thick enough to fully utilize your slicer blades . - strongly recommend using fresh and thick veggies enough for best results . if it does n't work , it might be due to very rarely item which defective during shipping processing . although this product is very easy to use which is designed for `` no-brainer '' to use , it might need a little practice depend on various people 's desire . hope this help ! -jessica

hi katie , i have heard so many different answers to this question . i do n't think it matters what kind of juicer you use , they all are going to give you fresh , raw juice that has all the nutrients for you to consume right then and there . those nutrients you get will break down the longer you let the juice sit . i 've heard twelve hours , fifteen hours , etc , 72 seems like a lot . what i 've heard the most from people that have juiced for a long time is that it 's best to drink it right away so you can get all of those nutrients before they start to break down . now i do n't know if there is some scientific study and all that on this , but i agree that consuming it right away is the best thing to do . if you do n't mind my asking , did your daily schedule prevent you from drinking the juice as soon as you make it ? i know how that goes , it 's a little hard with three kids : )

this manual grinder sounds nothing like an electric grinder . it does make noise , and it does take longer to manually grind , but if you are down the hall in the kitchen , and the bedroom doors are closed , there should be no problem . the noise is about like taking a handful of gravel and swirling them around in your hands at a moderate pace . it takes me about 45 seconds to grind for a french press . it is part of the fun ritual of making coffee in the morning .

hey ... if you can find a 5lb ock elsewhere , go for it . though i do wonder how you can have a 5lb ock made for you . ( maybe with a special mold ? and where will you get the ock to use as a base for casting the mold ? well , i suppose you could ask around and see if you can find enough people who will let you measure and weigh their ocks . the problem may be not only in selecting a ock that makes you happy and feels right , but keeping it firmly set up for a proper casting to make your own ock . )

hi j , the ozone plate cartidge is made of ceramic . yes , this ozone generator will kill airborne mold spores and eliminate odor for a period of time . however , no ozone generator on the market ( no matter what a manufacturer will tell you ) will eliminate all mold spores in a contaminated area . this is because mold spores can hide in nooks and crannies in interior surfaces such as inside drywall and other porous material like clothing etc . that may not necessarily be reached by ozone purification . generally , ozone purification treatment is used after conventional mold clean-ups that involve a bleach scrubbing of contaminated surfaces . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) .

when i grind pepper corns , i strive for `` cracked pepper '' , but i always get a bit of `` fine ground '' even though i check the results after each pulse . that 's to be expected with a blade type processor . i 'm happy with the resulting `` mix '' .

i know this was asked a while ago , but i emailed the seller after i received the mattress ( which , i have only been sleeping on for two days but am very happy with so far ) . they emailed back that the 7-inch base layer of high-density foam is a 4lb density ... not sure about the others , but the base layer is most important when determining the overall durability , comfort , etc . i consider 4lb to be perfect for me , as that is on the medium-firm side .
