yes ! you can do just about anything with this food processor . when it arrives , there is a small booklet with a reference to a new york company . call the 800 number in order to purchase , a mixer attachment , wide slicing and grating blade and a couple more items . they are very inexpensive ( between 10 and 12 dollars ) . i ordered everything available . i love this food processor- the ny support people are exceptional also . 
it holds a lot and i have pushed the limits but , never measured exact cups . i know what you mean about leaking on the bottom , had that happen with a different one , not with this one . i mainly make sauces and salsas . 
yes . 
no - the attachments are listed in the description . 
i do n't think it is super loud , but it makes some noise ... i have not owned any others of these to have something to compare it to 
although i do n't have this machine anymore , i know this machine would do the job . the bowl is massive and the blade size is pretty substantial . best part about buying this machine , they have fantastic customer service . 
of course it is . although i had to return mine because of power failure , this machine is fabulous . 
hi , it only fits for a tilt head models which is the 5qts . thanks 
yes 
it did not fit my 6 qt kitchenaid , so it probably wo n't fit the 5 qt either . they are similar in size . 
i bought it to fit my 6 at and it does not fit . 
yes it is little tight but it will fit 
yes it does fit with the bowl attached . the only thing you have to store separate are the blades attachments . 
i bought this cover for my kitchenaid professional 600 and it did not fit . i 'm not sure about the professional 550 though . 
we have black and red as well . 
yes 
the handles are made of plastic and generally strong enough for daily use . due to the heat resistance of plastic is different with silicone , the handles do melt if leave touching with hot fry pan . please do not leave the handles in touch with hot edge of your cooking utensils to extend the life of this product . the handles of brush are made of stainless steel wire and are good based on our customer 's feedback . thank you for your questions . 
the handles are of average length . if you 're asking if the handles are extra long like a bbq grill utensil then no . 
the handles are urethra plastic and appear to be sturdy . i have looked for these spatulas for a good while and am delighted with these . 
yes . this is a very nice set of spatula . i am very happy with it . 
actually no instructions are needed . these are very easy to use . you only have to worry about the thickness of your fondant gumpaste . you simply press this on top of your fondant . 
yes you can - here are two sites which might help - the first is a video and the second discusses how to do it - good luck - marilyn http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=l-_wzsfjdpm http : www.wilton.com blog index.php go-figure-using-molded-fondant-to-make-people-and-animals 
the item just can be shipped to america abroad . hope for your understanding . 
do n't buy this ! i bought this a couple months ago , and almost every piece is broken . i loved it at first but not anymore ! i was just getting started & i could n't afford much , but i had to invest in another set . so , if you can but something more sturdy & durable 
the roller is similar in size to the 9 '' wilton roller . this set is a great deal . i teach a beginners deco class and i use these tools for them . 
just what you see in the photo . 
the cutter 's are pretty good , but not like a knife so some of the edges may be jagged , need to press down in one place for cleaner cut . 
your best bet is to contact the vendor directly . asking that question here poses it to those that have no control over changing your date of receipt . if it 's shipping from china , prepare to wait 4 - 6 weeks , and you still may not get it , as has happened to me with multiple orders for a variety of items . good luck ! 
not even a little ! ( being the scientist that i am i had to test ... put just water in , laid it on it 's side then upside down . no leakage . 
you do n't need to stand them up . the seal is very good . i put them on their side in the freezer and they were fine . 
yes the lids seem airtight to me . they have screw on grooves that secure on pretty well . interesting idea to use them for dry snacks . will have to try . 
manufactured in china 
no , i do n't think they would stay frozen very long . i would freeze the pops , put them in a lunchbox and then `` drink '' the contents like a smoothie . here 's just one recipe that i use : 1 cup plain non-fat greek yogurt 1 cup of berries ( blueberries and raspberries are our favorites for this recipe ) 2 very ripe bananas 1 teaspoon real maple syrup or honey ( optional ) blend the ingredients until very smooth . set the pop molds in a tall container to hold them steady as you pour in the smoothie . pour into pop molds . make sure to leave 1 inches of the mold because the ingredients will expand as they freeze and can push the cap open if overfilled . put on the pop lid . place freeze pop molds upright in the freezer . when frozen , remove the pop lid and enjoy . ( you may need to rinse the outside of the pop container just a bit so that it 's easier to squeeze up the pop treat or let the heat of your hands do the trick . ) 
i just washed mine with a little soap and warm water ! ! and have used them many times this summer , hope that helps : ) xo 
the recipes are available to download in e-book format , they do not come in the box- if you check your email form sunsella which you received after purchase with tips the link to download is described there- otherwise contact sunsella through amazon and they will tell you how to download . 
hi there , we now have a free '50 ice pop recipes ' ebook which we are giving away rather than just the 3 free recipes . you can get it by visiting our facebook page . thanks , mike sunsella 
no . i have been using them for several months and have not noticed any smell . 
the tops may be tight enough for that . i always freeze them standing up in a tall glass , so i 'm not sure if they would leak . leave at least an inch at the top and kind of let the air out and they seal . yes , you eat them by squeezing and slurping . fyi ... they contain more than a regular popsicle , not quite twice as much , so they 're a pretty big serving . 
at the gilt web site ( once you have an account , search `` gourmet fork '' or `` gourmet knife '' ) , but the knife looks rusted in the picture . i have not ordered . also , an internet search for `` replacements boda nova gourmet '' : over there they sell at an exorbitant price , and the measurements for most flatware does n't match with what amazon sells and the pictures are a lot less shiny , so may not be identical . 
no , the box states made in vietnam 
just 5 pieces . 
i contacted the manufacturer in israel and was told there are no instructions available in english . if you received instructions in hebrew you may want to take them to a local synagogue and see if you can have them translated . 
do n't know exactly , but try kosher stores they might have it . good luck 
this comes with just one fine mesh screen . 
the bowl does n't spin it has suction cups to hold it ... it holds about 3 pounds sifted and i have no idea what micron but if it 's kosher then it 's got ta be pretty small 
so hot that i ca n't drink the coffee without milk 
i never really stood and waited to see . i just plug it in and it does its thing ... i would say within 15 min its boiling ... 
hinged to come off on some models , not on mine 
16 '' h x 9 '' w over all , , watts 750 
made in china , however , if you 're really asking if it needs tevilah , it does not . it has a hechsher from r ' asher eckstein . 
most probably made in china , good with it , but pouring by pressing ( air ) only , no electronic pumping 
mine automatically goes to keep warm , as you said , so perhaps you will need to have it replaced . it only boils for about 10 minutes . hope that helps ! 
you have to move it out from the place it is set 
if i understand the question correctly , it dispenses when ( and only when ) one presses on the large ( compression ) button on the top of the unit . 
customer service ( 888 ) 552-0033 
wash in cold water , no detergent . instruction says you must wash at least once to activate absorbency . it 's the pits to dry in dryer . i had to clean out the dryer thoroughly and still found little hidden piles the next week . my guess is that hosing and turning the mat frequently while hosing may work but i do n't have direct experience . good luck 
i usually hang it over a chair to dry outside , but it takes longer during the winter . so , i put it in the dryer with no heat & no bounce sheet for about an hour . then , i hang it over a chair indoors for about a day to get it completely dry . 
the `` rubber '' backing on the runner is about 1 16 inch thick . the fabric part has a slight shag quality of maybe 1 8 inch , but it is soft and mashes easily . i measured . my suggestion is give it a try and return if it 's too much . i like the runner . it does seem to help contain water and dirt that is tracked in . 
i am at work but just looking at a ruler i doubt they would clear the door . something to keep in mind ... .anything that is going to be absorbent enough to trap water and dirt has to have some amount of fiber mass to get the job done and remain durable . i think you would be disappointed with any product that would be thin enough to fit . 
i only us hot water and a little detetgent.or a little white vinger kills any order . 
each rug is 24 '' x 60 '' 
it should be fine for your needs . since you have the item already , you know what they are like . 
you could but it would n't have the border any more and might unravel . 
this is a leave-in thermometer , for use while food is cooking in the oven . 
yes , there is , actually 
yes 
it is n't instant but should read a temperature in 15-30 seconds . 
it 's a pointed tip that you can push right into the meat . 
yes 
yes you can stick it in the meat to see if it has reached proper temperature . i would not leave it in the meat . 
no 
yes 
no , this is just for meat temperature and it works great . 
yes i think it looks just like it ! 
it 's a little shiny and gold , but not a metallic finish 
it 's just paper . i would n't give it to a 3 year old . it 'll get destroyed on the first day 
i am a international customer , so it would melt . 
only 1 
it 's thin but great quality . i 'd guess 1 8 inch . it 's fantastic . i use it all the time to make granola and baked goods . i love it . 
no info of that type is provided . it says that it 's made from fda approved materials . i love mine . 
i do n't really know , but i do n't think i would chance it either . it is too bad that it is not made in a smaller size or varying sizes do to all different companies making there own varying sizes . i guess if it did not fit my pan snuggly then i would save it for one of them that it does , and would probably use parchment paper . it is just too bad that bakewear ca n't be made to be indistructable . oh well what is a person to do . 
i had no success whipping eggwhites have not tried it with cream . my old braun could do both . 
it charges off a 110 outlet works great love it 
our unit says it was made in china .

yes you have to hold the button , but it is in a very convenient position so that you hand is over the button while holding the shaft . very nice product . we put it in our kitchen here at the store and it is wonderful ! ! ! ! karen eurostoves 
yes . this model has a stainless steel wand and its own beaker , whisk , chopper and pure masher attachment . plus the soup xl pan blender - an attachment specially designed for blending soups directly into the saucepan without splashing . 
yes , it is u.s.a compatible . thank you for inquiring ! 
yes , it snaps over the hanger which is normal size . very sturdy and i love mine ! 
there is no zipper or velcro to keep the pockets closed , however the pockets are pretty snug to hold jewelry items . i would not suggest this for traveling , as you would risk losing items . it is perfect for home to keep on the back of a door . i find that if my jewelry is hidden away in a box or drawer and i ca n't see it , i usually do n't wear it . 
the outside pockets are 3-3 4 '' wide , 3 '' long . the inside pockets are 4 '' wide , 3 '' long . i use it for my brighton jewelry - watches , sets , individual pieces . it 's perfect ! 
the pockets look to be sewn . i have n't had any problem with pockets separating . i store one to two pair of earrings in each pocket . easily visible and no more earring trees on top of furniture . hangs beautifully in my closet . liked the first one so much , i ordered another . 
nope . put in a long sheetrock screw and hang the vacuum on that . 
no 
we use it regularly to clean the car . the only problem is its a little heavy , and of course , you have to charge up the battery following the cleaning . because its a little bulky , hard to get under the seats , etc . works great in the trunk . has enough suction power to deal with most stuff . 
it comes with a small crevice attachment 
no , its a single speed ... ..but works great . runs on a battery that is easy to charge . unit is easy to clean , and reassemble . i have other b & d tools which use the same battery , which is a plus . 
it is a 18 volt rechargeable hpb18 . that 's all i know . 
box states , `` made in china '' . nothing on product itself . 
these are traditional `` slow '' pops that you would freeze after you add your liquid . 
they are plastic . the the stick side kids hold are perfect size for little hands , and the end that goes in the mold is short so i do n't worry about the kids choking on it when they get to the end of their pops . 
i handwash all of it as reccomended by the manufacturer . other reviews i 've read said people had problems with melting in the dishwasher . better safe than sorry , handwashing only takes a short time and will save you the hassle of replacing it should it damaged in the dishwasher . 
i found a near perfect better replacement . ring pops leftover plastic ring ! my kids left one in the car and it looked the same size as the sticks in the zoku , so i tried it . i have to fill the individual mold with a little more liquid because they are just a tad bigger and the part of the ring that would seat in the pop while freezing is n't as long but the result is a little larger pop when finished , the kids fight over the ring pop one , so i am saving them from any ring pops they acquire in the future . now , before anyone says ring pops are unhealthy , i bought a bag of 4 at dollar general for a dollar and you can smash the candy with a hammer and have 4 sticks for a buck . actually enhances the product and it might be a new design for zoku to turn them into rings as my kids love it . hope this helps . 
i would guess 1oz . they are like a shot . they are a perfect snack for my toddler . 
i have never had this situation , so i do n't know , but i will do some research because it is easy to lose one of the sticks . okay , i just checked the zoku website and they have them for sale . not sure about alternatives . 
i 've read about doing that . not something i would have thought of but i 've heard it 's a good alternative to other liquids . 
any kind of pudding , any kind of yogurt . i also use them without the handles to make fruity round ice juice cubes to put in wine glasses for summer coolers . 
i have n't tried but i 'm wondering when you say gelatin pop , are you not planning on freezing it solid ? i think you 'd have a hard time extracting them with the pop not getting messed up other the stick coming out . the molds are can be a little stiff when cold . never a problem for a solid pop but could be with a gelatin pop . 
zoku is a us company , based in new jersey , is a product design company . all of their products are designed here and manufactured in china . all carry us patents for their unique designs . i hope that helps ... please let me know if you had more specific questions . 
hard plastic . you run them under warm water for a little bit and they slide right out . 
4 ounces . although the manufacturer says 3 ounces , i poured 4 ounces in to the fill line . 
4 inches long , 2 inches x 1 inch at the base , holds slightly less than 1 2 cup . 
hi - it is a little difficult . we need to run the pop under some hot water for a few seconds or so in order to pull the pop out of the silicone mold . very young children would need help - maybe 0-6 yrs . just for the fact that you need a little strength to pull off the mold . 
all of zoku 's products are certified to be bpa and phthalate free by one of the world 's leading testing agencies . zoku 's products are tested multiple times for the u.s. , european , and japanese markets to ensure compliance . 
we have the fish mold and use smoothies all the time and they come out yummy every time ! ! ! we use yogurt with it too & # 128522 ; 
what 's a chocolate station ? 
not as far as i know . i would return it as having a manufacturing defect . 
about one hour 
product info on packaging states , made in china , bpa and phthalate free . the manufacturer 's website is zokuhome.com . 
mine are always easy to pull out . be sure not to overfill it or it will spill out as it freezes and stick to the rim of the base . also if the outside of the molds are wet , they could also stick to the base when they freeze . lastly , the liquid you pour in should not be cold , cool or room temp is fine . the reason is that if the liquid is already cold , the top of the mold ( part with the most exposure to air ) can freeze over first , creating a cap . because the liquid below ca n't expand up because of the ice cap , the liquid must expand out , stretching the mold as it freezes . this may be what 's causing problem . warmer liquids freeze more uniformly , so they will tend to expand up , lifting the popsicle stick , instead of out , stretching the mold .

2.8 quarts . 
you can leave the spout open so it does n't whistle . i 've found that the whistle is not very loud to begin with though . 
i would assume so but do not know for certain 
yes , it does work well on a gas stove . it 's used daily , and has held up well . 
i 'm afraid i do n't know the answer to this question as i sent it back . the kettle is very lightweight and cheap , so i went with the paul deen one instead . 
yes , it bends just fine , but it 's a thick piece of foam , and it 's natural tendency is to straighten and fill out . 
my mattress is 8 '' . with the extra 4 '' , i had to buy 3 sets of new sheets , made for 14 '' mattresses . amazon prices were n't bad . 
the dimensions of the box and the weight will depend on the size that you need . if you could let me know what size you are looking to purchase i can get the shipping information for you . 
depends on what you mean by `` holes all through it . '' the foam is porous , but the holes are n't large . it does n't look like swiss cheese or anything . 
i do n't know the density , but my wife has steel rods in her back and she loves the topper . my daughter also has severe back problems and loves it as well . we have ordered this topper three times now ( one for each bed ) with no problems . the oldest one is about a year old and is holding up very well , still sleeps as good as the first night . 
this is a mattress topper . ca n't imagine it would be comfortable without a mattress . 
do you mean , `` does it fit the mattress ? '' after a few hours the foam fully expanded to a thick 2 inches . my mattress pad fit the bed perfectly on the sides , maybe just a tad small , but the sheets hold it nicely . 
i believe it 's 5 years and only will cover if a fault in craftsmanship . 
memory foam is 2 '' thick . the down alternative is part of the cover and is barely 2 '' of fluff but when you put the foam in the cover , together it makes a nice thick topper that is very close to the 4 '' as advertised . 
it removes the rest of impurities that your house filteration does not remove . if no house filteration then it would remove all impurities by changing your filters as advised . this would lengthen the life of your keurig . 
no you do n't have to use their coffee packs only . yes you can use ground coffee in a filter aaccessory . with regard to tea , i use regular tea bags . 
dimensions are 13.0 '' h x 9.8 '' w x 13.3 '' d according to the keurig site : http : www.keurig.com brewers elite-brewing-system 
hello , yes , the filter filters out nasty tap water . i have not had a bad cup of coffee with this machine . i also think the very best and probably cheaper in the long run is to only use filtered water in the first place . we have a brita and i refill from that all the time . i do use the charcoal filters also , but , i bought them so i should use them , right . hope this helped . 
there are 3 different cup sizes , but the small cup is very small . i believe it is only 8 oz . i 'm not where i can look at it and have only had it for a very short time , but i use the middle setting for my cups at home because they are bigger than 8 oz . i have n't used the large size yet . 
super easy , you push the button on the left to turn the machine on . the button on the right will then start blinking , once it stops blinking it is heated and ready to use . you pop in a capsule ( lift lever , there is only one way it fits , very intuitive ) , lower the lever and press the right ( yellow ) button . manual just means that you have to press the button again to stop it . with automatic there is a fixed amount that comes out , with manual you can decide how strong big you want your coffee to be . make sure there is water in the reservoir before you use . once finished , just push the left button again to switch off the machine . 
designed in switzerland , made in china . yes , it has a global warranty - most eu countries 3 years , then there is another list of countries in which it is 2 years , and usa 1 year warranty . i have had it about 3 months , and it appears to be well-built . like another reviewer said , its ' simplicity makes it less likely to break . 
yes , it does 
yes it does . it is a pretty slick product . i am impressed with it , and the espresso machine , compared to what i get at places like starbucks . there are certainly better lattes to be had at high end coffee houses , but these are good products . 
just going off google images , in comparison to what i received - it 's the aeroccino plus ! 
no , you have to buy their pods ( and they 're not the standard size that go into k-cup machines ) . so , make sure you look at the price of those pods and factor that into your decision . it turns out to be kind of pricey ; on the other hand , the coffee is excellent . 
nespresso probably configures them for the country of purchase . my unit was purchased and delivered in the usa . and the model includes us in the designation . the nameplate shows 120v , 60hz only which means it will not work at 220v , 50hz . 
on the back it says 120v-60hz 1250w . i 'm using it in the us and works fine . 
we ship via ups - you might be able to pick it up at ups , but you would need to contact ups . 
they make things . dark things . evil things . this-coffee-doesn't-taste-very-good things . you can use them to disappoint yourself and everyone you love to produce substandard beverages using your own grinds through the nespresso machine . i 'd rather get a christmas stocking full of dead hamsters than a cup of coffee made with self-provided grinds in a nespresso machine . but then , maybe other people like dead hamsters . 
i used this on my oreck xl gold and it worked perfectly . as i remember it is an oem part . 
mine is an xl and the replacement works great . not sure about his model , but i 'd say it 's worth a try . i think it should work . 
all `` xl '' s do not use the same size or type of brush roll , because `` xl '' by itself is not any specific model . `` xl '' is merely an oreck trademark used with dozens of different upright model series . fit goes by your specific xl model number , not just the fact that you have an `` xl '' . xl model numbers start with `` u '' or `` xl '' , but are followed by 4 numbers , and often an alphabetical suffix after those numbers . those 4 numbers ( and sometimes the suffix ) , determine whether or not this xl brush roll will fit your xl model . for example : xl21 , xl2000hh , and xl2000rb are 3 different `` xl '' models , but , each has its own different size or type of brush roll , that wo n't work with the other two . 
i never was able to determine if it would fit so i ordered and it worked . the oreck site was no help . you will probably need to take a chance as i did it it looks like the right paart . sorry i ca n't give you something more definite . 
its fabric . 
3x3 going around 
the chairs are sturdy if you do a good job putting them together but the fabric feels not that comfortable . have n't tried to clean them yet . 
the fabric is like a beige-y , ivory , neutral color . not quite as `` white '' as it looks in the picture - it 's a little darker , but very elegant . i have a white light grey ivory themed room , and the chairs work great in the room . hope this helps ! 
yes , it is solid wood . 
the glass is tempered and of good quality . 
leather is black wood is dark brown . i got this set about 5 months ago . it is ok , the glass looks good . the chairs are cheaply made . 
no , it is not solid wood . it does n't quite look like compressed board but it likely is some type of manufactured wood and painted the dark brown cherry wood color . still looks fabulous , and feels sturdy . we 've gotten lots of compliments on our set and we love it . 
its leatherette 
it 's more like dark browne . 
the base of the table is not available for separate purchase . 
five boxes total . the main table and legs in the largest box , around 100 lbs , that box easier to handle with two people . the chairs came in four boxes , two chairs per box , each box about 40 lbs and easily handled by one person . 
its made from birch hardwood . 
it has removable leaf , nice table . 
ours was darker than it looked in the picture . pretty dark really . 
no 
i have n't used anything and it looks fine 
we do n't sell it we just buy a plastic and put it on top as a protecter 
it is brown and it is quite dark . 
no 
my grandson is 2 & has no problem sitting at it . the seat is 11 `` from the floor . my 7 yr old grand daughter sits at it also . it really is a nice set . 
the table top measures 20 '' wide by 23 5 8 '' long and is 20 1 2 '' tall . i have twin grandsons that are two years old and it is perfect for them . it is very well made and easy to assemble . 
it has a urethane coating in it . very durable . the kids have used paint & markers & it has all washed off 
they probably would not fit pushed in all the way , and the narrow ends are only a little bit wider than the chairs . so it would be cozy but if you are using it for play meals or short-term use as a kids table at family meals it would probably work okay . you would probably want to get a larger table if you would regularly be using it for 3-4 children doing projects or eating at it . 
the wood looks like white oak but is most likely a white pine . the way the table and chairs are constructed have proven to be very strong . my toddler twins have bashed and battered them for a few months now and everything is still holding together tightly . i can stand on the table and sit in the chairs and it easily holds my 200 pounds . 
my grandchildren are two and two 1 2 and play with this table every week . i 've never had a chair tip over . very steady and well constructed 
i painted mine with geometric patterns to match our grandsons playroom . i did not do anything before i painted . i put on a dealer after i was done to make sure the paint did not get worn off . i have have it this way for over 6 months and no problems so far and it looks great ! ! 
yes - definitely . 
i just measured mine : 20.5 inches from floor to top of table . 
i did n't see it specified anywhere . i sit on them at times without issue though . 
3 4 '' round by just about 1 4 '' thick . 
yes . these are strong . 
i have been using mine for 8 years with no problems 
nope ! they are clean and paint dye free . 
no glue is required for these , but when they break , its like gun powder all over the place . the little ones like this hold up better . 
this is a more complicated question than you might think . the power of the magnet is n't the only determining factor . other things to consider are the type of metal you 're planning to use it on ( stainless vs. regular steel ) , the thickness of the paint ( if any ) , and what are you trying to support ( paper , plastic clips , etc . ) . using a single disc i was able to hold 20 standard ( 20 lb . ) sheets of paper on a smooth steel cabinet with thin paint , 18 on a smooth steel door with thick paint , and 15 on a textured refrigerator with standard paint . i also used card stock ( 80 lb . ) sheets and got up to 9 , 8 , and 7 sheets respectively . when i opened the doors most of them fell , but that was because the sheets did n't stick to each other very well . if i had glued the magnet to a clip and used the clip to hold the paper , it likely would hold more weight since it would be in more direct contact with the metal - but it would also depend on how far out the clip stood because of leverage . i estimate that these magnets are 1.5 to 2 times as strong as typical refrigerator magnets that you buy at large retailers . 
i think they will be strong enough . i am using ceramic pieces glued to some of them and they are holding strong . i mostly am crocheting little miniature hats and dresses for them , but having no trouble with the heavier ceramic pieces . they are holding stronger than any magnets i have ever used . hope this helps . 
since `` north '' and `` south '' are really artificial constructs for a magnet 's inherent polarity , it really does n't matter . if you want to use them for teaching kids they can mark them and figure it out . if you just want to hot glue them into bottle caps for the refrigerator door , that wo n't matter . 
hi ! yes they are ! hope this helps ! good luck !

while it has the exact same cap and works the same way , the bottle is larger ( 1.2 l vs .75 l ) and made better . i had two mastrad 's before buying this one and both developed a leak within the first week of use and had to be returned . 
yes , you can carbonate water with less than 1.2 liter in the bottle . i have not tried 2 cartridges . it might be dangerous pressing second cartridge into a pressurized bottle . chilled liquid and some ice in the bottle seemed to help with more fizzle . 
both the sodaplus unit and the co2 cartridges are manufactured in taiwan . thank you for your interest ! quest products , inc . 
no . it uses standard 8 gm seltzer cartridges . search amazon for `` seltzer charger . '' i have found that the leland chargers available here on amazon are the best value . 
hi joseeeph -- yes , you can use most other brands of co2 in the soda plus including mosa but , of course , it works best with the soda plus co2 cartridges . regards , aaa kitchenstuff 
not sure how it compares with fizz giz but the sodaplus produces excellent carbonation levels . the trick is to make sure the canister is very cold before adding water and carbonation . 
no . the piece that causes puncturing of the cartridge is a tube that is threaded at one end . the tube is just long enough for small ( 8 gram ) cartridge . so the only way to use a longer cartridge is to get a longer tube with the same thread . there is no indication that the munfacturer makes such . you can use more than one cartridge i suppose . one cartridge gives plenty of fizz as long as you drink it right away . the resealing cap can only hold what pressure is still there after you open and pour some , so the lower the fluid level the lower the pressure left in the liquid . 
i have some reservations . it does n't make the drinks fizzy enough . i think i should have bought something like a soda stream . 
almost instantly , the colder the fluid the better absorption the more time you wait before opening will actually let it carbonite more 
its a little tricky but you just pull down on the top . its just that it really sticks the first few times . i was afraid i was going to break mine but a brave friend just pulled hard and it opened . good luck ! 
never measured it but i would say 2 dt may be 
it works just as well either way . usually depending on what you are ironing . its got good even heat and lightweight . i really like mine . 
yes . on my iron it 's gray . it 's a little bit difficult to open . i set my iron down flat and flip it open , then set it back up on the end to fill it up . then it just snaps shut . 
of course , providing the recipe specifies pounds or ounces or grams ... 
the weight number does n't lock ; you can add & subtract food items and the total will adjust . be aware that the weight displays in kg you 'll have to convert to lbs . if that 's what you 're looking for . hope that helps . 
approx . 71 2 x21 2 '' 
i do n't know about bpa but the seller should . the description will also include measurements . i have one that 's 9x13 so i know they come in smaller sizes . hope this helps ! 
hi gottaluvlabs , please not trim the mat . doing this will expose the fiberglass core which would make it unusable . the only solution is to have overhang , unfortunately . we are currently looking at adding new sizes so you can keep an eye out for that . happy baking ! brightspring 
i think one unless it states otherwise 
very much so . i have used mine over 50 times and i can tell you nothing sticks to it . the only thing you ca n't do is cut on it . 
made in china 
it 's about 1mm thick.it 's very strong . i love it ! 
dear i. hadianto , the mat is most effective when laid flat on a half sheet tray . the mat would still work but it does n't fold like paper does so a quarter sized mat would probably your best option . i hope this helps . kind regards , brightspring 
hi hanna , the mat is made in china . however this mat is made of the highest quality materials and our mats go through rigorous testing to ensure they meet our ( and our customers ' ) standards . these mats meet all necessary us regulations , and by using reputable and trusted manufacturers in china we are able to bring you a great quality product at an affordable price . i hope this helps with your enquiry . the brightspring team 
the cord is on the bottom with a wrap-around storage design around the base . i ca n't get this to match up ( not that i 've tried really hard ) . 
the only difference is the color . the white ones with the colored trim are the standard ones the company typically carries . i believe the black ones with the colored trim were custom done for a different company , as they are not offered by the manufacturer or in any local retail location . 
well , i think your food will over cooked . i do n't know what will happen longer then 3 hrs , i have never try it . 
this crock-pot does n't cook , it just warms . the oatmeal would already need to be cooked .

it 's not stainless steel , but a sturdy aluminum . 
this unit uses approximately 0.42 amps . 
unfortunately i do n't know , but i can say it did not appear to be a power burden on any outlet we have used thus far . 
it does not . i just unplug it . not a big deal for where it sits . 
maybe about a foot . not long at all . 
the unit is not designed for use with uncooked food . if a recipe calls for uncooked meats , it should be fully cooked before combining with other ingredients and heating it in the unit . 
it works like a crock pot . it is a crock pot . it slowly heats your meal , supposing your lunch , so when you prep it in the am , it is ready for lunch . that is all . does n't keep anything cold , does n't promise to keep anything warm while unplugged , and it is meant to be plugged in for use . hope that clears things up ! 
no its in a sealed canister in the crock while it is warming . you smell nothing until you open it to eat.we have a lot of complainers in my office about smells so this perfect for taking lunch with you and it is warm and ready whenever you are . this is probably the best purchase ever for me when it comes to taking my lunch . 
the inserts are sold separately and are made of stainless steel . for replacement parts and availability , please call us at 1-800-323-9519. we are open monday through saturday , 8:00 am through 8:00 pm eastern . 
yes 
the insert is metal . and , why would there be a need to microwave , since you can plug it in ? 
no 
i do n't know the temp , but it gets refrigerator cold food , hot in time for lunch . 
50 watts . 
the diameter is approximately 5.75 inches and the height is approximately 5.5 inches . 
had to get it down from the closet ( giving you some information there ) the manufacture is five star pillow in los angeles . 
not sure - i would not purchase this product . it 's extremely lumpy 
i do n't know for sure . 
hi , authorize dealer for 5 star bamboo memory foam pillows is ksk enterprise . contact phone # 8582544787 
hi , thanks for your question . this pillow is available from several different marketplace sellers . sellers set their own prices and we do n't have any information about how they set their prices . if you 'd like to contact one of the sellers directly , you can do so by going to their storefront page and clicking on `` contact the seller '' in the bottom right-hand corner . i hope this helps ! 
i do n't know . what i do know is : i really like this pillow . i have bought and returned many others prior to buying this one . if it last at least 2 yes . i will gladly buy another one . hope this helps . 
i do n't know for sure . i believe they are . 
do not know 
ours ended up not being actual memory foam so it was any good . they do make them with memory foam but there hard as a rock . 
i also emailed mr. coffee about this directly . unfortunately , the short answer is `` no , it is not bpa-free . '' i have pasted the email reply i received underneath the product webpage link for this model , so if you wish you can verify that there is no mention of bpa-free plastic : http : www.mrcoffee.com iced-tea-makers bvmc-tm33.html -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - thank you for contacting mr. coffee , a brand of jarden consumer solutions . in response to your inquiry regarding bvmc-tm33 ; unless it is listed on the website , it is not bpa free . at jarden consumer solutions ( jcs ) , we are committed to producing trusted household products that meet or exceed applicable product standards . bpa is a key component in the production of polycarbonate plastics . polycarbonates ( pc ) are used in a variety of applications in the appliance industry where strength , durability and clarity are required . bpa is also present in certain thermo set epoxies used in coatings , adhesives , paints , etc . phthalates are primarily used in vinyl to make the material more pliable flexible . a vast majority of our products are made from bpa free plastics such as polypropylene ( pp ) , acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ( abs ) , styrene-acrylonitrile ( san ) , high impact polystyrene ( hips ) , polyethylene ( pe ) , etc . and inorganic materials such as glass , which do not contain bpa . currently , polycarbonates ( pc ) continue to be recognized as safe for food contact applications by the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) . jcs purchases polycarbonates ( pc ) from trusted suppliers , who monitor to ensure what they sell complies with all current federal , state and local health and safety regulations . we appreciate your business and are happy to help if you have any further questions or concerns . sincerely , gordon jarden consumer solutions 
it holds 92 ounces to the ice mark on the pitcher , and 96 ounces to what i consider the max ( bottom of the pouring lip ) . 
our pitcher was 9.5 inches tall , 4.5 inches top diameter and 5.5 inches bottom diameter . it just broke because of the thin glass problem . replaced with classic pitcher 64oz by us acrylic which is almost the same size and essentially unbreakable . even the lid fit . however , note this bpa-free pitcher is plastic which may be a concern for some ( the machine is also plastic but not bpa free ) 
nope 
yes . we use gallon bags all the time 
using my measuring cup ... 4 cups brings the water to the `` max fill '' line . 
110 . 
the tea that it brews does come out hot ; which is why you have ice or cold water in the bottom of the glass pitcher prior to pushing the brew button . if you are looking to make hot tea ( and not specifically iced ) there are other electric tea pots kettles on the market that would probably work much better . i have seen one or two where you can actually select the desired hot brewing temperature ... .which is a great feature . anyway , i hope that this information helps . 
sorry it has taken so long to get back to you on your question . i had to go pull the box and the information booklet on it to find the answer to your question on whether this is bpa free . the answer is , i am not sure . there is nothing on any of the documentation that would say that either the basket nor the water storage unit are bpa free . in other things that i have purchased in the past that have been bpa free it has had it clearly labeled on the box and then further explained within the literature inside of the manuals , but this does not mention any information on it being bpa free . so for that , i can not vouch . you may want to check with mr. coffee directly for that particular information . i wish i could have been more help to you on this one ! take care ! 
i have not tried that myself . but from the looks of it and the way it performs i do n't see why not . it is a great item 
no . this product is meant for 120 volt outlets and we do not recommend the use of an adapter . 
sure just do n't turn the empty one on , they have separate controls ... 
200 watts . our products are specifically designed to be used in the u.s. or canada , with 110-120 volts . 
you can use it for cheese fondue but oil wil crack the crock pot . 
you may use our slow cookers on the warm setting , or our warming units ( little dippers ) , to melt chocolate . 
space for a spoon to stick through . 
yes just like regular crock pots -- and you can put the crock in the microwave to reheat things quickly as long as you do n't put the lid on it . 
they are crockpots for cooking . only the base is designed differently for the opportunity to hook them up together . for example , for a buffet party . 
two ovals 7 '' x5 '' . very useful for warm dips , gravies etc . harry krebs 
they are one quart each . 
the temperature on the outside is ok. you can make hot tea and then transport it easily . for me is perfect . simple , nice and very usefull 
i really do n't know . the plastic part under the lid cracked and broke into several pieces , so i no longer have the cup . i would n't recommend buying it ! 
although i always use the straw with it you could definitely use it without one as well . the spout has a sliding plastic cover that does not seal liquid it as well as some of the other cups if turned on it 's side or upside down it is sure to leak out . for that reason i always use the straw and keep it upright at all times . if you have a hot beverage in it , i do n't know how you would use the straw to drink without scolding yourself , so it was designed to be used both ways . hope this helps . 
no . liquids leak out just like any tumbler when tipped . 
as of 2014 we are only including a plastic straw with this tumbler . the tumbler housing is completely stainless inside and out . ( double wall ) only the lid portion of the tumbler has an acrylic window straw insert area . 
i only use this tumbler for cold drinks , once filled with some ice it stays cold for a couple of hours . 
ask the manufacturer 
i have a 50 gm and 500 gm standard that used to check the little pronto scale when i received it . it is dna . right on at both weights . 
yes , weigh the plate first then push the button and it 'll change back to `` 0 '' and then put your food in the plate and it shows the weight of the food only 
l 7 '' x w 5-1 2 '' x h 3 4 '' 
funny i do n't see that on mine . .. only shows up if i remove a container after tare has been set . if you are seeing this with nothing on the scale , hit tare and see if it goes away . if not you may have a defective unit . 
i would say so . it is a very accurate little scale . i do n't know what you weigh the soap in , just make sure your container is not so large that it covers the digital readout . i use this scale for packaging feta cheese in 8-oz . deli containers and it works beautifully . 
china 
the display is n't huge , but i feel like it is adequate and very clear . 
no 
the numbers are a light blue against a darker blue background . they are very visible at an angle and easy to read . 
no , it does n't . 
the smell is very slight and it was no longer noticeable after 1 maybe 2 days after opening it . 
i have not found the sleep innovation 4 '' topper hot . i love sleeping on it and i can honestly say , i have not slept so well in a long time . i love this topper . amen 
it will make it more comfortable.. but it will still be firm . the topper should make your existing bed feel better then ever . 
tried it with and without , found i prefer with sheets . without sheets , i was using a sleeping bag but the pad still got dirty over time . with sheets , it was kept clean . but be sure and use the `` deep '' pocket fitted sheets , because you 're adding 4 '' to the depth of your mattress . 
i 'm not sure of the weight , but it was heavy for me as i am72 yrs . old and stand 4ft.8in . but for a man it might not be that much . all i know is i love my topper and would never part with it . it has helped my hip pain and my hips do n't hurt any more . 
yes , i have had mine since september . i absolutely love it . 
it has a large cotton cover pad that goes all the way around the mattress . cheers 
not over 25 lbs . i was able to lift the box it came in by myself and i 'm 5'2 130lbs 
if you are talking about putting the topper on top of your padding that is built into your mattress , like a comfort top , then absolutely no problem . if you 're talking about putting it on top of another piece of padding that might slip , i 'm not so sure about that because this padding does move around some ... very little but definitely a little bit . as for the sheet , the deep mattress sheets will fit very comfortably over this mattress topper . if you put it over topper and padding , it should still fit , but , of course , i 'm sure it would be a very tight fit . incidently , the topper is awesome ! ! my daughter had a very hard , uncomfortable mattress ... .brand new and harder than she thought it was going to be . it has completely alleviated the problem and i find her very bed very comfortable and i like the soft bed . enjoy ! ! 
the top layer can be washed in a machine and the gel foam does need cleaning unless you spill something and then you just rinse it out in your shower and hang to dry . very easy ! 
not at all : ) 
no , they are 2 separate pieces that do not connect together . 
i would say yes it does at least in the sense that it does not make you hot at all . i found that my older memory foam pillows made my head sweat only . i changed to the microbead pillows and that is no longer a problem now . 
yes , i 've used it without the fiber filled cover . you may want to get a mattress protector to cover the foam so it does n't soil . 
not sure of the exact dimensions but we have a queen size bed and it fits it perfectly . i thought the dimensions were written on amazon when i purchased it . it 's very comfortable and we are very happy with it . hope this helps a little bit . i recommend it . 
normally 7-15 days to united states , not long time ! please do not worry . 
as a flower , it is roughly 3 '' diameter by 2 '' depth . it depends on how tightly you fold the bag back into it . the bag is roughly 15 1 2 '' wide by 16 1 2 '' deep , not including the handles , which are 1 '' wide and have a loop hang of about 10 '' . to be more precise , i 'd need to iron it and i do n't have time . hope this helps . 
yes , i got 5 bags when i ordered these . 
i 'm sorry but i have not washed the one i have . the others i gave to friends . 
i am not sure but i think its woven nylon , they are cute , i will be using them to put hostess gifts for the holidays 
barbara , the stainless steel rack extends from 13 3 4 '' to 21 '' . roomy size fits 12 '' dinner plates and glassware . utensils dry in clear acrylic basket . measures 5 '' high , 11 3 4 '' wide . we hope this will be of help to you . 
dear william , the size of the over the sink dish drainer rack is 5 '' high , 11 3 4 '' wide and extends from 13 3 4 '' to 21 '' long . 
the basket is 14 '' long , 11.5 '' wide and 5 '' deep . the frame of the basket which hangs above the sink is 16 '' minimum and extends to 20.5 '' maximum . 
i 'm not sure . i do n't think that the product is made in china ; i believe that it was made in the us . to be frank , i try to avoid products made in china . the sink has worked out well for me , as it 's adjustable . no rust . it was what i needed to organize my kitchen better and to break myself of the habit of leaving items in the dish tray too long . hope that this helps . 
i 've had mine about 8 months and it has not rusted . i do n't know if it can go in the dishwasher , have just wiped mine down . 
dear cindy thompson , thank you for your recent inquiry . the over the sink dish drainer rack is stainless steel . we hope this information has been helpful . 
dear cindy thompson , thank you for your recent inquiry . you are correct , the width will remain at 11 3 4 '' while the length extends from 13 3 4 '' to 21 '' . 
the longest side is the `` length '' and is also the side that expands to cover the gap to the sinks edge . therefore , the width is the shortest side ... ... . 
basket is about 11.5 x 13.5. it extends to fit 20 in sink opening 
as stated in the item description , the stainless steel rack extends from 13 3 4 '' to 21 '' . roomy size fits 12 '' dinner plates and glassware . utensils dry in clear acrylic basket . measures 5 '' high , 11 3 4 '' wide . we hope this will be of help to you . 
19 '' x 30 '' i have one . 
i guess about 15 x18 . it is pretty but slips all over the place . needs some kind of grip stuff underneath 
it is machine wash & tumble dry . i do n't know how well it will fare however . it 's a pretty rug , but is not holding up well to every day use . 
yes it does . 
the tag says foam made in usa , pillow assembled in usa . 
yes , you can wash and dried in the machine no problem . 
i never noticed any negative smell from them . slight when i first opened . so it should n't last long , i would n't wash them right away as that will wear them out quicker . they truly are the best pillows for me , hope you get to enjoy them 
this pillow is not sold with a travel bag . thank you for your inquiry . 
these pillows are filled with shredded memory foam . in my opinion because of this , it is much more comfortable to sleep on than the solid foam . i have bought several of these pillows , so i have spares , that 's how great they are ! 
i would hope this question is for hotel life who is selling them below our actual cost even before amazon and shipping fees 
about 27 '' long and 16-17 '' wide . 
no . i put them in an empty yogurt tub . 
each mold can hold exactly 4 oz ( 1 2 cup ) of liquid when filled flushed to the top . however , you will need to remove about 4-5 tsp of liquid for the lid to close to keep the liquid in . 
we want to acknowledge that we also received your question through our website . our product is made in china and pass all regulations for safe use . 
the fan shuts off with the compressor . bought this to replace a four year old unit from lowes that ran continuously . this keystone works great , i should have bought it a year ago . it dries the air quickly then cycles on & off as needed . very quiet compared the old one . 
a dehumidifier will produce heat when it is dehumidifying . in the process of changing the state of the moisture in the air from a gas to a liquid , heat must be given up by the moisture . the dehumidifier absorbs this heat and releases it out the back . in general 1,000 btu 's are released for every pound of water that is made from the dehum process . 
yes it does . it comes with a kit to install a hose directly to the unit . i have n't installed mine yet but soon will be . this unit has been treated me great . i recomend buying it . 
you may wish to check the specifications , but the size of the room will also depend on the humidity the unit must remove . we have ours in a large unfinished basement area , and it is doing the job quite well . my assessement from a lay perspective is that it will handle a large room or small one-floor apartment nicely . it wo n't handle a house . i would be overkill for a typical sized-bedroom or bathroom alone . 
it has a full one-year parts and labor warranty and a limited 5-year sealed system warranty as well . 
we use it in a lage storage building that lately has been around 40 degrees , no freezing yet . 
yes it can . it is a bit deceiving but when you press where it says `` timer '' it activates the timer , when you press either of the arrows that changes your desired humidity setting up or down . 
according to the manual , working condition is 41 to 95 degrees . 
when the bucket fills the machine will automatically shut off until the water is dumped out and the float drops . to set the humidity level turn off continuous mode the press the up down arrows until the led readout is at the desired humidity level . 
install the diverter tubing that connects the outflow ( that would go into the bucket ) to the internal connection leading to the drain hole . if you do n't have a manual , download from the manufacturer 's site . 
it should with a little extra space since most dakimakura covers are for 150cm or more and this pillow is 137cm in length 
i have n't found it supportive enough for neck and shoulder pain , but i do lay on the entire pillow for side sleeping 
i would say a good combination of firm and medium . it 's not too firm where you feel like you 're snuggling a hard memory foam pillow , but it 's not too soft where if you throw your leg over it that it squishes down to nothing . i bought because of spinal surgery . i would suggest to get a cover for it because it is not a soft feeling case it 's in . 
it has held for me and i have had it several months . i got it because i am pregnant and it helps to keep me comfortable when sleeping . 
the box is slightly larger than the pillow . it does not smoosh or crush the pillow at all . you could fit a small human being in it , but probably should n't . 
no 
hello patty , the pillow does not come with a cover . 
it 's more on the firm side . it holds it shape well and supports great . i sleep on my side so this pillow is plush enough for comfort but firm enough to support . temp wise , it is more on the hot side . i would suggest buying a cool temp fabric cover for it . 
not firm , but fluffy 
i think they are medium firm and they do keep their shape 
two pillows 
yes , it can . i personally have a rod they attach to but it can also attach to the wire . 
you should be able to . the rod is not attached to the vertical bars when you receive it . so it could be cut before assembly if you have tools for that . 
yes it can

yes 
this clamps onto your closet rod and it takes up 26 '' . i hope this helps . i love them . i have two !

it is quite sturdy . i own 2 of these . most of your close hang on the actual closet rod itself . only the lower rod on the closet rod organizer can hold many pairs of pant or skirts . i currently have 26 pairs of pants hanging from this rod . i would definitely recommend and if i needed more of these , i would n't hesitate to purchase more . 
no filter needed . that is to say , the wine aerator does not use a filter . 
it is easy to rinse with water or you can put it in the dishwasher . the main problem is that residual wine will drip from the aerator into the holding cup , so you have to clean everything after each use . 
really enhanced my merlot . 
the aerator is made of acrylic . 
hi jing , without any significant problem is not residuios that may change caracterticas varietal . best regards fabian 
china . 
both have the same 3 stage process for aeration . umbrella , tiny holes and then the suction tube . from an engineering standpoint they appear to be the same . i have the zazzol and love it ! i use it for reds , whites and spirits . i 'd go with best price between those two 
injecting air ( oxygen ) into wine improves its flavour . this aerator does a good job . it can also be used for individual glasses . you can get a similar response by decanting the wine so that you have turbulent rather than laminar flow going into the decanter . slow down for the last portion of the bottle to avoid sediments flowing into the decanted wine . 
i compared the zazzol with pictures of the vinluxe on amazon and both seem identical . since the vinluxe is not available , the zazzol would be a fine replacement . and i do mean fine . cheers . 
which opening are you referring to ? where you pour the wine in or where the wine comes out ? inside diameter where you pour the wine in is 2 inches ( a little less ) . other end is approx 7 16 of an inch . 
i just measured with a ruler and they are actually 1 3 4 '' square , not 2 '' square . 
yes - i did n't know that was an indication of fillers in the silicone . 
hello i measured it for you . each cube will hold 3.5 oz giving a little room for the freeze expansion . 
they 're made of silicone , not sure about if they 're `` professional grade '' but we havent had any problems with them . 
since they 're silicone , you should be able to bake in them . they would need support since they 're quite flexible . have n't tried it myself . do n't have any paper work to check cautions . why do n't you contact seller ? 
the design does n't allow for stacking . also , the mold is designed to be pliable so that you can push out each cube individually . so stacking a mold on top of another mold while the contents are still liquid could cause the sides of the mold to bend a little and would not yield perfect cubes . i 'd say this type of mold is perfect for someone who plans on using it for the home to make a few cocktails , but would not be ideal if you 're looking to make a lot of giant cubes for a larger social gathering . 
it says bpa free in the descriptor , but i have not double checked them . 
none that i know of . we constantly refill and freeze 
no need for square glasses . most on the rocks glasses work fine . 
yes , but they rinse out easily . 
nope- it is fantastic- i bought 2 and washed them a gazillion times - best blanket , ever . 
no 
one 1 
this is a big blanket which will easily fit a regular king or california king . 
with a.c. plus a cotton sheet underneath , possible ! with just fan ... no way ! 
yes , no problem . ample fabric to cover modern , thick mattresses . nice quality too 
no , i purchased one . 
these are microfiber sheets . so i do n't think there is a thread count . 
according to package directions , you are to spot clean only . do not put in washer or dryer . do not immerse in water . 
i ordered this blanket almost a year ago for my 9 yr old granddaughter . i had doubts that the lights would work well much last for long . to my amazement , it is still working beautifully a year later . she loves it and uses it lots in winter and even in summer for fun in the dark . it is white and she is careful to keep it clean . spills can be wiped off with damp cloth . a great investment that made a sweet little girl very happy . 
yes they do 
i have no idea . a gift for 10 yr old granddaughter she loves it ; has had it for 6 mis and lights still working 
no , it is a child size blanket . my granddaughter 's blanket failed right after amazon 's return period ran out , so my granddaughter is now without her blanket . 
neither , thereis electrical wiring indide 
the kettle is about 14 '' in diameter , and about 14 '' tall . 
stainless steel normally wo n't work on induction plate since it has no iron bottom core . 
i use a bayou classic high pressure cooker , which is a pretty diesel burner . i have had no issues with residual heat- especially because of the welded fitting . i have been using it for the past 6 months or so , a couple times a month , without a problem . i do not even think there are any heat marks on the bottom of the pot- good quality . 
no 
as the other person said , probably but dont need one . when i brew , i just use a sheer curtain which helps act as a sediment filter and makes grain disposal a breeze . 
they are definitely welded on , you have to screw on the ball valve and temperature gage , if you use silicon tape it works great 
no , simply stainless steel , no multiple layers or walls , or cores . nice though 
it comfortably holds service for eight -- eight each of knives , dinner forks , salad forks , soup spoons and teaspoons . 
it does n't say anything specific about rusting . however , the finish seems like a thick coating so , i do n't think its stainless steel , or any similar material that might rust . that 's a guess on my part . i will say , it is nicer in person than the picture portrays . 
no . 
there are three . i like mine . i live in a small nyc apartmen and it 's perfect for my purposes : ) 
i 've used it for months in my dish drainer . clean , wet utensils go in it to dry . it 's fine and has n't rusted . sorry for the delayed response . i had n't been checking all my emails . 
yes it will hold all flatware and spatulas . not enough room for both . and if you are in a hurry like me . the flatware slips in between the openings on the side and bottom . beautiful crafted .look for one that is closed in on sides and bottom . if they would make the sides and bottom openings closer this would work . my rating 2 1 2 . 
8 '' long 2 3 4 '' wide 4 3 4 '' high 
yes 
mine has four sections . i really like mine . 
this is a lot smaller than what you might think it is . i would have purchased two . here are the dimensions : across the front it 's roughly 7 1 2 inches . the height is approximately 4 1 2 inches and the depth is 2 1 2 inches . hope this helps . 
if you are referring to a inside door that separates rooms , then i would say `` no . '' if you are referring to a kitchen cabinet door , then i would say `` maybe . '' the inner dimension of the hook is about 5 8 '' . finally , you would not be able to close the door properly even if the hook did go over the door . i hope this response was helpful . 
i think they would work ... you might need to adjust the shape of the curve that 's going over the door louvers a bit , but a large pliers or a vise and hammer should do the trick . good luck ! 
the hook can easily carry the weight of your skillet . is your bar attached to the wall securely ? you 're more likely to have a problem with the bar pulling away from the wall if you have a lot of weight on it . 
4 1 2 '' long by 1 1 2 '' wide 
did n't measure but i 'll say 3 16 
looks like about 5 8 '' 
no . i do not think that others who have said yes understand your question . there may be other hooks that would fit . but these hooks measure less than one inch in the curve , and would not go over a 1 '' rod . 
i would n't . too light . they would end up in the punch , i suspect . and they look more industrial than decorative . 
these are pretty sturdy 
no they will not fit . i bought these for a 1 inch road and it would n't fit . robert lies 
yes it does . that 's the machine i have . keeps coffee close and ready for action 
no , you ca n't , but is so beautiful by himself ! ! 
i do n't know exactly , i purchased it for my pixie and wanted a bit of extra room on top to hold my coffee and aeroccino if desired . i simply compared the dimensions of each item to make sure it would fit . i can tell you this : this is a wonderfully substantial piece , with tempered glass of a decent thickness- not thin nor shoddy at all . i was quite pleasantly surprised , and it came well packaged ... and from an artists perspective ... esthetically pleasing ! 
yes . i have the latissima and there is enough room to store some cups on the glass platform as well . 
15x3x13 . i have the least expensive model of the nespresso . i have that on top plus the frother , plus espresso cups along with 2 small containers of sweetner . it all fits fine on the top . it 's very nice ! 
nespresso capsules are 1-7 16 diameter at the top ( they nest upsidedown in a depression that is made for their size ) and they are 1-1 4 '' tall . there is also a liner in the drawer ( black flocked plastic ) that can easily be removed . the inside of the drawer measures 10-3 4 '' x 12-7 8 '' with a drawer depth of 1-1 4 '' hope this helps ! 
1 ) the sizes are the following : length 35 cm , width - 37 cm , height - 6 cm . 2 ) my machine 's weight is 6.0 kg and i am sure the storage can hold 2-3 kgs more . the stands of it are very solid and the top glass is thick enough . 
it is fairly sturdy , about 2.5 times the width of the nespresso machine that i have sitting on it . 
actually i do n't know . ..it looks great and heavy i gifted to my brother . 
black powdered coated steel i imagine looking at it . i love the unit 
across the top the basket is 10 1 4 x 7 1 8 `` the bottom is 9 x 5 `` the basket is 5 1 2 '' tall . it is sturdily built . margaret 
7 inches x 10 inches x 5.75 inches deep 
i only have one . but being the bottom is narrower than the top i would say no . 
no . i do n't recommend using it for cleaning products . i bought them for my kids to play `` kitchen '' with play food . they are rather small and not sturdy with low handles . hope that helps 
i have not had it in or near water . i just love the basket though . i could use more of them . 
about 18 '' -- we sent it back because the hooks it hangs by only work on thin or standard doors , and we had a thicker door . 
17 inches 
i found it to be made well , have n't had any issues . 
how thick ? i have it over a standard door , so it 's hard to say . prob maximum of 2.5 '' . 
i do n't have any measurements but it fits perfectly on the inside of my coat closet door which is a regular standard wooden door . 
yes , they are . they are twice as wide as the ones on the top . they can hold purses or clutches . 
no , the back is cloth 
i actually do n't use mine for shoes . sorry . i bought this for my pantry to organize my gravy and seasoning packets

since i bought this dresser is useless for me because i had to pay to someone to assemble it but every drawer came off little by little . 
i did not measure the box , we received it in january and it fit in the back of my mazda 3 hatch back with the back seat down . hope that helps . mz 
it is very sturdy and looks good . i was very pleased , it is far from cheap quality . do n't cancel 
thanks for your question ! according to the product details the dimensions of this item are 19 x 31.5 x 45 inches . the price varies depending on which seller you choose to purchase from . here is a list of all the sellers that are currently selling this item : 
they are 171 2 inches front to back inside 
the plate with the two huge holes is for sausage stuffing . the rest are just different sizes , and can be used for whatever , mostly . the one with 5 holes does a more `` chili grind '' that gives you larger chunks that are perfect for a chunky chili , where as the smaller plate does a `` hamburger grind '' thats perfect for like taco meat or sloppy joes ... its just a little bigger than the small grind that came with your meat grinder unit . the one that came with your unit is a very fine hamburger grind , thats great for hamburgers or meatballs ... but mostly . the only difference between the rest of the plates is how fine course your meat will come out , and thats a personal preference rather than anything that 's set . i suggest grinding about 1 4lbs with each plate , cook them seperately , and see what you like the best and what you think will work for you . i like using the one that came with the set with the 6 holes for ground chicken ! its nice , because it dooes n't make chicken mush like the stuff i get at the store ! 
i would try contacting butcher baker through the customer service link here . they might be able to steer you in the right direction . i will say that the attachments are far superior to the kitchenaid provided cutters in cutting ability and versatility so it is worth searching a set that will fit . 
yes 
this set of cutters is for the kitchenaid grinder attachment that connects to your kitchenaid stand mixer 
thats about how long ago i got mine and it works fine.at first i didnt think it would work because when i put it togather i could n't turn it by hand but then attached it to my mixer and it worked fine . it dose a lot better then the ones that come with the grinder . hppe this helps . 
the four grinding plates in this set are all different from the original plates that come with the grinder attachment . 
no , i have n't noticed any metallic residues . i have used my grinder attachment many times since purchasing it . 
i never tryed to grind poltry bones , it can damage the sharp of the blades , if you are gon na grind bones i recomend to cook bones previously until them become smoth ! ! good luck buddy ! : ) 
they are about 16 inches , same as an adult hanger . 
i have hung several of my wet tank tops with no bleed through . i have not tried white , but i think there should be no problem with it either . 
10 each i a pack n i purchased 5 packs at least ... .i love them ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
did n't read the label . but the quality is awesome . 
hello , thank you for your question . the good news is that we are launching our new 'purple orchid ' range very shortly . they are a beautiful , elegant deep purple color . there should be some available within the next 2 weeks . regards customer service team living concept 
snow cone has a three to five year shelf life . no refrigeration needed . one of the most shelf stable items you can purchase . 
it is ready to use . just need ice and cups 
no you will need to order one 
you usually only put about and ounce and a half of syrup to a 6 ounce cone ... ..a gallon is 144 ounces ... you can figure that you can get from 70 to 100 per gallon of flavoring ... .dont water it down ... .it will ruin the flavor 
depending on how big the cups are . 
no they are not sugar free ... ..i too do not like sugar free and these definitely are not ! 
no nuts , no eggs . 
i have never put mine in the microwave , but if you take the top off and the strainer out it is all glass . so i can not see why it would not be ok in the microwave . it is easy enough to put the strainer in after the water is heated if you do not fill it too full . 
i do n't know . i have n't needed one yet . 
yes , unfortunately the lid is plastic . there are no markings on the lid either to identify which type of plastic it is . i do not suggest putting the lid in the dishwasher , and wash with mild soap . there is only a small part of the lid that actually touches the liquid , but it does not make constant contact with the lid , unless the contents are stored upside down . hope that helps . 
it does not . the cap unscrews and completely comes off and you drink as if from an ordinary cup . 
without the strainer or the cap it should be microwave safe . my bf has microwaved his but i 'm hesitant because i worry about the air gas pocket between the layers of glass . long story short it should be fine but a hot water kettle would be a better alternative than microwaving the water and just about as quick . 
metal . 
yes . 
it can be washed , just wash it in cold , on the delicate setting by itself . i hang mine dry . this pillowcase is really cute and worth the price , i 'm very pleased with mine . : ) 
we will ship it in 1 business day after the payment is clear , at the same time , we will ship it via ems , it will take 5-15 days to arrive at you.thanks . 
hello dear friend , thank you for your interest in our item , but i am so sorry that we do n't have it in 24x24 the moment . hope to do nice business with you next time~best regards 
yes , it is . 
no just on one side . my husband says it looks like the ct lottery logo . that kind of ruined my delight . 
todava no los he lavado 
you will have to ask the seller about why the full size is more expensive than the queen size . a my full size bed is 5475. a queen is 6080. your bed is 5476. i personally went with a full size even though it irked me that is was more expensive than the queen . i 'm very pleased with mine . 
unfortunately it does . 
personally , i used right away . did n't have a problem at all . 
i do n't have any back issues with this topper . 
it 's pretty soft once you 're laying on it . it feels like a giant marshmallow in my opinion , which is great for my back 
to be honest i never paid it any attention . i was more focused on the softness 
i believe it 's 100 % memory foam 
here it is : 20 '' x 20 '' x 10-1 2 '' , ... and maybe bulging a little . bruce 
i have n't found it to be hot when i sleep on it . 
i do n't see why not . try an elc knife or press down with a borad an a razor knife on top of something that wount cut 
not really and i live in az i know heat . lol . 
these will last anywhere from 10 to 20 years and very rarely have any issues . there is a 3 year warranty from the manufacturer as well . 
we recommend you do not use either electric blankets or heating pads with our memory foam toppers . the memory foam material responds to your body temperature , and the additional heat from electric blankets or heating pads causes the mattress to respond to that heat instead of conforming to your body . longer periods of exposure to the heat from electric blankets or heating pads may damage the memory foam material . 
this topper arrived tightly compressed and rolled double-folded in a box about 30 '' x24 '' x18 '' ( i 'm guesstimating here from my recollection ) . the package weighed about 20-25 lbs . easy for one person to handle . 
yes ! ! of course ! but just in casa and to avoid it to get off easy , you could buy `` sheet suspenders '' . i have it on every bed in my house . 
it is unlikely a normally-operating electric blanket will melt this topper , as the foam reflects traps enough heat that the temperature control will kick in as if a person were under the blanket . i would not recommend an electric blanket , however , as the viscose foam sleeps very warm . you will find that more than your own body heat ( except in unusually cold conditions ) may be warmer than you prefer . 
yes ; the flexibility of the foam and the fact that it is only 2.5 '' thick make it appropriate for folding into a sofa bed . i would not recommend that it be the only mattress on the bed , however . 
no cover came with this product . i wish it did ! ! 
i would say yes but if you had s good sheet set with form fitting bottom sheet it might be enough . 
we have a 2 '' on our couch hide a bed and can still feel the support bar ... .so i would say at least the 3 '' . as far as full or queen.. i guess that would depend on the width of your cot . hope that helps at least a little ! 
no it does n't come with a cover but fits nicely into most mattress covers . 
i have a queen size bed 
would n't be easy as its vacuum sealed when shipped . you could fold it but it would n't be small . 
i am sorry , but i purchased the queen size memory foam mattress cover . i do not know the weight . 
the twin xl is for dorm room beds 
i order the full size not the twin xl , i 'm sorry i could not help you . 
no , but you do n't really need one . just put it on your bed and put the sheets over it and it 's fine 
the one i purchased covered the bed completely 
ours has sunk , leaving a mountain in the middle . wo n't be buying a second one . 
very comfortable for me ! love it and would buy it again . 
fairly dense but it is more comfortable than just the firm mattress we have . 
we 've only had it a couple of months and seems fine . it will shift on bed a little but i need a new mattress protector which goes over gel topper . and my spouse and i are not small people . i 've been happy with it as has my lower back . 
it 's plenty firm for us . we put it in our travel trailer however been thinking about trading it out for the one on the bed in house because it is so very comfortable . luv this topper , best one we 've had 
just the foam 
it 's pretty dense . cumbersome to put on the bed by yourself ; pretty easy with 2 people though . not sure of exact weight . 
no , not that i know of 
the only description given is 3 '' thick . 
so far no but it has been cold here . now in the middle of summer it might be a different story . 
no idea . 
it came in a box about 2'x3 ' , which then it was in plastic . so my guess would be that you would have to take it out of the box then place in a large suitcase . it squishes pretty good then goes right back into shape . hope that answers your question . 
the diminsions are 3 '' thick 3'x6 ' for a twin matress give alittle . i hope that helps . 
i 'm unsure i ordered a full size 
no 
the smaller one . 
i do n't believe there is . i 've had it for several months now and it still works great ! 
if you need something firm i would not recommend any memory foam . memory foam it is by nature not firm , but the opposite , it molds to your shape . sounds like a spring-based mattress would be more appropriate for you . 
it was big enough for my 5yr old to play in it comfortably ! lol . i 'd guess about 3'x3'x2 ' . it 's been thrown away , so i ca n't give exact measurements . the foam itself was folded and vacuum packed in plastic . probably about 2'x2 ' . 
it did smell a little after i took it out of the box . i did not put it on my bed for several days . the smell was gone by then . 
this one is two inches thick- they lump all the reviews together which is really confusing and not really useful . i personally love my 2 inch topper- we have a baby and now we sleep like we have n't slept in ages . i have a queen , but it fits perfectly on top of the mattress , so i would assume the king does as well 
i would not suggest to do that . it is very dense . i 'm afraid it would lose its texture . 
80x60 standard queen size 
the pillowtop on my mattress was dilapidated too . i put a fitted sheet over the mattress and pillowtop , placed the foam over sheet and then another fitted sheet over the foam and mattress . feels like a bit much at first , but now i love it . 
i do not know the answer to your question . andrew . i would ask the seller if i were you . they were most responsive when i had an issue with their product . 
it came vacuum sealed in a box about 2.5x2.5x1 ft and weighed about 25lbs . it was very manageable . 
the best i can tell you is im 5'3 and 160lb and my bf is 6'3 and 260lb plus or minus and i do not roll to the middle , hope that kinda of helps . also i can get out of bed for a few minutes and my indentation is already gone . 
i would reccomend getting a vacuum saver bag if thats the case . it doesnt fold up very small , but the vacuum saver bag should compress it down for easy storage . just remember to give it a few hours to reexpand before using 
less than 6 hours . i just opened it up in a room not being used . let it fully expand while kids were at school . it was ready before they got home . no bad odor and worked out great ! 
no , but i place it directly on top of the mattress and under the mattress pad . love it ! 
no . it rolls out and stays rolled out . i have never had an issue with that . 
i 've never slept on any other memory foam so i have nothing to compare it to . but it does seem cooler than my bed was before the topper . hope that helps ! 
its not cooling . but i have no problems waking up warm since i bought it . 
i think it would be fine . mine came to me shipped in a square that was vacuum packed . i was worried it would have creases but it once i pulled it out and put it on my bed they went away like magic . i think it will work great on an adjustable bed . 
39x75 which is the standard for a twin mattress 
nope . just the foam . 
ask the company you are getting it from 
i ca n't say for sure , but with this foam not having a cloth cover , it stays in one place much better than those with a cover ( a prior experience ) , ... so my guess is that it would stay where you put it . if not , you could purchase the thin , non-skid , flexible meshes , often used under small scatter rugs , and the foam would more than likely , stay in one place . 
we have no idea . we bought a queen size . 
i do n't think so . i put the foam on right away ... only leaving it until that night to sleep on . the odor was slight..at least to me . i did not receive any instructions on waiting . 
typically the pitcher is on the mound , but in the event of a ground ball to the right side of the field , the pitcher will generally cover 1st . the runner has right of way and can try to gently bump the pitcher off the base and dislodge the ball . 
do you have the diamond vortex ? mine does all of this and makes great smoothies and juicing 
it has .9 hp . i believe it is a little less than 700 watts . please see this review : http : www.popularmechanics.com technology gadgets tests 4332328 
it does crush ice well but works best with a little liquid 
this is the information i have . * 120 volts , 6 amps , 60 hz * capacity : 60-oz . pitcher * weight : 9-lb. , 6-oz . * cord : 44 '' l * assembled in the usa * 1-year manufacturer replacement warranty 
i believe it has to do with the fact that the bad is a professional style as well as the blender container is made of a shatter and crackpot plastic as well as stain resistant . ... motor is quite ... .works like a vitamin blender but it 's a bit bigger ... ..i use vitamin at work ( i 'm a chef ) and i have this at home and it works the same ... .i love it 
it did n't show where it made from..but it tells 'assembled in usa ' on the label . 
yes i can , and do for healthy smoothies , with fruit , almond milk , kale and bananas . 
can not taste or feel the seeds on strawberries or even apples . even raw , dry oatmeal disappears . no worries . 
i believe you can . it 's one piece and it 's plastic . i would do top shelf . 
550 watt thanks 
the pitcher holds 8 cups . it 's comparable to other blender pitchers , but the blade and bottom are attached as all one piece , so there 's no leaking ! 
this is made for usa and is 110v 
hi , it does n't fit under my cabinet with the lid on it but does without the lid . 
my wife says , '' i suppose it could ? '' we have never tried and i do n't want to say yes , without knowing for sure . sorry 
nope ... lid holds very tight ... .the center cap holds tight but seems as if there is enough roo . to allow steam to pass so pressure does n't buold up 
hi . they do n't make it . the only one with glass pitcher is model number ksb565er which i have some left . thank you 
i think you might be looking for the coffee grinder that the manufacturer sell because this unit is for blending fruits and making smoothies . thanks 
yes . anything kitchenaid is american made . see here : http : www.huffingtonpost.com 2012 07 07 american-made-products_n_1656135.html 
after using old and new version here is my conclusion : the old version was good ; loud , strong vibrations , easy to use and small . but it had its issues the battery cover would frequently fall off and the belt clip would break off too easily when it was in your gym bag or if you knocked it while exercising . thankfully the new version seems to have addressed these problems . they have made it so the belt clip is removable so it wo n't break in your gym bag and having looked at the clip itself it seems more solid so it seems like this will be much more hard wearing . been using the new model for about 2 months 6 days a week and no issues . hope that helps 
yes it will . i own a gym - mine is used continuously ! if there is a period of inactivity for over a minute it turns itself off to save the battery life . i love mine and so glad i got it . it 's very handy ! 
yes just set it to `` v '' or you can do a combo like on the picture `` bhv '' is beep high + vibrate . 
nope . you should invest in a garmin watch : ) . this just does straight intervals . you could time the 5 min warm up and cool down on your own . . . then use this for the 7:2 's . 
i think it probably would , i 'm not sure . if i were you i 'd rather clip it to the waistline of my pants or shorts , or even underwear for that matter ... . 
if you are using the interval timer mode , it 's easy to pause right in the middle of your workout - just press the start button ( on the left side of the gadget ) three times , and press again to restart . 
i 'm not sure i completely understand what you 're asking . but you can definitely do anything like that with a gymboss minimax , which has more capability for a few dollars more . this is the basic gymboss which i understand is more limited in functionality . i have the minimax . 
yes it can . 
i have n't dropped it in water or near water to see , but from my experience of using it i find it to be water resistant but probably not waterproof . 
metrokane who also makes the `` rabbit `` wine opener , makes a very nice but expensive wine decanter . this wine aerator is one of the easiest and cheapest to use . just place it in the bottle after you have opened it and pour through it when you pour glasses of wine and when you are finished , it is very easy to clean under the faucet . it also fits in the drawer because it is n't very big . i think it works very well and i would recommend this wine aerator to anyone . 
i have n't tried it on that size but since it is tapered i assume it would fit . you can find out for sure from susan at `` b.h.p . - amazon marketplace '' & lt ; ykd4q917s5h4pp9 @ marketplace.amazon.com & gt ; they have been great - one of the best online retailers i have ever dealt with ! 
not sure , the wine i had did n't have any sediment . however , the bubbles after the aeration were very fine , so it is logical to assume that some particles may be filtered out , especially larger ones . 
it is made of a very thick plastic to ensure it doesnt break very easy ! 
it is acrylic , so no need to worry about it breaking 
i do n't know . perhaps you should ask the seller ?

i measured from front to back including the extension of the case in the back of the unit which exceeds the front to back measurements from each side and it is exactly 19 '' deep . the 110 volt electrical connection where it enters the machine is also within this 19 '' dimension . hope this helps 
yes . it comes on when you open the door and when in use . 
i took a quick measurement ~ 2 '' 
yes you can . see instruction manual page 12 . 
does it defrost meat evenly don , t no have not had it that long i have never seen a microwave defrost meat evenly . any of them . 
i had it up against a large cutting board next to my refrigerator and i had no issues . i did keep the side with the venting open and clear , which is on the left side if you are looking at the front of it . 
all of the latches have a screw on the side of the machine that holds the outer cover . the bottem screw on the right can be tightened too much making it difficult to close the door without making a loud snapping noise . there are two ways to solve the problem . the first is to loosen the screw about a half turn and the second is to press the release mechanism before closing the door which takes the pressure off of the latch completely as you close the door . care in using the door mechanism solves the problem . if you have difficulty closing or opening the door , loosen the screw until the door opens easily then tighten it a quarter turn . if you adhere to this procedure the door problem is eliminated . it is really a great microwave . 
not sure what the issue was mary but i have n't seen any trouble with mine since i got it . by the way it is the best microwave i have ever had ... love this one ! 
i bought it just in case , but it seems pretty solid out of the box . i probably would not buy warranty if i had the chance to do it again 
punch in 349 and hit start 
the default beep mode is on . press start once . press timer clock once . press start once . press timer clock once and that should turn off the beep . check page 14 of the manual or this link . http : www.manualslib.com manual 550707 panasonic-nnsn773s.html ? page=14 # manual 
yes , when you open the door , the light goes on . it goes off when you close it . it turns back on when you start the cooking process . 
the top and sides are stainless colored , but not actually stainless steel . they look more like the platinum ( non-fingerprinting ) metal that they put on some fridges . it looks really sharp . 
in traditional microwave ovens , cooking power is controlled by cycling energy to an internal device called a magnetron . magnetrons can only deliver a full burst of energy , so when you set your microwave to low , the magnetron is turned off part of the time and on part of the time . inverter microwaves allow for fine-tuned control of the heat for a constant steady cooking temperature , and this helps them work more effectively . read more : http : www.ehow.com facts_6818200_inverter-microwave_.html 
hi r.l. , this unit is a very good microwave oven , but does not have the convection feature [ we have a 2nd microwave , from dacor , that has this feature . the convection feature would be labeled on the operation panel if it was built in to this unit ; i did extensive research on this panasonic before my purchase to verify that it was not a convection oven ] . as far as using anything with aluminum , the owners manual states that you may only use small strips of foil to mold around thin parts of meat or poultry to prevent overcooking , with a chance for arcing if the foil is too close to the oven wall . using this info , i would have to say no to your question about using a 9x13 disposable pan . hope this helps . 
it does have a countdown timer function . 
yes , pretty much . you can press 4:00 and `` start '' and it will run for four minutes on full power . the best feature of this oven is the `` inverter '' technology , however , which lets you set a power level , 1-10 , and actually delivers that level of microwave power , as opposed to a normal microwave that , say , on power level 5 runs on full power for 10 seconds , then no power for 10 seconds . it really makes a difference . 
it is a very quiet one . heats very well and even . 
yes 
i just had a similar panasonic model which i bought from amazon also . it was large like this one , and it was 1200 watts . mine lasted for 4 years and 4 months . thoroughly loved the way it worked ! also owned a panasonic before that one , although i do n't remember how long it lasted . 
each wonder hanger has 5 slots in it . there are 20 wonder hangers , so if you only hang one clothing hanger per slot then you could hang 100 hangers . 
yes they are white . 
mine were sent in shrink wrapped bundles of 10 . 
for shirts yes , for pants , coats not at all . if you need it for pants get the metal . but works great for shirts and light stuff 
very durable . pretty sure it is plastic . i have a lot of stuff on it and i do n't want to take all of it off to check . i currently have 2 sets of ceramic kitchen canisters on it . they are full of flour , corn starch , sugar , etc . so that is 6 or more ceramic containers , plus what is in them and it turns easily , every time . 
it is made out of 4 triangular shaped pieces of wood . it is made in china and the quality of the wood is deffinately not a good grade . the top is a cherry color stain and very dark in color . it is made well and fits my need for a lazy susan 
probably 14 inches 
thank you for the inquiry . it is a wood with veneer top . please let me know if you have any questions . thanks and have a great day . sincerley , melissa ward 
no bending as the metal is pretty thick . i would n't consider the forks sharp , but they do everything they need to do . have been using this set for a year now and it 's very durable and well made . best set i have ever owned . 
no , but it does have barenthal stamped on it 
4 prongs . i highly recommend them . i would buy another set but i doubt i will need to anytime soon . very well made . 
it is definitely 18 10. it says so on the back of each piece ... .and it has a really nice weight . 
on the box it 's says it designed in france . i looked all over the box and on the flatware itself and it does not say `` made in ... '' anywhere . on the back of the box it talks about how the flatware bares the symbol of barenthal which is a bear logo and the company is located in the east of france . each piece has this symbol . i 'm still not sure if this means it was actually made there , however the flatware has held up great and is a good weight . i do recommend hand washing if you are using it as a special occasion set , hence the dishwasher will dull any set of flatware rather quickly . hope this helps . 
it 's not too deep at all . i 'm not very good with measurements , but would estimate about 1 32 '' maybe ... so far it does n't seem to hold water in the indentions of the pattern that could possibly cause rust . hope that helps ! 
plastic 
they are made of plastic and the grey band around the glass is made of rubber . they do bounce as they have fallen out of the freezer . 
hi craig ! you actually use the same glass for both red and white wines . to get the perfect temperature for red wines , you put the glass in the fridge for about 3-4 hours . for white wines , just leave them in the freezer for 3-4 hours . 
it is thicker than a wine glass at the rim , but i love them . wish i would have got the four glass set . i do n't think you will be disappointed , but that is the beauty of amazon . just send them back if you do n't care for them . 
according to the host website they are bpa free plastic . i did n't see anything in the pamphlet that was enclosed in my box . 
no they are n't . this would normally bother me but not in this case . i love these glasses . 
ours have had no odor . perhaps yours has a small leak of the gel , and should be exchanged . 
yes 
ca n't tell . i checked the packaging and all inserts . also tried finding info on the web , but had no luck . sorry . 
i 've had mine a few months . i wash them and put them right back in the freezer until i need them again . sometimes they are in the freezer for weeks between uses . so far no problems . 
the box says designed in france , i see nothing about china on the box . ( mine is still in the box ) but the fact that it says `` designed in france '' would lead me to believe that is was manufactured somewhere else . it is a nice set , heavy . 
yes , the box said 18 10.i gave this to my daughter for christmas . it was an impressive set.beautiful . 
yes ! and quite lovely so ! the bottom design is repeated on the flip side and the stripes coming down are halved on the back , meaning there are about half as many stripes on the back . it is balanced and the pieces feel good in the hand . 
not overly heavy . substantial and nicely balanced . classic bistro with flair . 
yes 
no you cant . 
17 '' h x 16 '' w x 16 '' d. amazon does not use an amazon box for shipping . it is shipped in a breville corrugated box . 
generally pods can be used with espresso machines if there is an appropriate and associated pod filter . the bes870xl barista express does not come with a pod filter . it is highly recommended that pods not be used on this espresso machine . 
not likely ... . this machine is almost perfect for home use , but not that suitable for commercial use , even if its a small coffee shop . you will need a faster machine , specially when frothing milk ... this machine is reliable but definitely slow for commercial use , so you might find yourself delaying the coffee orders because you would not be able to deliver them on time . additionally , i dont think this machine would stand the this level of commercial usage for long ... . maybe 1 year max . by the way , 50-100 cups a a day is not that small , i rather say its medium sized coffee shop . go for the known and reliable brands on the market such as rancilio , cimbali , gaggia , etc . they are costly but they well pay themselves in less than a year ... . its a pretty straight forward business , dont go for the cheap ! 
this machine has been great . i use it in my cafe in mexico . its on all day and makes alot of coffee . i did buy a stainless steel frothing so i could make certain espressos . i have a couple of extra of all excersories . they are much cheaper in the states . i also have a themostat to tell me how hot the milk is . 
1. coffee bean hopper redesign 2. more control over brew temperature ( pid ) 3. added hot water dispenser 4. auto shut-off function 5. the bes870xl 's power input is at 1600 watts vs. the 1450 watts in the bes860xl . 6. included a dosing tool called `` razor '' 
the bes870xl barista express is designed to grind beans for espresso . all of the settings on it are usable for espresso depending on the type of roast , the age of the bean , and personal preference . we recommend that you add in beans to the hopper initially and , while it is running , adjust it to the middle setting . from there you can either make the grind finer or coarser depending on the results you receive . 
we use a small . separate grinder for decaf beans . once ground we simply spoon them into the double walled porta filter . works every evening for us . 
no but it makes terrific espresso , and espresso drinks and is fast heating and easy to use and clean . 
i own this item . dimensions given with this product in amazon is correct . 
i have used olive oil , brushed it on the unit and it has been fine . 
hi yvonne j , i just wipe the toaster over with a damp cloth wrung out hot from clean soapy water . wipe it all over , then go with non-soapy cloth . i stick my finger into the shape of the toaster on the inside - it seems to work well . 
i 'm not familiar with oroweat . but i know the schmidt 's king bread fits perfectly within the grid , but i have used oblong sourdoughs and other breads it just goes outside the grid a little but still inside the machine . it 's a great machine . 
plug it in 
you plug it in its on , you unplug it it 's off . this is by far one of the best sandwich makers i have every purchased . ca n't go wrong ! 
you plug it in . the lights change colour when it 's up to temperature - perhaps that is it 's only weakness ? you ca n't leave it unattended .

no 120 
no , only us voltage . but ! it is a wonderful tool . 
yes , assuming you 're not a very large size . i am women 's size 14 , and i can . 
we do not offer personalization of our aprons . 
the neck strap is adjustable from 15 inches to 26 inches . each waist strap measures 42 inches in length . 
7 '' w x 7.5 '' h. large enough to fit two 12oz long neck beers in each . 
no it is not waterproof , but it is n't very absorbent or hold water . 
the strap that goes around the neck is adjustable so that the apron can be adjusted up or down thus raising or lowering the pockets . this apron also washes beautifully with no ironing needed . 
well , it is going to get a bit dirty in the kitchen ! my husband fills it with flour while making christmas cookies . we just toss it in the wash with all the other towels . cleans up great ! it is durable . 
yes there is glue . anytime you see different colored pieces of wood on one board this is your clue that the board is laminated ... i.e . individual pieces glued together to make a bigger piece . look closely and you will see that the entire board is constructed of many smaller pieces . while most manufactures will not tell you what kind of glue is used ( not even boos block ... the very expensive american made boards , ) it is usually epoxy , which when dry is considered harmless and non-toxic . 
9.5 x 13 , 8.5 x 11 , and 8 x 6 ... the middle one the same as a piece of paper . 
13 '' by 9.5 '' 
they do not chip - however depending on the amount of use they could have scratches on them . i have been using bamboo cutting boards like these and they have lasted well over a year without replacing them . when i purchased these boards i also purchased the cutting board oil and treated them prior to using . i have found they hold up much better with the treatments and handwashing ( do not put in dishwasher ) . 
we occasionally wash ours in the dishwasher but never use the drying cycle . heat cycles will accelerate aging and cracking in wood products . 
when i received mine ( may 2014 ) the cutting boards were wrapped up in plastic identical to the first picture shown above , and shipped in an amazon box . 
... they are fine with fruits if you make sure to seal and condition the boards properly . 
food grade mineral oil . i love mine ! ! 
they are very substantial ... 10 16th of an inch ... which is very close to 3 4 of an inch . i am very pleased with them . 
they are pretty light - definitely under a pound each . they do a good job of staying firm since the edges are n't chamfered at all and they tend to get suctioned to the countertop . i have n't had a problem but i am a slow and infrequent chopper . 
does not say ... .the only markings are the `` cup & fork '' symbol that means it 's safe for contact with food . they were packaged 2 different `` shapes '' together in a clear plastic bag that had no markings . mine were shipped from china . 
boil eggs first , peel shell , egg should still be warm . place in mold and run under cold water . uses xl eggs you might want to let them sit a bit before taking them out of mold . 
if you put jello on one side , you will get the shape , like an ice cube holder . if you want the 3d effect , then you can set one side first , then the next and hope that they stick together when you clip the already settled side to the liquid side that 's about to settle ( keeping the second side down , of course ; these are not leak-proof ! ) but the best way would be to keep them open and use them like ice cube holders to get two jello shapes from one mold ... 
yes . but need to do while still hot and use larger eggs and skim excess off with paring knife . 
for usa residents is 2-5 days . 
6 diffrent ! ! and i love them so much : ) 
yes . 
120v-60hz and 1000w . 
you will be able to boil water , make soups , and stews . will take a little longer . still faster than crock pot . valve should only cost about $ 12 . 
the deni 9765 electric pressure cooker does not come with a cookbook . 
yes . 
good question . i do not know . somewhere in the information packet or on cooker should be a phone number try calling it . 
yes , it is a true 6.5 qt . 
no but i got one from amazon n love it and share recipes with my family , , love the camera on my i phone i take pic of recipe n send it to family n friends who have a deni 
*innovative heat , steam and pressure combo makes delicious meals fast *cooks , stews , braises , roasts , simmers , slow-cooks and more *non-stick aluminum cooking pot *self-locking lid prevents opening before food is ready *programmable set-and-forget timer , with up to 8 hr . delay *stay-cool stainless-steel housing *automatic shutoff valve *variable setting cooks , warms , browns , etc . 
i like to help but i gave it as a present . i do n't have the book . 
i put it on a trundle bed ( the top-too deep for the bottom pull out ) . it is the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in ! 
jonah , although it is soft , it would not stay `` folded '' in the seated position . also , because it is memory foam it would compress around the support bars . i would not recommend it for a futon . 
i do n't recall what sort of warranty it has . it has been awhile since i purchased it . i still love it ! 
yes but be careful when removing it , the seam that attaches to the zipper tore on mine . you have to be really careful zipping it up . 
honestly it was ready to go within the hour . most amazing purchase ive ever made . the only complaint i have now is that i sleep too late haha , but really . 
this is strictly just a 10 '' mattress , no base , no foundation with legs . i bought box springs and frame for the under support . 
moderately firm 
they say it does , but the problem is it swells to full size when you open it , and how would you ship it back , it took a couple of weeks but i like it now , it still is hard to get out of , in that you will sink into it and you have to pull yourself out . 
you definitely can use you old box spring . 
40.8 lb 's . it 's vaccumed packed . 
it 's comfortably firm 
yes . i purchased regular queen sized bedding for this mattress and it fits just fine . 
definitely . we originally placed the mattress on top of a platform but it was too low . this mattress works great with a box spring . 
this bed requires a firm surface . it must be on a flat surface or a spring support surface . i would suggest a 1 2 inch sheet of plywood be placed on the metal bed first if there is not consistent support on the entire surface . 
the mattress is rolled up in a thick plastic bag . no box . i would guess it it about 2.5 ft in diameter . 
38x75x10 '' 
79 1 4 in long by 9 1 4 in deep by 5 ft wide 
i 'm not sure where the mattress is made but it has a 25 year warranty . the bamboo mattress protector is very nice and supposedly means no bed bugs . i bought this for my teenage son and have had to use it because my sleep number bed is not giving me the comfort that i need this is a very firm and comfortable mattress . i would buy it again if i had the need . in fact i 'm thinking about getting rid of my sleep number bed and buying this for my room . 
it has a fabric cover . however , i use an additional mattress protector to ensure no skin particles , mites , etc . are able to contact the mattress . 
nope 
probably 2 feet by 4 feet box , pretty bulky and kind of heavy . i could not belive how matress fits inside but it did and rolled out like charm 
i do n't see why not . however , it might develop soft spots rather quickly . i have had one for about a year and it is noticeably softer where i sleep compared to the middle . 
it 's a queen size and it measures 78 '' x 58 '' . i love it . hope this helps . 
it 's longer . 
all components come vaccuum sealed , with no assembly necessary . 
yes 
the top 3 inches of the mattress is memory foam with the remaining 7 inches being high density foam for necessary support . i am 6 foot 1 inch , weigh 245 pounds and sink in maybe 2 inches at the most , i think you will be happy with this mattress ( my wife and i sure am ) . 
china . 
my husband is 260 and works great . 
have washed one 4 or so times and started using the 2nd this week , and both look the same so far , no discolor yet . nice satin-silk feel . 
it 's similar to it , the colors are a little different than the one i have but it 's mostly the same . 
dear customer , our items ship from china and delivery time is usually in 8-20 days under normal condition.there is a faster shipping and it will arrive in 3-8 days.but you need add $ 13 extra shipping cost , if you agree . 
dear customer , our delivery time is in 8-20 days under normal condition .

our items ship from china and it usually will arrive in 8-20 days 
i think that beside glass all of the options contain some chemical , the advantage here is that you do not have to maintain it - oiling etc . and i trust their eco statement : eco friendly : the material in this cutting board is made from fsc certified , 100 % recycled wood composite- preserving our precious hardwood forests . the cutting board does n't emit formaldehyde or voc 's -- so it passes indoor air quality tests and makes this an excellent choice for chemically sensitive individuals . the material in the adventuresome kitchen eco friendly cutting board was originally developed as an eco friendly alternative for kitchen countertops , siding , and skate parks . as a cutting board , this material is incredibly lightweight & durable , and naturally resistant to moisture and mold . 
i have had it for months and the feet are still on . i have only used it in the dishwasher a few times . i was surprised the feet did not come off . i was n't too concerned about having them on though . 
it 's a slick surface , but just like any surface- wood , formica countertop , plastic or stone , you 're going to need to flour it ... the dimensions- as noted in the title are only 10x15- so you 're probably not going to want to roll pie dough on it- but if you 're rolling for pasta- it 's probably going to be fine so long as you flour it properly ... 
it is heat resistant and can be used as hot pad . 
no feet and no grippy service but it has never slid off the counter - i love this thing . 
yes , 4 sticky little round tabs came with it and i applied them . what i objected to was how the knife hitting the board felt to me-i did n't feel comfortable with it but the board is very nice , well made , and if you are used to chopping on a hard surface with now give you 'd like it . the grippy feet kept the board nicely in place on the counter . 
mine was printed . thank you ! 
we have never sold black cutting boards . our cutting boards only come in the natural color you see referenced above . 
the surface is completely non-porous so bacteria etc can not penetrate into the board . i do n't know if there is an antimicrobal agent impregnated into the surface . i do not think so and would not want that in a cutting board any way . the main problem with this board is that it is very slippery and light in weight so it slides on our counter top too much and we need to have a piece of paper towel under it . 
i never used an electric knife . for a regular knife , the board remains very smooth . no particles come loose from the surface . 
a capsule averages .21 to .25 to buy ( buying 100 or 200 at a time ) plus coffee - gourmet coffee at $ 10.99 a pound , you will need approx $ 1.10 to fill 10 capsules - so approx 34 cents per capsule for a gourmet blend . you can fill it cheaper with lesser blends or sale espressos or sky 's the limit if you wish coffee for $ 49 a pound - lol 
joe , this product is no good . the box arrived all broken , some capsules crushed , in the end the coffee is week and tasteless 
they work less than 50 % of the time . i find you have to 'over fill ' them so they get punctured 
unfortunately these are very tampermental , subpar cups , i had trouble with them getting stuck in my citiz , and even when it was good and i tamped pretty strongly , it still came out very weak . i guess you could compare nespresso to apple in the sense that it works great with their own products , but 3rd party products just do n't work well with it . ( it'seems likely intended this way ) . sorry , but i can only suggest you do not buy it again 
you can buy these empty capsules and simply use whatever coffee flavor beans that you choose . just make sure to properly grind the beans correctly . 
it may be too finely ground and too firmly packed , water ca n't flow through capsule and or is clogging between perforations . for more flavor , before inserting into machine , use a pin and create many more pin holes in the seal . with more holes , more circulation of water and stranger coffee . 
well , i looked up umilk and it uses the same nespsresso single serve pods , like my u. so it should work . 
i had a similar problem , to resolve it , i ran the machine without any capsules ( so it is empty ) in order to flush out any particles such as old coffee grounds , then the capsule worked fine with my pixie 
these are not sealed , despite appearances , and not intended for long storage . the plastic part of the capsule is perforated . filled capsules should be put in a sealed container in a fridge and consumed shortly thereafter . 
no , the pod is too small 
overall dimensions : 39 '' l x 35 '' w x 38 '' h seat height : 21 '' seat depth : 22 '' hope this helps . 
not sure . but this chair is not wimpy . it is heavy and very sturdy . 
the chair comes in a large box , but pieces are separated in an airsealed bag . so , yes . you may have to take the pieces out of the box , but they are sealed in plastic so no worries about it getting dirty . we really like our chair . 
22 inches 
the angel set is a polyester blend material . 
you described it well . this is a grey with beige tones . it is a made made fabric and durable . send us an email and we 'll be happy to email you a close up photo of the fabric . 
if ordered from our company it does include the matching ottoman . i believe the listing for $ 279 is for the chair only . randy 
i have had this a c unit about a month , i had no problem connecting it to the back of the unit and the window . i did have to take my time as the first time i did not get the hose properly screwed into the window unit , but once i got it right it has stayed together no problem . the unit works very good . the noise level is minimal , on low or medium i do n't have to turn the tv up , on high i have to turn it up two clicks , not bad at all . i would highly recommend this air conditioner ! ! ! 
yes it is bucketless , have n't had to empty any water or use a bucket . as for the db rating and amps it draws it would not be able to say . 
no , you will just send the moisture back into the basement air . get a real dehumidifier . 
from a $ $ $ perspective , we run ours about 12 hours a day . impact on electric bill is about $ 1 per day . hope this helps . 
the intake port brings outside air into the unit to cool it . blocking it off means you will be using cooled air from the room to cool the unit . also , you will create a negative pressure situation inside the room that will suck warm air into the room from any cracks around windows , doors , outlets , etc . to replace the cooled room air that gets warmed inside the unit and exhausted outside through the exhaust port . i suppose it could be done , but the unit would not be as efficient as it is with the intake and exhaust hoses connected to the outside . 
i 've had my whynter arc-131gd for only two months and used it in may , which was an exceptionally dry month humidity-wise here in the northeast , and june , which was a very rainy , very humid month with temperatures in the upper eighties . personally , i 've never had to empty my ac yet but i 've read numerous other reviewers whose acs have shut down because they 've needed emptied drained ) . from what i 've read and experienced , i understand that acs , which are so oversized for the space that they cycle on and off too frequently , do not stay on long enough to remove the interior humidity properly and is one of the reasons that the humidity in the interior space elevates . since i do not feel comfortable in any air conditioned space that is both cold and clammy and i know that i 'm most comfortable in a room with the humidity in the low to mid forties , i do something that 's probably considered unusual ... i run my dehumidifier along with the ac until any 50 or 60 % humidity drops to my comfort zone . i usually run both the ac and dehumidifier concurrently first thing in the morning for a short time , which then maintains humidity in the low forties range all day . would n't work for everyone but , so far , it 's been a comfortable combination for me . lowering the humidity in the room like i do may be why i have n't had to empty or drain my ac . 
it does have a warranty , but honestly i would just encourage you to steer clear , we 've had this unit for 3 months . it got water all over our carpet this morning . ( despite being level and having both plugs properly inserted and tightened ) . also it occasionally , unpredictably freezes over and becomes very inefficient in that state . we will be pursuing the use of this warranty shortly . be warned , their business hours are not a full work day . 
it is n't clear from the question whether the `` glass door '' is a sliding door or a french door on hinges or whether the window is a double-hung , vertical slider , crank-out casement or awning , all of which present different installation challenges . before purchasing the whynter arc-131gd , i had plenty of questions of my own . to answer them , i first went to the site at www.whynter.com , clicked on the model i was considering , and downloaded the manual so that i knew in advance what questions were answered in the manual , what to ask the experts , and how to prepare for my installation . i also found the customer support , service , and technical staffs at whynter to be particularly knowledgeable and exceptionally helpful . they can be reached by phone at 1-866-949-6837 or by email at info @ whynter.com or service @ whynter.com . based on your inquiry about a window being 4 ' off the floor , there is some information in the manual that might interest you . on page 16 under technical data : the maximum extended length of each expandable hose , either the exhaust or intake hoses provided with the ac , is 47 inches . on the manual 's page 8 installation instructions is the recommendation not to extend a hose more than 9 ft. long and `` additional 4 ' exhaust hose sold separately '' . that introduces the option to purchase additional hose lengths and an `` extender set '' comprised of a double-headed `` fixture '' piece to clip onto two more hose connector end pieces , thus extending the air-exchange hoses to ~ 8 ft. both diameters of expandable hoses , sliding-panels lengths to extend window kits , and various other accessories for the arc-131gd can be found on amazon and an `` extender set '' can be found at ambientstores.com . ( whynter can provide information on `` extender sets '' . ) accessories , either to extend a window kit to fill in the rest of the vertical opening in a sliding glass door or doubling the length of air-exchange hoses , `` do n't come cheap '' so , to avoid surprises when the ac is delivered , pre-planning the least expensive , best functioning installation beforehand , including researching less expensive options , is something to consider . 
if i understand your question , you are asking if the manufacturer of this portable ac , `` whynter arc-131gd '' , misrepresented the unit 's 13k btu rating , possibly making a `` false claim '' for the purpose of selling more acs for profit . i 'm not an engineer or an hvac professional , nor do i know of any specific equipment or agency that checks manufacturers ' btu ratings on `` portable '' air conditioners for accuracy and makes that information available to consumers . the epa , which manages the energy star program , does not rate `` portable '' air conditioners for efficiency with eer=energy efficiency ratings and does not award portables with energy star designations ... because , comparatively , portables are notoriously inefficient . those designations are reserved for considerably more efficient ac products like central air and ductless mini-splits . you can , however , calculate the eer of any portable as follows : an air conditioner 's eer is its british thermal unit ( btu ) rating over its wattage . from the specs ( if you trust them ) on the manufacturer 's website , the 131gd 's eer is 13000 btu 1180 watts , or a 11.02 eer . for an inherently inefficient `` portable '' , the 131gd 's eer is relatively high compared to other portables , which is desirable . however , from my personal perspective , the real value of knowing eers is the ability to compare similar units to determine which one will cost less to operate ( higher rating , less costly ) , but it does n't necessarily translate to which one will do the best job of air conditioning in specific situations . many more factors and variables should be considered in addition to eer before purchase . getting back to btu ratings being `` real or misleading '' , a btu thermal unit is a measure of energy . technically , it measures the amount of energy that is needed to heat 1 lb . of water by a single fahrenheit degree . that scientific definition sounds sufficiently descriptive and definitive to leave very little wiggle room for creative btu corporative interpretations to increase air conditioning manufacturers ' profits but , apparently , buyers must beware because it is rumored that not all btu ratings can be trusted ... as in the `` false claims '' that you point out . i take all manufacturers ' claims with a healthy dose of skepticism and was prepared to accept an air-to-air portable 's inherently inefficient and noisy shortcomings . i based my decision to purchase the whynter arc-131gd on multiple factors but primarily on the manufacturer 's square footage recommendations and on my previous portable experiences over the last fifteen years with one 11k , one 12k ( by whynter ) , and a previous 13k for the same space . as for how my arc-131gd actually cooled during this admittedly not-particularly-hot summer of 2014 in the northeast , i was impressed with its ability to cool its larger-than-manufacturer's-recommended area of `` up to 420 square feet '' . my targeted room measures 425 square feet but , depending on how many connecting doors in that room are left open , i can ( and mostly did ) increase the square feet of conditioned space up to 1000 square feet . from my own experience and from reading other arc-131gd reviews , i 've come to the conclusion that this unit performs better in spaces that exceed its recommended square footage of 420 square feet ... resulting in more constant running but less energy consumption because there is less compressor on off short-cycling ( necessitating an electrical surge to start the compressor each time ) with less annoying compressor on off noise and more interior moisture self-evaporatively exhausted outside with less short-cycling-induced moisture to condense and collect in its reservoir , which is designed , when filled , to shut the unit off . over the course of four months ' use during this relatively humid summer , i emptied 4 oz . of water ... once . is the manufacturer 's btu rating of this unit accurate ... or misrepresented ? without an independent evaluation by a reputable , credible source made available to the public , i do n't know . this portable did a great job for me this summer and i 'd recommend it ... specifically for rooms of 425 square feet or larger . 
the only 2 things i can suggest are to email customer service at service @ whynter.com or to call them at 866-949-6837. i spoke to them once and resolved my concern . 
5 '' diameter - just measured it 
the display on my remote tells me the time even when it is turned off . it displays additional status info when it is turned on . it sounds like your display is faulty if nothing shows up . i suggest you call the service phone number listed below the warranty at the back of the instruction manual . staff was helpful the one time i called them . 
the fan runs continuously as long as the unit is turned on . i am not at the house that has this unit right now . but , as i recall , auto fan is just a continuous fan setting . 
i have experienced these conditions this summer and it handled well . i also have a ceiling fan that helps also . 
hi , new guy ! one is dedicated intake , one is dedicated output . it makes the entire closed system more efficient . google ac one hose vs two hose , and you will likely get more educated answers , but i hope mine helps . two is well worth the money , over time . 
yup ! i have mine inside our ~900 sq ft condo in the dining room that joins with the living room . it has a few speed settings and i typically have it on the lowest for the ac setting , and i can easily hear our tv ( which is roughly 20-30 feet away ) . plus the remote digital display is portable so you can bring to the couch with you and turn it off or turn down the speed via the remote if too loud . it 's not a super quiet ac unit but it definitely is not annoyingly loud , either . 
no , just a regular plug . very convenient for placing anywhere you want it . 
no drain problem at all ! we own two of them ! one for each of my boy 's rooms and because of the dual air flow there is no need for the drain ! ( we use it exclusively for an air conditioner only , but it has other features ) 
i used a screwdriver . it did seem like it was going to break , but nothing broke . i do agree they should be easier to take off . 
the leds light up different colors for different modes ( blue is a c , green is fan , i do n't remember what the others are ) . they *only* light up when then unit is turned on , however . 
i had to cut the window insert down to 18 '' to fit my vertical window . i just measured , and i think 16 '' will work . the distance between the 2 holes for the air hoses is 12.5 '' so at 16 '' you will have nearly 2 '' on either side of the openings for support . the height is 6 3 4 '' . 
there is a control panel , but the functions are more limited than when you use the remote . the remote is the best way to control it . 
i do n't see that mine says it has a swing function . the louvers do n't move , but the unit swivels easily on it 's rollers . since i have n't set mine up yet ( i 'm in the boston area ) , i had to go to the manual and the unit itself to see if swing function was mentioned . 
hmm i do n't think so . sounds like mold . 
you should freeze it for a minimum of eight hours . bob b . 
i dont see why you ca n't ? it just freezes the liquid between ice . 
you need to get another one or a refund they are suppose to be full 
29.50 not a good deal 
not that i 'm aware of , it comes as a package deal 
no . too small . strong though . they are too thin or bottle cap . could probably do it if you doubled it up or even tripled them by stacking . 
i do n't know how strong other magnets are but here is an example of how strong these magnets are . i attached two stacks of five magnets to the bottom of a 16oz can was able to pull up and hold another 16oz can . 
they 're not that brittle but i doubt they 'd do what you want as they 're very small - roughly the size of a quarter of a dime 
woks on my frigidaire , not sure whats inside though : - ) 
these are strong for their size , specified at 1.5 pound pull . the magnets will stick together . it is the weight of the plexiglas that determines if they will hold . i would use several magnets , attaching them to the door and plexiglas with a very strong adhesive . 
neodymium - another chief use of neodymium is as the free pure element . it is used as a component in the alloys used to make high-strength neodymium magnets - powerful permanent magnets . [ 3 ] these magnets are widely used in such products as microphones , professional loudspeakers , in-ear headphones , and computer hard disks , where low magnet mass or volume , or strong magnetic fields are required . larger neodymium magnets are used in high power versus weight electric motors ( for example in hybrid cars ) and generators ( for example aircraft and wind turbine electric generators ) . [ 4 ] 
the collar stays are magnetic . i placed the collar stays inside of my shirt where it normally goes . i am a bit picky and i placed the magnet on the inside part of my dress shirt near my neck . it helps maintain the perfect stay . 
the most common stainless steel is type 304 , which is not magnetic . if you would like to learn the science , i suggest this link : http : www.scientificamerican.com article why-dont-magnets-work-on 
there are about 35 magnets in a single roll . you get one roll . 
good question . i will conduct an experiment and let you know . i do n't know how strong these are in quantitative terms but they are pretty damn strong for such tiny magnets . 
this is a mattress and pump ctrls set . this does not include a base . if you 'd like a base please contact us directly and we can help with that . 
there is no sleep trial available with this bed . we are very satisfied with our bed . you still get the warranty . excellent quality and easy assembly . 
yes , as long as you have a queen bed and not a short queen . 
i do n't have the adjustable base , but brochure that comes with the mattress says it will . the controller will automatically compensate . 
245 here , no problems . 
it smells like rubber for an hour or two but we did n't even notice any smell ; even on the first night . 
yes it keeps the presume right where you set it 
yes . queen bed with 2 side by side chambers . 
we used our box springs with ours worked great 
yes 
everything is covered under warranty . we are actually out of stock of demo 's so you would be getting a brand new bed . 
no it does not include a bed frame , if you want that it 's extra please call us at 888-694-4088 to buy one . 
when folded , the height is 5 1 8 '' , length 17 1 2 '' and width is 11 5 8 '' . the track height is 3 1 2 '' . when it is unfolded , the height is 4 1 4 '' and length is 31 1 2 '' ( board length ) . the tracks can slide out about 14 '' . i hope this helps . 
the board pulls out you need to make the drawer front mounted so it can drop down , like a false front ! 
building a new house and have not installed ironing board yet . sorry i can not help you 
yes you could . it pulls out . 
just straight . no swivel . 
i have no problem with it at all . it 's small , but sturdy , and kind of locks in place so it does n't move . mine is just mounted under my cutting table . very handy . 
31-1 2 '' long , 11-1 2 '' at widest 
about 14 inches wide so it clears a door . to explain the 18 1 2 '' measure the ironing board folds out , that is height it needs to clear an opening , the actual storage hight with the board folded is approx 6 '' . the ironing board is in 2 pieces and folds in half '' . hope this helps you . john and betsy 
we only have the shipping weight available ( 20lbs ) , but we are pretty sure the item itself weights less than 10lbs . 
we just added the installation sheet as an additional image . the height is 138 mm which is a little less than 5.4 '' in height . looks like that is too tall for you . 
not yet , but sometimes stick 
i do believe they are dishwasher safe . ( i do not have a dishwasher ) . yes they do have pour spouts and vents in the lid 
they area little on the small side . we bought them for our daughter to take to college and they were just the right size for that . they are great for one to three people , but too small for a larger family . they are great quality . 
yes it should . i put a magnet to the bottom of the pots and it clings so it has no aluminum in it . that 's the easiest way to tell . 
i dont see why not if anything i think it would work better 
yes 
mine say parini cookware 
they are riveted . they are secure . 
i do n't know , but the quality was very good which sorta argues against it ... 
yes . it is a remarkably good set of cookware for the money ! 
our pump and controllers are medical grade and measure the pressure in millimeters of mercury ( mm hg ) which is the industry standard in medical devices . sleep number pumps just measure in pressure . ours also come with two remotes , one per side , instead of one remote you have to share . ours also are wired so you do n't have to replace batteries , risk loosing the controller , and get and accurate dynamic read out of what is happening inside the chambers . with wireless you do not get that capabilities . we are in-fact a much better solution for the price . 
i used the box springs that we had . i just put a piece of 1 2 '' plywood on top of the box sprngs . works great . hope this helps you . 
yes . you can use this mattress with an adjustable bed base . 
we have regular deep pocket sheets and they work just fine on ours . 
yes also if you go to walmart and buy a 4inch piece of memory foam and replace the two pads that come with it , it makes a very comfortable bed for $ 140 more 
yes , it works just fine with that.. i have one.. 
it is a flat bed . does not incline . 
it is fairly quiet and runs only a short time to adjust to whatever setting you want . 
if you live in the state of fl you will be charged sales tax . 
ours appeared to be new with new packaging . i really do n't believe it was a demo . and we 're loving the bed . it was pretty easy to set up as well . 
the pan ( including handles ) measures 9 x 15 inches and is about 1-5 8 inches high . each cavity is about 3-3 4 inch in diameter and holds 3 4 cup of liquid when filled to the brim . ( you would use less cake batter to allow room for rising . ) 
yes but i do not recommend by hand only 
spray 
i do not use box mixed but for a regular recipe from scratch it makes this pan plus two more individual ones.. 
i am not sure what jumbo size would be , but they are pretty large . when i made some and brought them to bible study , we cut the in half ... .i love it . 
this item is available to be shipped to most countries worldwide . 
no , way too small , the diameter is more like a dime ; i tested your concept in the standard sized bundt pan with an airline-sized round plastic finlandia vodka bottle and that just fit in the big bundt ; in the little one you could probably fit a large-ish candle but that would be it in my opinion . the mini bundlette creates really neat looking shapes though and we 've tested it for all kinds of food like mashed potatoes which turn out very well . 
swirl cakes - 3 3 4 '' in diameter , larger than a regular cupcake which is 2 '' 
i can not speak for the trundle bed , but i have often been on the bed with my daughter ( 3 1 2 ) , and our combined weight does n't seem to be an issue . i weigh about 200 pounds ; she weighs closer to 30. it certainly seems sturdy enough to be a bed for an adult . 
no , it just slides out . 
no and i would not buy this bed - i had a terrible experience with this company when the bed rail broke in two . 
we used a regular twin on both beds and they work great . 
yes , just measured it and would fit fine . i have a 7 '' and there is still more room . 
yes it can - but the first night we had the bed - , the rail broke in half - not a strong bed - home and living has been terrible with us and still have not received the part 
hb 36 '' , fb 23 '' 12 12 slats 
comes in 2 boxes , quite a reasonable size . regular twin mattress sizes . the bottom mattress should be no more than about 8.5 '' tall . 
about 0.8 inches , they hold 1 8 cup 2 tbs 30 ml 
1 8 cup 2 tbs 30 ml 
i wish i could help you , but i do not have a toaster oven . 
hi tina . no , it 's only available in 12-cup . thanks . suzanne . 
around 1 2 to 3 4 of inch 
i have not had to grease mine . i love this pan and have used it several time for things other than muffins . 
i do n't know . i have looked for this information but ca n't find it . sorry ! 
no ! it 's a weird shot ! it 's totally cylindrical . it was the cheapest one i found and my fave ! ! ! came super well-packaged too . i might get another ! 
it is white & off white . no gold . 
i have sat on it and i am 170 # . it is sturdy . i have two of these and love them 
12.5 '' round , and 18 '' high 
mine was just over 17 '' tall and 13 '' diameter 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the product page , the dimensions are 13 '' in diameter x 18 '' in height . for future reference , this information can be found in the `` product description '' section of the product page . i hope this helps ! 
it is ceramic so i do not see why it could not . i would use it outside . 
no . just the bed 
9 3 4 inches from the longer side . if you went in from headboard side it would be about 10 1 2 inches 
your mattress will fit as this bed frame has a full bottom support slat system . 
there is about a 2 inch gap between the boards and i think a foam mattress would not add the support you need . it should be noted that the wood used for this bed is not at all high quality and if this is something you plan to have a child sleep on do n't expect long term use we bought 2 for our boys and they lasted for only just over a year . one of the 2 the wood split while we were putting together and had to use wood glue to fix . if it is something that will not be for daily use it could be ok. maybe ... 
i would say the bed is not that sturdy so adding more weight may not be a good idea in my opinion . 
there is no matress , thanks . 
not at all 
8 '' and slats , it 's a great bed 
no mattress 
my husband weighs 250 and has had no problems . it really is sturdy . 
its one piece . the foot rest is detachable but the cushion isnt . good luck 
i 'm 6.1 and my back is cover ! ! ! ! no worries for the price is a great deal ! ! ! ! 
that most definitely do . i plan to build some lateral support in the form of some low profile arms . as is they move very easily . 
yes , but sold couch after buying . cheap couch . 
that measurement is correct . is n't a chaise and a love seat . it 's a couch with a footrest . the couch us all one peice . 
what you see you get ! great sofa ! 
it 's thermostatically-controlled and stays at the desired temperature . it works very well . 
imo i would only use this on a heat resistant surface . 
it does not have an embossed pattern ... just the regular teflon surface . not the greatest of griddles , but it works . 
i would not recommend it . this does not heat properly . 
cord is a little over two feet long ( + - 26 '' ) . 
there is a channel around the griddle that collects the grease and it flows into a hole over the removable drip pan . 
the surface area is 10 '' x20 '' and there are no handles i think what you may think is a handle is the thermostat control . 
i wouldnt ! 
hi . i 'm not positive , however , i would think it should be no problem . 
no warming tray and a useless drip tray 
yes i bought it for the size so i can make enough for me and my children and one time . but i have used it just for myself with no problems . 
yes this has floating hinges.inch and a half-2inches high . 
yup ! a lil smashef , but delicious ! 
yes you can grill any kind of vegetables zucchini , give them a little bit salt and pepper will be perfect 
no , it does not , but you can simply stagger when you put certain foods on the grill in relation to one another . works fine for me grilling meat and veggies . 
16 1 2 '' x 9 '' one large plate . 
i felt the same way . it looks like this version is cheaply built , but seems to cook about the same . i did see that it will crack very easy if you 're not careful , i put a small crack in mine cleaning it & # 128542 ; 
karl - mine does n't . 
2 feet 
110 ! 
yes lol 
fixed 
yes , it 's designed specifically for cooking meat of all kinds . 
i would get the hamilton beach square because you can control the temperature 
there is no temp gauge on this model so it only cooks at one temp . i would n't cook frozen chicken breast on it unless it is thin cutlets . time would vary depending on how thick it is or if it 's boneless or not . you know , for the price it 's very versatile so just give it a go . 
it is not attached at all . it is a plastic tray that you slide under the edge of the grill . 
no it does n't have auto shut off but it is a very good grill . i have made fish and chicken breast on it and they both have came out real good . they have alot of flavor and very tender . the chicken cooks very fast and thoroughly ( : 
inside dimensions it 's 11 '' x 7 '' . it can fit 3 medium pork chops without bone across or 4 small ( 3 across and one sideways beneath it ) . cooks evenly no matter where you place meat or poultry on grill . hope this helps . 
dont eat the plastic ... it 's really undigestable . 
sure but only a few . this is a smaller grill . it is non-stick . if you start using sprays on it you 'll ruin the non-stick quality as the aerosols ruin the grill finish . 
i think you can grill just about anything on it , we do hotdogs and chicken breast tenders , you can marinate your meat first , also you do n't have to do meat , if vegetarian you can grill veggies , it is totally non-stick surface , you can also grill sandwiches . it is very easy to operate , you plug it in and wait for the green light to come on , it is now ready . we can grill up to five foot long hot dogs or maybe 6 or 7 regular size at a time . it is big enough to grill two large hamburger or veggie patties or four small ones at a time . it is super fast and does not heat up the kitchen , so we use it a lot during the summer . i usually wipe it clean with a damp paper towel . or use a sponge with water and a squirt of dish soap then a damp paper towel . i think you can grill just about anything with it . i love mine ! 
only if they are removable . . . otherwise wipe down with soapy cloth then rinse off . the new models clean very easily . 
120v 1400watts 
no , you have to unplug when done or you want turned off ... . 
temp on this unit is a light thats red for warming up and green for done . very simple . 
the measurement is 7 3 4 inches both in width and length . 
yes you can . you can grill anything , i grill steak , chicken , fish 
no they can not be removed unless you unscrew them from the frame 
assembly of the grill is very easy . just set the grill plate on the grill and pull out the pins on either side of the plate and it will drop in and just release the pins . do the same for the other grill plate . 
inside grill is 11 1 2 inches long 8 inches wide . i have 5-6 nice hamburgers on it . with the lid adjustment for height i cooked sausage and chicken , thighs and legs . also great for cooking bacon when you need a lot of slices cooked . 
no , but i have only had mine for six months . it grills chicken evenly with the grill marks making it taste like it just came off of the grill . im very happy with my purchase . an easy way to clean up for me is to place wet paper towels onto the grill and close the top . making sure it was been unplugged of course . return and hour later , throw out the towels , wiping off as much yuck as possible.then i clean with a soapy sponge and rinse . so easy . never take a scrubber to the grill pieces or else you 'll damage the the surface of the grill plates . 
do n't know exact weight , but no problem handling easily , even lifting to a high shelf . 
yes 
yes both the top and bottom cooking plate is removeable . 
i have this unit and i think 350 is medium . i cook steaks nd burger on maximum and i think it is about 425 to 450. hop this helps . 
no it does not . only thing i do n't like is cord real short . 
i do n't think so , at least not in the ordinary sense . the bottom grill in mine has raised ridges running 'down ' to the front to drip out the grease . the upper has ridges as well , except they 're kind of a 'herringbone ' pattern . if you tried to bake a hotcake on the foreman , it would look more like a waffle if you had the top down . i guess the answer is , not unless you can buy one with a flat plate , it is a great meat cooker , but do n't know how it 'd be as a griddle . rg 
absolutely not . the us model is 110 only ! 
12.6 x 4.1 x 12.4 inches 
no thermometer , just a knob that slides from left to right . 
no , the trays are fixed . 
the actual cooking surface is 11 '' x 7 '' . 
it does have a plastic grease tray that sits under the front of the grill . it is not attached to the grill . 
i 'm not sure of the exact temp , but i do n't think it 's very hot . i cook everything with the slider all the way to the right ( hottest ) , and , unless something is wrong with my foreman , i do n't think it is as hot as it should be . 
i seriously doubt that it works with 220v . the plug supplied is for a standard 110v outlet . additionally , if an optional voltage were possible , i would think there would have to be a switch on the unit to set to said voltage supply . the only way i see to use 220v is if there is a step down transfer on site that would convert to 110v . 
i have the gr2081hm . it is 120v ~ 60hz drawing 1200w . 
the one i have is 110v . 
they 're ridges 
would have to measure it but it fits a double bed ( that is what i bought if for ) just fine . plenty to hang over the edges and to tuck the end if need to looks great 
i have washed in washing machine and it came out fine ! 
74 x 86 for the full 
there are pillow cases like the sheets and two like the comforter same swirl pattern 
thanks for your interest , this listing is available by independent sellers on amazon . you can read about their shipping and return policies by clicking the `` domestic shipping rates '' and `` return policy '' buttons for each seller here : 
100 % polyester . machine was cold gentle , no bleach , dry tumble . it has a little sheen to the fabric . it washes well . 
dear friend , this is a duvet cover , not include the comforter insert : ) ) and for this item , it 's a flat sheet , not the fitted sheet , and we only have queen size now : ( sorry for that , on our store , have many 3d bedding , please take a look : ) ) 
i guess they mean it kinda looks like an oil painting . but it 's not 3d . 
yes it is a beautiful set i love it 
melanie , most certainly a copy . we have two , and they are fine specimens from a company interested in making high quality reproductions . we looked at the louis xiv version at dwr , and the non-louis ghost ( the armless ones we bought ) and opted for the reproductions as office chairs . we 're very pleased with them ( we spend ~1-2 hours on them day , unless we work from home , and they 've yet to be uncomfortable ) . we are also planning on buying the flash version of the aforementioned louis xiv to complement other authentic first run dwr chairs at our dining table . we 're impressed : good luck . 
hello ! at the chair 's rear , where the seat attaches to the seatback , the width is 11.5 '' . midway between the seatback and front , it 's 12.0 '' . and at the seat 's front , it 's 13.5 '' . note : the maximum width is at the rear , where the legs attach to the seatback : 15.0 '' . we bought two : they 're fantastic ! 
estimate : 15x13 in . 
the chair is 36 '' high , 15 '' wide , and seat is 19 '' high . very comfortable . 
they do not have protective covering . however , they do n't look they would scratch . they are smooth on the bottom . 
hi . i bought two . they came stacked up in one box wrapped in bubble wrap . no way to take apart this chair it 's one piece . 
yes , they came in one box . excellent quality ! 
vendor has long needed to update their description on this item ... ! ! ! ! the chair is clear , with possibly a bluish or purplish cast ''in some lights '' ... but , truthfully , you wo n't notice it . it 's really nice as it takes up almost zero visual space , which wo n't shrink your room space down . 
these seem more decorative than sturdy work horses for the kitchen . i use mine at my kitchen desk , which i actually rarely sit at , because i am always running about ! this chair functions more for a decorative piece that looks good , and you can sit on it , but not for extended use . 
the chair i received is transparent crystal . 
i would say six to eight in . lowered the bed nicely , at least for us it did . 
it 's metal and very sturdy . i 'm very happy with it . 
yes , a headboard can be attached , although i was lazy and just propped ours against the wall . the frame has a pair of vertical rectangular metal plates at the two corners at the head of the bed . the plates have several horizontal slits suitable for putting screws through to attach a headboard . 
yes perfect snug . adjusts to all sizes . setup very easy . best frame i ever had . only thing no bolting bracket for footboard , just for headboard . 
you push them on and they kind of lock in place . not welded or screwed in . i really like this frame . i have a queen serta icomfort intellectual with boxspring and i am a heavy guy , and it works great . frame is really sturdy . 
there 's no movement in the legs . very strong frame . i was surprised that the frame makes our bed considerably lower but i guess that 's a good thing . 
measured from the floor to the bottom of the frame is 6 '' . 
we did not use the rollers but i 'm almost certain it came with all 9 
they are not adjustable in height . it 's 6 '' from the floor to the bottom of the frame . with my box spring and mattress , the overall height is about 2 feet . 
i did not get what i ordered . the one that came was a 6 leg bed frame 
hi james ! thank you for your inquiry ! seat size : 13.25 '' w x 16.5 '' d back size : 14 '' w x 18.75 '' h seat height : 19 '' h arm height from floor : 26.5 '' h arm height from seat : 8 '' h overall width : 21.125 '' w overall depth : 23 '' d overall height : 36.5 '' h weight capacity : 400 lbs . aiste bisonoffice 
you are right . actual width for your bum is 17 '' at the front of chair and 13 '' at the back . the arms add an additional inch on all corners . so total of 19 front , 15 back . 
completely crystal clear . beautiful clarity . no grey undertones . 
it wo n't be comfortable as they are narrow . 
they are definitely a quality product although i ca n't verify that they are from the same manufacturer . we are completely pleased with what we bought . 
arm height from floor : 26.5 '' h arm height from seat : 8 '' h 
no , it is perfectly beautiful lots of compliments ! 
my chair is clear . however , you should call amazon and determine whether the listing is correct . 
it 's crystal clear , no hint of black at all . love , love , love this chair ! 
it 's technically lucite which is basically fancy plastic . they look fantastic but are really lite weight so it makes them feel cheap . i adore the look and cleaning them is a breeze 
it 's confusing . this juicer is 6th gen. but the rule is : 8003 and 8005 are the same , 8005is in chrome color . 8004 and 8006 are the same , 8006 is in chrome color . 8007 and 8008 are the same , 8008 is in chrome color . and the nc 800 and 900 are the same , but in different color . 8003-8006 is the 4th gen , 8007-8008 are the 5th gen. and the ncseries are the 6th gen. i hope it 's helpful to you 
for green leafy vegetables , carrots , beats and green smith apples it 's 5 , other soft fruits it 's 1-2 . 
i understand the 900 has a larger feed chute and has the adjustment on the ejection port for different consistencies of veggies . go to omega 's website , look up the two juicers and click on `` add to compare '' on both juicers and then open the comparison window . i have the 900 which i use about 3 times a day ... .it is a great juicer . i would not want a smaller feed chute . hope this helps a little bit . i am guessing but it seems the 900 is a bit of an upgrade but is also more expensive . 
yea , you can juice just soft fruits veggies just fine . i made a wheatgrass and pineapple juice this morning , both softness . i 've on many occasions used solely wheatgrass other greens . the rrecommendation of using a hard item in conjunction is to make sure there is no clogging . however , it is n't necessary . and if it does clog , not take a less than a minute to rinse out the clog and reattach . 
yes , according to omega 's website . 
from my research , the nc900 `` chrome '' is more because of the chrome color . i guess they are looking at it like appliances . stainless is always more than the other colors . i hope this helps . 
it 's plastic , but it 's very durable . i imagine it 's due to the weight , as it 's already somewhat heavy . 
no it should not wiggle , everything should fit tightly together and turn smoothly . 
this item is made in south korea . 
have n't tried garlic but i do n't see why not . i tried beets , carrots , leafy greens , ginger , apple , celery , fennel , etc and they worked great . yield is pretty good . my husband and i are very happy with this model . 
i just got off a half hour conversation with a really nice lady at omega , and i had the same question . the nc800 and nc900 are identical , by the way - the only difference is the color . the differences between the nc800 900 and the 8006 is the larger chute and adjustible end-cap . that adjustible end-cap lets you fin omee tune the amount of pulp in your juice . the lady at omega said some people can find there 's a learning curve to using the end-cap . i just ordered the nc800 because of the wider chute . by the way , the j8004 and j8006 are identical machines , just different colors : j8004 is white , j8006 is chrome colored ( not chrome metal ) . the nc8004 is cheaper because it takes an extra step to apply the chrome color . 
use a soft fruit first , strawberries , peaches etc . then a hard fruit , carrots , ginger etc . alternate between the two . the hard fruit seems clean out the filter so juice keeps a coming . 
my neighbor had the 8006 which is why i looked at omegas in the first place . i borrowed it and ultimately decided to get a centrifugal style juicer because of two shortcomings : clogging , difficulty with soft veggies and fruits , and the small strips you had to reduce your veggies into in order to fit them through the feed chute . so when this model came out , addressing those limitations , i purchased it without hesitation and have no regrets . absolutely worth the higher price . 
i had a 8006 before i upgraded and i would say it 's not worth it . the big difference i noticed was that i did n't have to cut cukes into four pieces lengthwise anymore , half would suffice . since i juiced spinach everyday for the past 3 weeks on this machine and for 1 year on my old 8006 i noticed that juicing was quicker but if i still had my 8006 at the time of purchase i would n't have bothered with the nc800 . if you have money to burn i then buy it , it 's a nice enough upgrade but if you are counting pennies , do n't get it . 
i 've tried but it comes out really dry , more like an almond flour kind of thing , by putting that powder into a food processor you see the oil that barely starts coming out . someone has suggested to add oil to it but that is not the answer , i am still researching the right way of doing it and i will post it as soon as i do find out . the machine at whole foods makes it really easy and almonds go in without oil and they are not soaked as i have seen the machine being loaded with dry almonds they keep in a big plastic bag inside a box and they look pretty dry to me . 
you should contact omega . the juicer is under warranty . they will trouble shoot this with you to find out what the problem is . they will replace any parts that need replaced and advise you on any changes that need to be made in your juicing proceedure or any thing else . their phone number is 800-633-3401 . 
sorry we do not have this juicier in 220v . 
hi eric , the 220 volt is not available in the us at this time , and as we understand it , there are no plans to bring the international model to the us for sale anytime soon . harvest essentials does offer other omega juicer models in 220 volt however . 
hi there , the nc800 and nc900 are not available in 220 volt in the us market at this time . there is no estimated date or commitment for either of them to be available in the us at this time . 
this marvelous appliance has only been ul tested at 120 volt - 60 hz , 150 w it will not run on your electricity without a converter 
we have n't tried making smoothies with our vrt400 . it is primarily a juice extractor and it does a great job of that . no matter what fruit or vegetable you put into it , it squeezes the juice out and leaves all the fibre and pulp behind . my opinion is that you would want to use a blender to make smoothies , not a juicer . 
no , the warranty is valid when purchasing from any authorized dealer ( like us ! ) . to order please use this link : http : www.amazon.com omega-vertical-masticating-juicer-vrt400 dp b00ciu8xyk ref=sr_1_14 ? m=aycjzs8twa85p & s=merchant-items & ie=utf8 & qid=1370465375 & sr=1-14 thanks , mike . coolshinystuff 
there is a removable rubber seal that keeps the tap closed . it is hinged and can be left open as well . 
i am not sure why amazon would state 2 years . it is n't 2 years since amazon does n't warranty the product . the warranty is through omega and per their website the omega vert has a 10 year warranty . omegajuicers.com 
yes , there is only one model . sometimes the `` hds '' is not included in the name for convenience . 
yes and yes . this is not a secret . it 's a well known fact that this juicer ejects pulps into the juice ( just google it ) . what 's not clear and hard to define is the amount and the size of pulps because it depends on the greens . also , the personal tolerance or preference to pulps is different . some people claim that they like the pulps in their juices but that 's kind of absurd . one of the important reasons that we make juices over blending is that it 's pulp free , fiber free , and easily drinkable so that the body can absorb nutritions faster . i 'd tell people that to make blending instead if they like pulps , which i do in the morning to get extra fibers . to make comparisons to other juicers that i have used , breville and omeage 8006 do not eject any pulps to the juice . if i may add , nothing tastes better than smooth , silky , fresh , delicious juices ! 
it is available in the 220 volt model and that will be $ 15 to $ 20 more for that model . you will have to order that model and not the 110 one . 
korea 
15 years ! ! ! you can check the website . as i understand it , some juicers shipped with paper work indicating a 10 year warranty , but even those are covered by the newer , 15 year warranty . 
warranty claims can be made by calling 800-633-3401 during normal business hours between 8:30am and 5:00pm eastern , monday thru friday excluding weekends and holidays . all claims must include : make , model number , serial number , proof of purchase ( dated receipt ) , month and year of purchase and any important information explaining the problem . thank you for asking veggiesensations . see our offer for this product & # 9660 ; & # 9660 ; & # 9660 ; & # 9660 ; 
yes , if you pinch it real tight it turns white . i just tried it . what does that mean ? 
hey can hold up to 3.75 ounces . since liquids expand when frozen , it 's best to leave a 1 2 inch or so at the top . i would plan for 3.5 ounces x 6 = 21 ounces . 3.75 ounces = 110.9 ml . 
i put them in a plastic cup upright.they freeze perfect every time ! 
no , they do n't ; they are simply inserted and would most likely spill in the lunch bag . 
not to my knowledge . just do not overfill them when you place them in the freezer . 
i received the emails and recipes , however , in reading other people 's responses someone gave the website for the company that sells these . the website is : http : www.siliconedesigns.com go to their website and there is an option for `` contact us '' . i 'm sure you can let them know you did n't receive the recipe emails and they would respond . 
yes . they are fda approved . 
i put them in cups or glass mugs i already have in the freezer . 
yes , of course . though i would n't rely on them to toss them in freezer or lunch box . 
when i ordered the ice pops , they automatically emailed the recipes to me . they have great customer service , they emailed me a number of times . 
yes , very fine serrations . quality is exceptionally good in my opinion with a beautiful high polish on the steak knives in particular . only draw back about this set is you have to buy the 3 big knives separately ( block has empty slots for them ) and they run $ 146 for the 3 total , but it 's a heirloom quality set so i just ordered one at a time when i could so it did n't seem like so much money at once . the 3 additional knives that are ordered as open stock to fill the 3 empty slots are : classic boning $ 42 , classic 7-inch santoku with hollow edge $ 57 , classic 7-inch bread knife $ 47 . bob b . 
yes , these are the classic steak knives with a fine serration . they are very sturdy and well made . made in spain stamped on the blades . 
yes it does have a block with it ! 
yes , they are all in the classic series . i 'm very pleased with them . 
spain , stamped right on the blade . 
the block is approximately 11 '' deep by 4 1 4 '' wide and with knives in it about 13 '' high . 
yes , 3 extra slots . 
yes it is accurate . 
i have not had any issues with mine rusting at all . 
the classic line is made in spain , not china . you can even see 'made in spain ' on the knife that is shown on the picture for this item . 
only a pretty short one . my wife bought me one with it and it was about 1 4 '' too tall . you 've got 4.75 '' of clearance - a mug taller than that wo n't fit . this is a small unit . 
it works better with the pods , because it does n't have the little puncture thing for k-cups we bought a small box of them by mistake and have been just opening the little container and pouring it in and it works . 
no it does not require filter paper . it is a mesh cup . this little coffee maker makes a great strong cup of coffee , better than a keurig . just remember to unplug it after use . i like it because i could make a cup as needed . it looks flimsy but it really work , for the price ; give it a try . 
yes it does come with a reusable basket , and you can also use those cafe cups too 
yes 
it has a permanent , fine mesh filter that you just put the grounds into . 
it shuts off automatically when it runs out of water . 
i need one also if you find one please let me know and i will do the same for you 
the filter has a cylindrical shape . since it is for a single cup of coffee i think the shape is just fine . it allows the water to drip through the coffee and the entire batch of grounds gets wet so i believe it allows the water to drip through at a slow enough pace that it gets full flavor from the coffee . if you want a stronger cup then adjust the amount of grounds you use until you get it the way you want . 
it does n't use pods or k cups . you put one scoop of regular coffee grounds in it and it works just fine . i use mine every morning 
it has something to do with hydraluxe gel technology which is a special gel that is layered into the pillow . sellers indicate that `` independent testing show the gel layer to be 15 degrees cooler to touch and stays cooler up to six times longer than traditional memory foam . '' none of the selling sites that i checked gave specifics as to what the components ingredients are in the special cooling gel . however , my grandson sleeps very hot and assured me that the pillow really works . 
i actually have two items on it . a cotton protector with side zip and a silk pillowcase . it still works like a charm ! 
you 're not going to clean the entire pillow . you just want to spot clean it . again , it does n't harbor bacteria and mold like normal pillows do , so do n't worry that it 's got germs , you know , if you 're a bit of a hypochondriac , the best thing to have is memory foam . just sprinkle baking soda on it , grab your vacuum . vacuum the baking soda off . now , if you need to spot clean it , just have a cup of mild dish soap and water and use paper towels . just use a clean rag and wipe the pillow down with the soap and water mix . then use paper towels , but just press it on there . the water will really be down in the foam . so you want to keep a towel on top of it and just let it sit over night . let it get completely dry before you put a pillow case back on it . 
it is a firm soft if that makes sense . it is not hard at all . i love this pillow ! 
i have n't noticed any ; my sheets leave more crease marks on my arms than this pillow leaves on my face . the bubbles really are n't that noticeable through the pillowcase . 
dont buy from amazon its bad quality not same as sold in market buy it from market is beter 
sorry i have no idea as we have not run across that . other than washing the pillow case , i would suggest maybe baking soda . 
sorry i do n't know the density and the manufactor normally does not specify on pillows . i can attest that it is low density as i my head sinks into the pillow . my spouses pillow was $ 130 and has higher density . higher density equals higher price . 
yes . it will disappear after a time , however . 
about 15 minutes but then i move my head to the other part of the pillow where it 's cool and a a few minutes later move back and it 's cool again . it is cool but never cold . 
it is a heavy duty insulated plastic , dish washer safe ( i only place it on the top rack , however ) . i can honestly tell you this is one of the best purchases i ever made . the glasses keep cold things cold and warm thing warm . my elderly mother lives with us and she , my husband and i all love them and highly recommend them . 
yes , they 're expensive but worth it . i 've been using mine daily for about 3 months now and it 's still looks brand new . 
all four sides have bas-relief images or text -- no room for a decal bigger than 1 '' square . 
yes 
i 'm not sure . i actually found these cheaper at walmart & returned them for a different size . they are not the same size openings as the mason jars i currently have though . 
no ! on the bottom it says : do not microwave , but it also says that you can put it on the top rack of a dishwasher ( maybe you wanted to know too ) . 
plain and simple - seo . search engine optimization . 
yes it will . my husband keeps liquor in a cabinet so it 's room temp as well . by the time he drinks it it is cold . 
they are steel with a liguid core 
the writer made a mistake it 's a stocking stuffer like you hang on christmas . 
china 
they are metal cubes . mine only look ... metal . maybe that 's how they look if you set them out damp in warm weather . 
they are made in china , just like all the others ones on here . 
behind a small flip-up cover about half-way up the left side of the unit when you are facing it . it is set back a few inches from the front of the unit . 
this is not one of the units that has been recalled . i actually purchased this one as a replacement for a recalled unit . sadly , it is nowhere near as quiet as the original unit . 
i found it very easy . i just turned off the unit , slid the bucket out , emptied it , and slid it back in . but as i was doing that once or twice a day , i opted to move the unit up onto a stool and attached a short piece of hose ( 4 ft ) that emptied into a small plastic 20-gal trash can . that extends the dump time to 3 days ! 
it turns off ! also , it has a 2 hour and a 4 hour setting : ) 
it has n't so far . i expect it is a safety feature . 
check the manual here for the troubleshooting section : http : www.soleusair.com manuals 2011 % 20manual sg-deh-30m % 2045 % 2070-1a % 20soleus % 20manual % 203-31-2011.pdf sometimes i think it 's just the fan kicking up a speed every once in a while . 
no , but you can hook a hose up to it for continuous drain and feed the hose into the drain and this will eliminate the emptying bucket . 
when the light comes on it needs to be cleaned . refer to your instruction included with your unit , it tells you how to clean it . 
yes , as long as it has a 3 prong plug which includes a ground . 
pull out the compartment in the front of the unit that holds the water . when its completely out of the machine look inside at the top and there is a pull tab that you pull down and that is the filter . just pull it out clean it and slide it back in . 
when you open the picture and run your cursor over the quilt , you will see it up close . i have an apple computer , and the colors shown in the picture are true to the actual quilt . when you run your cursor over the pillow sham , you will see some brownish tan . there is n't really any jade . the green is quite soft ... ... kind of like a turquoise paint with a lot of white mixed in . all the colors are quite muted . you would probably want to use a cream colored bed skirt with it . 
it 's a printed design 
china 
the cart is 31 high , 18 wide ( add 2 inches for handles ) , and 11 deep . 
we put one tier with an onions bag ( 2-3 lbs ) , we put another tier with a 5 lbs potato bag , and the rest with misc . items . 
no , the shelves are not adjustable . yes , it is easy to put together - i put it together by myself in a few minutes . 
6 inches from top of basket to bottom of basket on top of it . 
the box is as long and wide as the 2 end pieces because the shelves need to be put on after arrival .

i did not use this product . the quality of this cart was very poor . after i put it together it needed some way to make it stable . after several attempts at solutions i threw this cart away . i then found a better cart at bed bath and beyond .

yes , one of my favorites is peanut butter and spinach and do n't be shy to add lots of ice it have a powerful motor for handling every task . 
i believe yes you can boil they are glass and metal . but let me tell you that i returned this blender-set because the many plastic parts are very bad quality . also , it leaked on the bottom and the jar lid did not close tight either . i read here in amazon a better deal for a blender in walmart . 
i grind up dry dog food . i am sure it will grind grains 
yes ! ! parts are universal . i am using my old blender jar with it . 
is shiny like a mirror 
ok 
i 'm not sure of the voltage in singapore , but this is a standard 120v appliance with the corresponding plug . 
i 'm certain it is not a compatible plug . you will need a universal converter . i do not know about the voltage . you will have to check with mfg. , oster . 
the outer casing is made of plastic . that does not mean the motor is . 
i have no idea ... : - ) . in my experience , blender blades seem to be almost universal in size functionality ( regardless of brand ) you may want to google it , contact your neighborhood appliance repair shop or contact oster at 1-800-334-0759 or www.oster.com . good luck ! 
yes , john the ekobrew will work with the kg6 model . i have the kg6 model and i am using the ekobrew . it fits real good and have n't had any problems with it . the only problem that i have encountered was i tried to use a coffee that was ground real fine but a standard of the shelf will work real good . do not pack the coffee down tight in the ekobrew as that will restrict the flow of hot water thru the coffee grounds . just use a coffee scoop or a teaspoon to pour the grounds into the ekobrew . read the instructions on the ekobrew and you should enjoy a good cup of coffee . i like a large cup of coffee so i use the 10 oz setting . good luck and enjoy a good cup of coffee . chet w5cla @ yahoo.com . 
not at all ! we tried 2 different times but both of them would cause the k-cups to explode and coffee would go everywhere . do n't waste your time or money on this . 
according to the user manual , 1 year limited warranty . 
if you submitted the manufacturers warranty contact them directly or contact amazon customer service . 
so far any k-cup i 've purchased in the grocery store has worked . i 've had hot chocolate , cappachino , apple cider , iced sweet tea . hope this helps . 
i use the reusable `` my k-cup '' coffee filter by keurig and yuban dark coffee . i like a good strong cup of coffee as well . since this has the 6,8 or 10 ounce cup coffee choice , you can try them all to make the best taste as to how strong you like it . i think i made the best choice in coffee makers as it fits my moods . sometimes , in the afternoon , i will make a cup and only want 6 or 8 oz cup of coffee . i love that it has options ! 
to turn the unit off , press and hold the brew off button . 
the kg6 has no `` twin '' made by keurig . mr. coffee has a licensing agreement with keurig to use the same brew technology , but the two companies do not share any machine designs . any re-usable k-cup filters that work in the keurig units ( but not the new 2.0 models ! ) will work in the mr. coffee units as both companies use the same k-cup extraction design . 
yes , as long as you buy the little filters to go in it . we love ours and i drink regular coffee sometimes . 
yes . each pot is intended for a single use . i find if you try more than once the coffee is too weak . i like mine a little stronger so i even only to 8oz or 6oz for each pod instead of the bigger 10oz . & if i have a bigger cup i do 2 6oz or 2 oz . to get it a little stronger . i have found buying the reusable insert & using reg . coffee is more cost effective . 
i got the similar one as the first one . but not exact the same ! not same as any of those pictures . i wish i can post the picture of it here . 
it is black : ) hope this helps 
i really did not pay attention on the package and i do not have the package any more , sorry . 
this should fit over a 1.5 '' door . 
most of the door can be fited for the hanger.2 '' is availabled 
this was a gift to my daughter , who has a flat top range , and she loves this cookware . she said the food heats and cooks evenly.she very happy with with the set and wants more pieces . 
i have washed it in dishwasher on light wash with no problems . 
the 2 pans that my wife received look kind of small compared to what we normally use . nice looking but smaller than i think they should be . 
the interior is made of an non-stick material . i do n't know if it is teflon or an improved version of it . the interior seemed like good quality . you will have to check with the manufacturer for the exact specs . porcelin bottom pots are not recommended for electric cooktops . make sure this rachel ray set is appropriate for the type of cooktop you have . 
yes . it can . and it is a great product ... had 1 pan ... then had to buy the whole set 
no , 
no . a magnet will not stick to the bottom . 
yes , i would rather use an electric stove with these because the handles get very very hot on a gas stove . my daughter has burned her hands several times using these pots and pans . 
i do n't have a glass top ( i have electric ) so i 've not tried , but the recommendation from the manufacture indicate the cookware should not be used on glass tops . and , the bottom of the pans are coated in the same material as the sides . 
i can only speak from my experience & unfortunately the answer is yes . i only had the kettle for a little over a month & it rusted on me was very disappointed faberware really needs to take this one back to the drawing board . hope this helps i recommend you keep shopping . 
yes 
on the box it says it 's manufactured in vellejo , california . 
copper is better for it heats more quickly . other than that they are pretty much the same . 
maybe a 32nd of an inch thickness on the bottom . it says it is stainless steel . oh , and the handle is rigid . no movement . it does whistle when it 's boiling . i 'd post a pic next to my hand if i could to show how tiny it is . 
i do n't know why they did it this way , but you do n't get burned when using it . 
it 's been a while since i bought it but i think i recall it being in its own box . 
yes , i believe it did . the odor did eventually go away , i boiled lemon juice in it several times . 
the tea kettle comes in retail packaging ... . 
yes . 
one year 
yes to the browning , it has different types of food , rice , beef , chicken , etc settings and does the pressure accordingly . 
the material is definitely not the oder-like like teflon material which was deemed to be a hazard . so far , our liner has not been any problem with multiple use . we use plastic and wooden utensils . ism sure if you google the manufacture website and contact them you could obtain the exact name of the liner material . so far , it 's been a wonderful multi use appliance . 
we sorry but that option is not available we with this purchase . we did contact our suppliers to try and find a stainless steel pot however they are not able to provide that with this model . we wish you a happy holiday season ! 
sorry but not familiar with this subject . 
the direction say that you can . i have not used it for canning yet . sorry i can not be more helpful . 
i do not know . my neighbor love it however , and it is quite large . you can google it on line ... 
the manual says 12 psi . here is the link to the manual http : www.maxi-matic.com product.php ? productid=206 & cat=80 & page=1 ( page 4 ) 
made in china 
yes , you can adjust time for any cooking , like stew , poultry , vegi ... i love mine very much , save me a lot of time . 
the book lacks in forthcoming information . i was not looking for it but do not remember seeing yogurt listed . 
just for vegetables , but not for meat . 
i would start by going to the company 's website 
teflon 
i have not actually timed it but i would guestimate about 10 minutes + - 
yes it does . i cook everything in it . it 's an amazing pressure cooker 
this is a great cooker it has good safety features but is good for a large family , and a large kitchen counter space . 
it 's about 20 inches across and 6.5 inches deep . yes it can be used for basic canning with the water bath method . it recommends you purchase a separate instruction booklet 
inside the pot there are the typical holes where the spout begins . not necessarily a screen . we always have percolator coffee pots and discovered a few years ago that the small ( 4-6 cup size ) paper filters fit in the basket just right and greatly reduce the grounds in your cup . all you have to do is add another 1 4 scoop of coffee to offset any weakness in your brew from using a paper filter . i hope this helps . 
donot buy the maximatic . it does not have auto shut off and nearly burnt my kitchen down : ) ) 
no i have nt & # 128522 ; . i pull the plug it will keep the coffee warm for a while 
i think black and decker made the pot i would try them 
the coffee pot is 1000 watts 
i bought this for my father as a christmas present . and the auto turn off would turn on and off at random . a month later it went in the trash . i would not recommend this item . it is cheaply made in china . 
it was made in china . still waiting for a canadian or american one 
not to my knowledge . the inside and lid are all ( or at least seem to be ) stainless steel . 
most likely the `` auto-off '' feature is a function of the 'boil dry ' safety feature : pot gets hot ! as it becomes empty and thus automatically switches 'off ' : witch is coupled with the automatic `` keep warm '' { not hot } when the pot is still partially full ( ~1 6 ) , and is not empty and getting hot . ~ rhf 
i had to buy another percolator after six months , because this one did not keep the coffee as hot as it once did ... .. 
unfortunately not yet . they promised me in the future . st is great company i did n't get answer when it will be integrated or who set 's the priority 
it is . 
i just received my unit a week ago and it is v1.6h . i have trouble getting it to work though . 
it should . 
yes you can 
i have large home with adt pulse but due to the limitations of adt pulse i also have a mi casa verde system installed . this will not work with adt pulse but it works with the vera system . the only negative is that the remotec does not communicate with the my split system remote . so if i turn on my ac with my remote , the remotec does not recognize that the ac is on from the vera ui . 
yes it will 
their hub supports zwave so it is compatible with the hardware . however this from their help center site would give me pause `` also , staples connect is an open system . other devices ( including z-wave , z-wave plus , wifi , and lutron clearconnect ) may work with the system but we ca n't guarantee their full functionality . '' 
yes 
this will work with any ac with infrared remote control . if the ir codes are not available built in you should be able to teach the unit the ir codes using the original remote . 
yes , it is true to size . i love this crock pot it is one of the largest ones i could fine . i searched a long time . works great . 
so sorry this took so long , i was out of town . this pot is slightly under 5 inches deep . its a great slow cooker . d 
this crock pot is huge you can fit a xl roast and xl turkey breast in it with room to spare ! love it only down side is it is very heavy . 
ok , first off , i bought this as a gift for my daughter who has a family of 6. she does n't travel , so i do n't know . but i can tell you she uses large rubber bands on hers , even at home , to help keep a really snug seal while it is cooking . 
both sides and bottom 
i believe it was china 
not that i know of . the cooking chamber is ceramic . the rest is aluminum , plastic and glass . 
seal 
i would contact the company directly . i am sure they sell replacement parts . 
do n't know . never tried them . 
already there 
it 's either a hard rubber or soft plastic . it 's not too slick on my tile floor . 
hello , the footprints are printed on the mat . 
no . it 's bpa free hard plastic . very durable . 
i doubt it but you would have to check with amazon or the mfg . good luck ! 
i just purchased it myself i do n't sell anything sorry . 
probablly in china . it 's a piece of junk ! the lid broke off the very first time i used it ! 
the unit dimensions is 24 '' w x 20.625 '' d x 14.5 '' h 
the voltage is 115v ( 60hz ) 
according to manufacturer website , the product weight is 74 lbs . please review manufacturer website and user manual for details . http : www.soleusair.com sg_ttw_10ese.html http : www.soleusair.com manuals 2013 % 20manuals ttw sg-ttw-10ese % 20manual % 202013-03-20.pdf 
does have the energy star rating emblem on control panel . do n't know anything more on that . ours is used on enclosed patio and is set at 70 during the day . has remote . it seems to maintain that temp and is accurate . 
yeap , thats what i plugged mine into . 
depends on how deep the shell is . mine extends about 4 inches and the decorative she 'll hides it 
approximately 4 ' long . 
we know that it comes with aluminum grille included with the unit and must be used . for details , please call soleus at 888-876-5387 . 
the dimension is 24 '' w x 20.625 '' d x 14.5 '' h . 
there is no drip line . they are designed to evaporate the condensation with the outdoor airflow through the condensor . most air cons , including window models are designed the same way . ( i do n't like it , i think they should have the option of a drain so you can control excess more predictably -- that said we just went through some 85-90 humid days and did n't have a problem . if you are installing in a sleeve there is space in the sleeve itself usually to drill a hole away from the house or put some kind of small drain fitting to attach to a hose to pick up any excess that spills over into the sleeve . you just need to make sure the installation is not tilted in so you do n't get it coming to the inside . ) 
they are hand wash. they are so easy to clean you can use a paper towel ... i really love this set ! 
the set is ceramic . it is an eco none stick surface that is absolutely infallible . it is beautiful , functional and looks much more expensive than it is . 
no 
yes , and i love my set . it has been awesome to cook with . 
usa 
i think you may have simply cooked them on too high of heat ? 
no . great cookware set . 
yes ! that 's one of the things i really like about this cookware . the lids are interchangeable on the different size pots and fry pans . 
meyer corporation , they make other widely recognized brands as well like rachel ray , anolon , farberware ect . 
it is nonstick but i still use the spray . do not use metal utensils on inside-will scratch ! ! i am happy with the purchase . be careful with high heats will burn the ceramic 
i too have arthritis so when i lift a pot i use both hands . the pots are solid and well constructed but i would not consider them lightweight , they are certainly not as heavy as cast iron but still i can not lift with one hand . this is hard to answer because i do n't know how much your arthritis constrains your movement . they are heavier then revere ware , i think . 
i know that there are some paula deen sets that are hard-anodized . i 'm not sure about this particular set though . 
yes , it 's non-stick ceramic . it works great , too . 
i 'm sorry , please tell me is that like and electric cooktop ? if so it says in the info to use low to medium heat . i hope that helped . brenda 
120 volts . not good for wide bottom mugs . multi- purpose . also melts wax . i warmed a muffin and breakfast roll . 
yes , tehy work fine and it 's not too hot to touch the plastic sides . great warmer . 
it has 18 watts 
it has an on off slide type button on the cord , but it has no light to let you know if it is on or off . it gets very hot , and i burned my finger when i first tried it as it was on when i took it out of the box . i plugged it in and read the directions and when i went to pick it up my finger hit the hot part `` ouch '' when i turn it on i usually have to click more than once for it to come on , i have to wait a minute and put a drop of water on it to see if it is hot , it it 's not i click again and do the same thing , i have found that if i click it twice it usually comes on . i would not recommend this one . before i bought it i asked a ? to see if it had rubber feet on the bottom , and someone answered that it did ... it does not ! i have found that a lot of times there are reviews for several different models by the same company in the same comment section , so it 's best to type the exact name of the product and any other info needed to recognize it so if someone answers a question it is for your model . 
there 's definitely a red light when the switch is turned on . 
i have no idea how hot it gets , i just know it keeps my coffee mug nice and hot & # 128522 ; . sorry i could n't be of more help ruth 
it 's about 3 1 2 inches in diameter . we never had a problem with larger mugs . 
yes . it does n't get that hot . 
works fine for a tumbler , not too hot . 
it has an off and on button 
ive had this for about two years and it still glows.. the thing is that i lived in a basement room with no windows ( which may be why they glow so bright ) and all it needs is light from any light bulb to make it glow . ill turn on the lights from my room and then when im ready for bed ill turn off the lights and it feels like im floating in a bunch of stars . now i gave the bedroom to my nephews and they love it . i still have some leftover stars and theyre still glowing . now i have a room with two windows and i have blackout curtains to go with them and the stars still shine bright . ill never regret buying this product . i love it . 
there very easy to peel of the wall does n't leave residu and it does n't mess up your paint problem is that there so many that it 's gon na take a long time to take off ! 
the color is fluorochromatic 
green 
probably . they are so awesome . 
dont even waste your money on this product . i thought they were going to be exactly like the picture . they are only little green stickers like the ones we had when we were kids . 
the stickers are pale green and can be readily seen on a contrasting paint color such the dark blue in the sellers image . on a white ceiling there are still very easy to see but much less intrusion on your vision . 
hi lepilleur , this picture is made up of many set of small decals . offer some details for you reference : c:328*3.4*3.4cm . show : desigh type : c ; decal size : 3.4*3.4cm . quantity : 328pcs 
i got the king size spread and the shams fit king size bed pillows . this is a great set ! 
the bedspread you are referring to is 100 per cent polyester . 
since i did not need them , i can not remember if there are matching curtains or shears . i dont think so , but i am not positive . sorry . 
the burgundy border go all the three way around . sorry the width is not 102. thanks . 
102 '' is the length and 92 '' is width . thanks . 
diameter 8.5 '' ; inside pot 5.25 '' ; strainer ( inner basket ) 4 '' deep by 7.75 '' diametr ( will handle 1 lb . macaronie ) 
the provided instructions state this can cook up to 3 3 4 white rice yielding 8 cups cooked . hope that helps . i 've used mine several times a week since getting it and love it ! 
yes . i only cook brown rice in mine.i cook a cup of brown rice once a week every week . cooks it wonderfully . the cooker has held up nicely . would highly recommend ! 
no king size will fit a queen but will still need a bed skirt 
yes . i treat it like any laundry of similar color . it does n't lose shape or shrink . 
it is a irregular king size and even the calking is the same . i am sorry we do n't have calking size . i suggest you 'd better be sure it fit well before purchase . thanks . 
the size is incorrect for usa . but if you put it on your bed with the tag hanging from side ways it fits perfect . that is what i do on my bed that is a queen , but bought the kibg . it is very nice 
it came with king shams and i am not at our house where it is so i ca n't give you the dimensions . 
as i remember - no lines on the jigger . it 's about 1 ounce or standard size ... 
yes , holes let the beverage flow but none of the ice . 
yes 
hi there , it is a 1 oz + 1 2 oz . thank you for the question . regards , stuart 
no this is not an insulated shaker it works like it should but condensation will appear on the outside so wiping it down before a pour allows you to not add excess water to a good drink 
if you fill it to the brim it holds about 2 1 2 cups or 20ozs . i fill it halfway with ice then add the liquids usually a jigger and a half of equal parts so it makes the right size cocktail . hope that helps ; d 
very durable , used it about 100 times since i bought it . there are a few minor scratches but does n't effect the performance . 
the shaker i received , the strainer is built into the lid , it 's one piece . when you shake it , there 's a lid that fits over the strainer.. it 's a very snug fit ... .no spilling ! 
no 
yes 
yes 
yes 
not worth it . package itself was not good and the regulator was broken.. dont go for it.. 
i bought this pressure regulator because it was advertised as fitting all presto models . well , it sure does n't fit mine ! 
assembled , they seem to be pretty sturdy . we bought two for displaying legos . they are 12 '' deep , so as long as the depth is there in your closet , i do not see any major issues . be sure to secure them to the wall securely ... they come with anchors , but they are designed to be loose . 
# 2 is fixed at 30 '' ... # 1 is adjustable from 14 '' to 19 '' 
the dimensions are 19 '' ( width ) x 11 .5 '' ( depth ) x 71.25 ( height ) . 
19 '' 
mine is loaded with cookbooks and research books . oh , and there 's hardware to attach it to the wall , so it 's very sturdy . 
it is 11 & 3 8 inch deep 
yes you can , 
they are actually the same item , so there is no difference . 
i believe it was just a screwdriver and a hammer 
yes , definitely . it 's a very sturdy bookshelf . 
the actual size of the bookcase is : 71 inches tall ; 19 inches wide and 11 1 2 inches deep . this is the actual , literal size of the bookcase . i like it , it 's pretty sturdy . the back of the bookcase is basically cardboard however , but it does match in color . 
this is very sturdy and well made not flimsy at all so yes is my answer 
in my opinion no . the material of the wood probably wont hold the paint on there 
i used a drill slowly so it would n't damage the wood but you can use a screwdriver too . it could take more time and it might make your wrist hurt after a while . you also need a hammer to nail the back wall . overall , it was n't difgicult at all . it may be a bit heavy to place the pieces together but i was so excited to finish that i went for it by myself . if you have an extra hand that would be nice but not necessary . 
i use it for books but it could hold at least 130 front faced dvds . you could lay some on side on top of the others and add more . 
yes , mine came with a detailed set of assembly instructions . 
12 '' x 18 '' x 72 '' 
11.5 x 19 x 71.2 inches 
have the bookcase on the carpet and it is filled with encyclopedias . i am very satisfied with the product . 
we thank you for your interest in south shore furniture . the tools required to assemble the furniture are a hammer , a standard screwdrive and either a phillips ( star ) or a robertson ( square ) screwdriver . we do not suggest to us a powered screwdriver 
all the shelves , except for one , are adjustable in height . so there is no problem accommodating tall binders . the depth is sufficient for large three-ring binders , so they sit pretty much flush with the edge of the shelves . 
i 'm sure it could . it is made of pressed board with a nice white finish . you may have to sand it a little or put on a primer coat , especially if changing color . i am very happy with the one i bought . 
all sides are finished . and has a wood case . makes it easy to mount.. i mounted it under the stand on a 70 '' big screen . works very well , good sound 
the dimensions are : width : 19 inches x height : 12 1 2 ) 
no 
height is 25-3 8 inches ; depth is 11-3 8 inches ; width is 17-1 2 inches . this is free space , not board to board . 
external width 19 '' 
i think just that if there are pictures of books , decorative pieces , etc . in the advertisement that those items do n't come with the bookcase . 
to tell the truth i was given no instruction on how to assembly it , i used a phillips head and a small hammer . and good luck getting any help from the company . as to the product it is great and for it i have no complaints 
all the shelves are adjustable except for one that is permanently fixed so you are able to change the height of them . the shelves adjust by moving the pegs they sit on to the appropriate holes that you want and then the actual shelf rests on top of them . for this reason , turning the entire unit onto it 's side would n't really work as the shelf itself has no way to remain secure that way and it would just fall over . 
19 '' 
dimension is ok. 12 screws are neede , but there were 9 screws in the package . 
in case it falls , mine did , there is a safety strap . it cleans reasonably well , but some streaks will be seen . they say wipe them off with a cloth ! how do you get to it ? ? ? ? 
winbot uses a motor to generate suction , that is how it stays on the window . if you use winbot on a window above ground level , there is a safety pod to attach for added safety . 
the adaptor is 100 - 240v ~ 50 60hz 1.6a 
it requires your window to have a minimum size and it is only design for glass cleaning , so i do n't think it can help you . on top , this machine has serious reliability issue and is not comparable to a robot vacuum cleaner . my advice is do n't buy it at all 
i 'm near the water , but do n't have actual salt on the windows . but they were awfully dirty . i 'm talking dirt , spiderwebs , the lot . and the winbot got them clean , although it took a couple of passes . you might have to wipe a spot to get it to stick when you put it on . mostly it goes forward , so the wet pad will get to the dirt and salt before the suction pads . it does occasionally back over a dirty spot , though , so salt crystals might not be the best thing for the pads . 
winbot should not be used in temperatures below 40 degrees f or if it is raining ( or snowing , of course ! ) . 
you need to clean the pad for every window if u just clean is once per month . if the suction get stuck due to too much dust on the pad , it might fall off . this item has major reliability issue , do n't buy . i returned it for fixing 2 times in 6 months while i only used twice in between . do n't buy 
winbot is square so it works best on square shaped windows . having said that , it can clean a trapezoidal shaped window but it will not be able to fit into the corners . 
yes , it will . depending on where your electrical outlet is , you may need an extension cord . 
i think so but you would need a transformer . the problem is that the winbot has some plastic buttons and it breaks 
scroll down the page to : product dimensions : 11.5 x 19 x 71.2 inches ; 49 pounds 
71.25 inches tall , 11.5 inches deep , and 19 inches wide . 
probably . i actually turned 2 on their sides to make a daybed with storage , so i do n't know about standing them up on carpet . i can tell you they are heavy . i think if you assembled as instructed and maybe added a little wood glue in the joints , you 'd be fine . 
nicely made . great for the price . there is only one fixed shelf in the middle . the top of the fixed shelf is about 30 inches from the floor . the other three shelves are adjustable . two above it and one below . it is 11 1 2 inches deep . nicely made , but would suggest attaching it to wall with hanger that comes with it , so it does n't tip over ... especially on carpet . aloha ... . 
as stated in the product description , the width is 19 inches ( outside dimension ) . 
the inside shelf spaces are approximately 11 3 4 deep by 16 3 4 wide . comes with 3 adjustable shelves . the shelf you can.t move is a little over 2 feet from the bottom . also the bookcase comes with per drilled holes on both sides , so you could add a shelf if you buy or make one from wood . hope that helps ! 
it 's not a blender dude . 
when we used it we filled it up pretty much all all the way so it did n't swish around . if you were to only fill it up half way or something then it probably would a little 
we poured booze into measuring cup then into sunscreen container . 
i ca n't give u a simple y or n 'cause : ( 1 ) i did not try to take it aboard the plane in my carry-on & ( 2 ) re the suitcase i checked , the `` thing '' was empty as i did not fill it until i arrived in south america where i filled it prior to boarding the cruise ship ( which does not allow `` spirits '' 2 b brought on-board . it went through the ship 's version of tsp just fine because they did not do a full body scan nor a pat down and it was in my jacket pocket & i was not required to send my jacket through the scanner . nevertheless , i thick the quality of the `` thing '' looks fine & i had no problem with any leakage , so i plan to use it again and again . suggestions : put the `` thing '' in your carry-on & not on your carry aboard luggage as i do n't think it would make it through an airport tsp check , which only allows a max of 4 oz ; consider filling it only 1 2 full to minimize any loss due to discovery ; wait to fill it until u r at your destination & not boarding a plane but rather a cruise ship or attending a concert or whatever , and do n't put it in your backpack which is more likely to be searched than your jacket or crotch or whatever . hope this helps a tad . abe 
a little over 5 shots . one shot is equivalent to 1.5 ounces . the bottle holds 8 ounces . 
17.5mm or approx . 11 16 inch 
hard to say . it might , just . the containers are pretty small and they taper at the top and bottom . 
yes 
yes 
they are super easy to clean . i just use hot water and rinse , wipe out . they come clean very easy . 
the molds have a flat spot on the outside . 
it is made in china . the silicone is high quality . it has a very good feel and weight . 
i 'm sure you can , it would have to be a small piece of lemon ... .. 
third bullet of the description : `` professional quality - safe fda approved food grade , silicone ice ball '' . silicone items in general never contain bpa because they are rubber , not plastic . 
i tried filling it just short of the top allowing for expansion . however it still creates the split line . dont think it is avoidable . 
i 'm not sure i have used them in mixed drinks and they work really well unless you have a water softener that might be the reason is the only thing i could think of sorry i could n't help more . 
18 '' from floor to top of seat 
i ca n't say for sure , i purchased them for a client . i but i would say yes , the fabric is like a micro suede . fyi- we did have a few issues attaching the legs . one actually broke and we had to have replacement parts sent . they have a great look but if they are going to be used by kids or larger adults , buyer beware . 
dimensions are in the product description , these chairs are very comfortable and plenty plush enough for long board , card games or for sitting around the table and visiting . extremely pleased with this product . 
i did , but they should come with adjustable things on the bottom of the legs.. to make them higher or lower .. 
no , i do n't think so . sorry 
chair is not good quality not sturdy seat part very small 
the wood is on the darker side .

the nozels are all different . if i remembered correctly , amazon had a few suggestions after i placed the torch in my basket . i went for the same brand so there wo n't be any mistakes . better safe than sorry and it also had great reviews . 
sorry , they are suitable for the iwatani torch . it is a push and twist to hook it up . 
well , it works with my iwatani torch . not sure if you have same model ... if there 's more than one . 
i use them on my iwatani food torch ! works to perfection . 
yes 
i am well please this works very well 
no 
chef master butane fuel for use in portable gas stoves 
i have n't used mine yet but if'n it 's not for my torch , i 'm in big trouble . i bought it along with the torch head from the same outfit so i 'xpect it works great . i do know that that one i use for my camp stove is entirely different from this one . i 'd suggest going to the iwatani website or call them with the name of the torch head and get exact details . cheers ! 
i think you can use bu6 . i do n't recall just which one i used to use , but mine is an old cassette-feu and it uses the bu6 just fine . great for our bananas foster ! 
you can squeeze 9 in there if you pack them on their sides . i just tried it . that is without ice . of course the bag will keep them cold for a while . 
i usually use hot water and dawn detergent . you could use bleach on the inside but i personally would worry about discoloring the fabric on the outside with bleach 
no this particular model does not come with outside pockets . sorry !

hi bruce , it 's super-easy , definitely easier than changing a printer toner cartridge . it takes less than 30 seconds to do , and there 's zero mess to deal with . 
dear mr. hunter : i have forwarded your question to the manufacturer 's email . however , i can tell you that in darkness , only a faint blue glow is visible from the seam of the reaction chamber on my unit , which i think is a good feature because it allows me to visually verify that the light source is operating normally . i am sure you will hear from airocide directly on this matter shortly , as well . when i bought mine , i emailed them with a couple of questions and they got back to me that same day . jks 
yes , mine came with a loop 
the cotton lining can be fully pulled out of the rubber part of the mitt so that it can be cleaned on the inside . when you do this , it remains permanently stitched to the rubber part of the mitt , but the insides are completed pulled out and inverted . the label on the inside says `` wipe clean with a damp cloth or hand wash cold , do not bleach , lay flat to dry '' . i bet you could get away with machine washing it , but i 'm yet to give it a try . 
about 14.75 inches 
a single one 
no . i have looked at it again and it just has an anti-slip pattern on the surface . 
it is on the inside black lining , right next to the label . 
though it is technically made for the right hand , yes it can be used on either hand . i ordered two and the only difference is one hand has the logo on the top and the other has it on the bottom . the protection is equal regardless of which hand you wear it on . 
i have small ladies hands , too . they are a wee bit loose , but they work just fine ( for me ) . they are nice and long and that is a good thing . ; ) 
yes it is . 
yes , also great product . 
i 've only had the solofll sologrind for about a month . i pull the front assembly once a week and clean out the coffee ground build-up . have n't had any clogging issues at all . 
yes , or grind as much as you need . 
hi keyla ! i 'm not sure if you can use a rivo pod with this grinder . what i do know is that it does come with a large capacity plastic bin . you can utilize this bin to keep large amounts of ground coffee to use as you need it . so , in essence you could use a rivo pod in a round about indirect way ... .lol ! ! ! : -d 
yup , same as mine ! mine fills just below the brim which is manageable ( for me ) . i guess you need to call the manufacturer . 
i 'm not sure what you mean ? if the gounds cup is in place properly , there should be no way for coffee to spill out . one warning though . if you use flavored beans , they have oils on them that cause the grounds shoot to clog up quickly . my husband did not realize the shoot was clogged and burned up my motor trying to grind through a clogged shoot . 
i dont seem to have that problem , set at 1 for k cup or 2 for vue 
yes ! works great with one issue . we have the little brown greed red plastic ones . ( not metal ) they do give you one of theirs though ( a little better design too ) . the issue is that this grinder always grinds too much , even on setting `` 1 '' . so you have to stop it manually after 5 6 seconds . if you do n't mind that , it 's a lot easier than refilling those from a bag . 
if it was supposed to come with it thrn either return it or call the vendor and they will send one . otherwise u can order one separately on amazon or at bed bath and beyond 
no matter which coarseness you select with the switch , you will get a certain amount of finely powdered coffee . i 've never tried it , but i would n't doubt if the grind could be adjusted so the entire grind is super fine . the resulting coffee would have to be used in a machine with a different filter system though , because the mesh screen in the solofill cups would allow too much to pass through and you 'd end up with a lot of sediment in your coffee . 
it 's a little brush used for cleaning the grinder . 
the rod fits standard 5 ' tub enclosures . that is 58 '' - 60.5 '' long , usually . 
i returned it . it did n't fit my 46 3 4 '' space . 
the ends `` screw '' to put tension on the wall . it is not spring loaded , but is a tension rod . no damage to the wall . i have had this hanging for months in the kid 's bathroom . they have not managed to dislodge it to-date . 
the curve sticks out about five to five and a half inches 
i 've only had it since june , 5 months , but so far it looks like new . 
have had mine for a year now and no rust . i am thoroughly satisfied with this great product . was completely as advertised ! 
about 5 7 8 inches wide & 4 inches long . 
no it is n't a double tension rod . it connects together-just snap together to make 1 long shower rod . 
ours is 58.5 tile to tile , it fits fine . i 'm pretty confident you 'll be fine . 
yes , that 's how we have it installed and it 's been holding up very well , even when i use it as a drying rack for my jeans ! i worried at first but now treat it as i would any shower rod ... 
however , it came without a lid so i was not able use and i was denied a return.. waste i money . 
as per the description replacement carafe * fits models 49980 , 49980z , 49983 , 49984c iption 
yes it is a 12 cup carafe and works great 
yes , it 's exactly like the original . 
sorry , that 's not the model i have so i 'd only be guessing 
we have two elderly dogs and at different points , we had one with a poop accident and the other track it on tile , carpet , and wood floors and i used the sonic duo to clean all three areas relatively easily . one dog also threw up a lot one night and the stains were so bad i feared we 'd have to get new carpet , but the sonic duo got took care of that mess too . one of the stains we had to go over again the next day , but now you ca n't even see where it happened . for cleaning the carpet with deep staining , we used the carpet pad with the long nap , followed by the carpet pad with the short nap . i do n't know if that 's how we were supposed to use the pads , but it worked great . ( i know it sounds like we have poorly trained dogs , but they are good dogs . they are just elderly and struggled through an unseasonably cold winter . ) 
i received 3-hard floor cleaners 1-hard wood floor polisher 1-carpet stain scrubber 1-carpet cleaning pad pads are suppose to be rinsed right after use before you wash them in the washer . the manual states they will need replaced after 20 uses . 
it cleans everything ... excellent job , surprised us 
it comes with six pads total , two pads for each type of cleaning ( polishing , wood floors , and carpet . ) it also comes with a small bottle of each solution . the small bottles are concentrate and when mixed with water , it will fill the big bottle three times or so . 
i think it depends on how deeply set the grout is . it cleaned the grout in my kitchen very nicely but in a couple of the other rooms , the tile is thicker and the machine does n't seem to get down into the grout as well . if your grout is level to your tile , it will work very well . 
the best thing is you get a new pad with every refill bottle so with several pads i can change it when it gets dirty from each time i use the machine . you just throw dirty pads in washer and they are good as new . rule of thumb ... the cleaner the pad the better when washing your floors . it 's not so much how often in time but how dirty is the floor and how large the area . 
you sure can ! ! however , just a warning : if you 've got high gloss , new laminate floors like i do , it 's finicky- like , you ca n't spray too much solution , or you ca n't spray too little . if you spray too much , as you go it 'll look great , but an hour later , a film develops . i still would recc 'd this product- it has saved my back . just be mindful of how many times you press the button to release the cleaner ! i hope this helps you ! : ) 
yes you would need to vacuum first , but honestly this thing is not going to clean your carpets . 
yes , in a way . it has : low ; off ; and high . 
we have bamboo hardwood floors-does excellent job . 
25 '' x 60 '' 
on the small side for a runner . it says 24 x 60 , i did n't measure it but it seemed shorter than 60 '' and smaller than the 24 '' . 
i use it on my travertine tiles in hallway and also on hardwood floor . it does slip , especially on hardwood floors . not so much on travertine . 
24 '' x 60 ''

it just unplugs . it 's very handy though .

i really do n't know hind , i returned that damn thing . sorry i could n't help . 
not sure of exact weight but it is not heavy by any means 
i have no idea about the difference but mine leaks horribly . 
it holds 12 ounces . i just took a measuring cup and kept filling to get the answer . 12 ounces no problem tried to add a little more and it was at the top of the filling spout . hope this helps . 
i believe it comes with a 1-yr manufacturer 's warranty . my steam adjustment lever and i had to send to one of rowenta 's authorized service centers , they were unable to fix so rowenta replaced with a completely new iron . the process took about 3-4 weeks of not having an iron , but in the end they did make it right . 
i am sorry i ca n't offer you a comparison . i went for the 9280 because i iron a large variety of fabrics , and i sew as well . i have owned the iron for less than a month , but i have ironed linen , polyester chiffon , 100 % cotton ( both knit and woven ) , girl scout patches , and cotton poly blends . no leaking , no scorching . this is a big , heavy iron that ejects lots of steam , so be prepared . it glides smoothly and effortlessly . i have experienced no scorching or yucky marks transferring to the soleplate after almost a month of daily use . 
yes . more steam release to the fabric to eithe add a crease or remove a wrinkle . much improvement over the dw6080 . you wo n't be disappointed . 
extra large water tank , is 12.7 ounce water tank . same tank as the rowenta dw8080 pro master steam iron . 
hello - i love this iron . it is new for me . i do n't feel it is too heavy . i often hold it up to steam clothing vertically after i finish using the board . 
it 's ok could be better but still like the iron 
yah it will shut off of left unattended for long periods . not sure of the exact cutoff time period 
it does not appear to have a temperature setting on it but it has settings for different style fabrics which operate at different temperatures . you are also in control of how much steam comes out . 
i have not had that problem with this iron , but i did with a previous rowenta ( different model ) . i iron 5 to 6 hours a week and have not really had any major complaint with any rowenta i have had . sounds like a problem with yours . hope this helps . 
the total height is 6.25 '' , distance between shelves is 5.5 '' 
i would n't . it may turn with `` just a touch '' , if your touch is heavy . but it does n't glide , and if you find yourself forcing it , the bottles may tip . 
yes 
i believe it is more suited to lighter things like spices . can goods may be to heavy for this item , plus the amount of space between layers is not really suited to can goods in my opinion . it is a very good lazy susan , but not super heavy duty . we are quite pleased with it for lighter items . i hope this helps . 
i could n't give you an exact weight that the lazy susan can hold , but i do have them filled to capacity with a mix of glass and plastic spice containers and it turns smoothly . 
i did not receive washers , but they do n't seem to be necessary . once assembled the device worked just fine . we are very pleased with it . 
yes 
mine were labeled as made in china . 
10 inches . 
the lazy susan is 6 inches high , after assembled . the distance between the shelves is 4 and 3 4 inches . you would love the lazy susan . it looks so nice in my cabinet and makes much more room . 
the distance is 3 '' from drip spouts when inserted for function , but i used one 3 1 2 '' cup for double shot ( tip it a fraction when function complete , as you view pic , the drip spouts are 1 3 '' ) ... this is an excellent machine ! 0 problems in 18 mos . since purchase ! hope answer makes since ! great machine & white is hard to find ! 
i just tried . it does not fit a normal mug . this is an espresso machine and is designed for espresso cups . great machine . 
it 's an amazing unit , i 've used everyday for over a year , but , i do n't know the answer to your question ... ca n't you just get a connverter ? 
60 
it 's 110v 
closer to plaine white , a wee touch of beige with a pleasent luster . 
yes . it makes one or two . 
you can get double casting of coffee . 
we bought a separate tamper as well to use for our espresso making . it 's nothing fancy but does the job well . http : www.amazon.com gp product b0001xrnem ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 . we use the 50mm side ( smaller side ) and it works great ! 
as shown on the picture , the clrearance between filter and cup tray is 3 inches . jocelyne 
yes & # 65292 ; each cavity 1.6 '' round by 0.8 '' deep.thank you ! 
dear , thank you for your question . the diameter of each ball is 4cm , it is round ball , so the depth of the ball on each half of mold is 2 cm . i hope this answer is helpful to you . 
i have not tried the hard candy yet . i have assembled the two halves , piped chocolate into the hole for the stick and then inserted the stick . 
3 to 4 
yes , i filled with batter and they came out beautiful .

i weight 215-230ish works fine for me and my gf . 
no , its very firm , we do n't have a box spring , just the mattress , and it feels great . its still firm and yet soft , at the same time even after two little girls using it as a trampoline when they think we 're not watching . 
i 'd probably go u 
a bit less than 1 ounce , because a full ounce is too much ! 
they vary slight because of shapes but average about 1 3 4 '' in diameter 
yes , ship from china 
yes 
yes , you need to move the bottom tray but it fits fine . i usually make two cups of coffee on the middle setting and there 's still room for milk cream . you may have to pour out a tiny bit , but they are wonderful . tip it upside down and not a drop comes out . also , keeps the coffee hotter than most . 
the inside of the lid is hard to clean . so , i put mine in the dishwasher . eliminated the problem . hubby loves the cup . 
no . they are stainless steel . 
you can buy them separate , but this one comes as a set of 2 
screws on . it a very good travel mug , i very highly recommend it ... 
i do n't know for sure , but it looks like it is stainless steel . i know they wear well . we have some that we have had for years & they look as good as the ones we just bought . 
it is a two-pack , not individually boxed . 
china . these are great mugs and contigo stands behind their warranty . had one for more than two years and it developed a small leak after many uses . contigo replaced the top at no charge . very impressive product and company . 
the mugs are about 7 inches tall and fit perfectly on our kuerig . the mugs hold the large setting ( 12ounces ) with a little room for creamer . hope this helps ... 
yes the lids are bpa free . 
we use 100 % polyester fabric . thanks for your interest ~team idylc homes 
they 're mainly for transporting . i sometimes still use plastic bags from the store for wet vegetables . 
i do n't have the tags anymore but they are very soft and mesh-like nylon-poli combo ? i am not sure . they are great to shop with and also to store veggies in the fridge . they keep veggies fresh longer 
i believe the bags would hold the seeds . they are a very fine mesh . 
try wrapping the tag around the string so both sticky sides meet . thanks for your interest . team idylc homes 
hello christopher p. , yes we do manufacture these . how many are you looking for ? if you would like to discuss this further drop us a message either here on amazon or at our website idylchomes ( dot ) com . thank you for your interest , ~team idylc homes 
hi miriam , great question thank you for asking . we recommend that if not immediately used after 24 hours to take your fresh herbs out of the mesh bag and store them properly . the best way to store these after the market , ( particularly parsley , cilantro , oregano , sage , marjoram , basil , rosemary , tarragon , mint , and chives ) is to store them upright in a little cup of water . this idea also works for asparagus just do n't forget to snip off a little bit of the bottom . hope this helps = ) 
mesh is a good description or it can be described as a very fine soft netting that you can see through . 
no , it is a netting mesh bag . 
they do not discolor , even after heavy use . we did not use silpat , have no experience with that . 
hi bb , you can cut them if you want to , but the mats were not meant to be cut . they are very flexible , so should be able to sit well in most standard pan sizes . how large is your pan ? 
hi these mats are 100 % made of bpa-free silicone and do not contain any fiberglass . the dimensions are 16 1 8 x 11 3 4 inches so yes they should fit a bakers half sheet . 
they are very thin , about 1mm in thickness . 
hi our mats are made in china . 
without the handle - the area is 14 '' x 14 '' - with the handle it 's 22 '' x 14 '' 
hi kim , you would be fine . as other users have said , the contact is minimal to none and exposure time is very short . we have a long history of happy customers using in much hotter settings , including big green eggs at 750 - even wood fired ovens . just keep reasonably away from flame . gary @ exo super peel 
the super peel is great for all baking . i use it weekly for pizza ( you need to use so little flour on the peel it helps the flavour in my mind ) , and sour dough breads . i really ca n't imagine using a regular peel any more . as for the question of what is the best model i have only used the composite version and my single complaint is that the canvas `` belt '' drifts left and right depending on how you use it as it does not have a groove to slide in like the original wooden design . related to this design `` flaw '' the canvas is not rectangular the entire length . to slide around the handle it has two straps on the back that can creep up to the front leaving a small gap when fully pulled back . that being said whichever model you grab i think you will be very happy , it is just such a clever little tool . 
yes . it does shrink some 
yes , it 's removable . you do n't have to wash it between uses , but i usually have to because i get tomato sauce on it , etc . 
it is made of a hard smooth masonite material . no glue involved . not a partical board at all . 
when you say it has a very small opening , do you mean width or height ? obviously the opening width would be the main restriction . this peel is 14 '' wide and will work in an oven that size or larger . if you mean the height of the opening , you should be fine with any reasonable height . in fact it is easier to slide your pizza off of this peel without tipping it . so , it should be easier if height of the opening is the concern . gary @ exo super peel 
the 72 dollar model uses wood as the base . the pro uses a composite material . as for how it works , the amazon picture shows just one side . the other side has a full-length split in the cloth material so that it can straddle the handle . thus , as you slide the material forward to get the pizza onto the cooking surface the split will become visible on the pizza side of the composite peel . 
i 've used mine in a 550 degree oven with no problem . 
david , the handle does not detach . it is quite a bit stronger this way and is quite thin , so stores away readily . 
safedine baking mats are pure silicone and so are more flexible than those that use fiberglass . in our experience the safedine baking mats do n't stain as easily as the fiberglass ones do . 
i 've used it at 400 degrees f without any problems . the product description says , `` temperature resistant from 446f ( 230c ) to -40f ( -40c ) '' which i think is straight off the packaging . 
the heat resistance of the mats should be similar so i do n't think there is much difference . 
hi . it is very thin - about the thickness of a knife blade . i am not using it for its intended purpose though i imagine if you placed it on something sturdy like a cookie sheet it would work fine as a surface . 
yes , just pull out the drawer and empty it . 
yes it should . it does come with 2 ice packs keeps it a lot cooler . 
maybe it 's because you just turned it on . if you just turn it on high it will drop down to a lower speed until the water circulates and then go back up . it takes about 5 minutes . 
& lt ; 30 % is where you 'll see 10-15 degree decreases in your room . when humidity gets over 60 % , evap coolers stop working , and in fact can increase the temperature by pumping in hotter , more humid air . at 50 % humidity , you 'll only get 2-5 degree decreases . with a smaller unit like this , i doubt that you 'll notice anything above 50 % . right now in slc , ut , it just rained . humidity is about 53 % . i can feel cool air coming out of the unit , but it does n't travel more than 5-10 ft from the unit . when the humidity is the normal 20-25 % , this thing blows frigid air and cools my 200 sq ft room quite well . 
we never measured it , but we believe it is sized as advertised . it fits our standard king size bed well . ( we are not where we can measure it , sorry ) . it is very light , but very warm . we are pleased we bought it . 
yes 
hi , linda , thanks for e-mailing us ! the comforter is only available in the colors french roast ( brown ) , navy , beach grass and titanium . we also have it available in white on a different item listing . let us know if there are any other ways we can help you . have a nice day and holiday season ! cheers , j. lee 
yes but silky smooth . i like mine but i am just a guy so ... 
my comforter is a rich chocolate type color ... not prominent green at all.. 
crib mattress fits in this bed - it is a super cute bed , sturdy , safe and perfect for my son who would n't sleep in a crib after he turned 1 ! 
yes 
im a little confused by your question . we used a pillow top crib mattress which is pretty thick . once the bed is constructed the mattress sits on the floor basically . the head board is a little over a foot and a half tall while the foot of the bed is about 6-8 inches tall . if side walls are what you are concerned with for rolling off and falling out , the sides work as a bumper to prevent that . they range from aprx 8 '' to about 10-12 '' in the high points but as i stated in my review , purchase pool noodles for the top edges . slice down the center and slip over the edges . 
the box was surprisingly small ... it was heavy ... maybe 3ft 3.5ft ... .all the boards you see in the picture are not whole , each side is made of 2 small boards put together . ..a baby 's mattress for a crib fits perfectly inside ... 
basically . there are three boards and a canvas-like lining between the mattress and the floor . 
i really do n't know , but if i had to take a guess , i would say no more than a 80-90lbs child since the two slabs that support the mattress will break probably ! 
no mattress , that has to be purchased separately 
the color of the inside is blue ... and the outside is red just like you see it on the picture..suitable for a boy not a girl . 
toddlers & up . my son is 3 & it 's perfect for him . 
i weigh 150 and my son is 25 , it does set on the floor so weight isnt a huge deal . 
to answer your question specifically , no , the machine can not go flush up against the baseboard and into corners because the cleaning brushes are recessed a small distance from the front edge of the machine . there is also a small area on either side of a threshold when moving from one room to another which the machine does n't clean very well . this happens with a change from one flooring material to another ( i.e. , vinyl to tile , vinyl to wood , wood to marble ) . but , overall , these baseboard , corner and threshold areas are small enough that i can use a soft cleaning tool such as a mop or sponge , to my satisfaction . i hope this helps . judy 
the newer model is slightly larger , but weighs less than 14lbs . which is 8.3lbs . less it has 2 additional brushes which are specially designed to cover sealed hardwood floors and tile & grout . 360 clean : spinscrub technology gently washes and scrubs hard floors from all angles . wash , scrub & dry : switching between options is a snap . cleanboost control applies extra detergent to stains and heavy traffic areas . 11.5 '' removable nozzle provides a combined squeegee and suction to quickly dry . removable for easy cleaning . it uses several different hoover cleaning solutions , the hoover multi-floorplus 2x concentrated is great and you do n't need much unless the floors are a high-traffic area or very dirty . there are solutions designed for use cleaning grout and another for wood floors . i like that it leaves the floor so dry that there are no steaks and so clean that you can feel the difference with your bare feet . as i said , i did n't have the previous version , all the technical information i found on different web sites and the last is my personal opinion and observation . i have other brands that called their brands ( shark , bissell and others ) that said they were cleaners or sanitizers and all they did was much around hot , dirty water . the only difference between them and mopping is that they were easier to push around , the water remained hot , and you were not bending over to wring it out . even the ones that said they dried the floors , did not unless you went over them at least at least three times ( it varied , depending on the humidity level ) . there is nothing worse than pulling up water that is not clean after you have used the machine at least twice . it is discouraging and disgusting . that is why i love this one , it cleans using very little of the 2x solution ( a small bottle is included ) and then removes the water leaving you with a clean , dry floor without streaks . it is lightweight and i am nor writhing in pain when i finish . 
kimo , i think the machine does a good job with the grout cleaning , but i do have one extenuating circumstance . i purposely used dark gray grout when we had this tile installed . this is a high traffic area plus where we feed two dogs . when i finish cleaning the floor all of the grout lines are consistently damp which shows they have been scrubbed . i 'm satisfied . hope this helps . judy 
a water solution with brushes that can get into the cracks and crevices in my floor like nothing i 've tried before . i am very glad that i bought it ! 
the manual spesifies only hover cleaning products . http : content.abt.com documents 52884 fh40160_manual.pdf however i have used a light bleach water on tiled floors with the older model for over a year , it did not cause any problems . since vinegar is water soluble you should be fine . 
yes 
i use it on laminate . there is a hard brush head and a soft brush head . just use the soft one on the laminate . i use the hard one on a tile stone bathroom floor . love it 
it cleans the grout , but you still have to manually get on your hands and knees to clean the grout really well with a toothbrush or similar tool for really dirty grout . 
the hoover floormate works well on my indoor tiles and grout , which do n't get very dirty . it does n't work that well on my outdoor tile and grout which gets especially moldy here on the rainy side of the big island . i had to scrub my outdoor tile ( which does n't have a smooth surface , but grooves and indentations ) and grout with bon ami , and then the floormate was a big help ( i just filled the container with water - no soap ) in rinsing and picking up the dirt mold that i dislodged with my bon ami and elbow grease-powered scrub brush . 
it works beautifully on this type of floor . my kitchen , dining room , and entry hall are ceramic tile and the machine made it all look like new . 
at the highest point at the top of the pillow it is 4 inches . in the curved area it is 3.5 inches . when i press into the center of the pillow to simulate the weight of a head it flattens down to about an inch . 
hi ! using a pillowcase is completely up to you . it would not interfere with the memory foam or the pillow design . thank you , thehomeliquidator 
i get hot flashes and i sleep on this pillow . i 've not found it to be hot or somehow contribute to the hot felling i experience from time to time . hope this helps . 
i just use a normal queen sized pillow case . the pillow case molds to the pillow and has worked great . 
it is a heavy pillow ... not sure about 15 pounds tho . id say about 10 but i suppose it could be up to 15 with packaging . my husband loves it ! 
i bought a protective case that zipped . i use standard size pillow cases . they work great . 
the pillow is heavy , probably two to three times that of a regular pillow . it has the feeling of a limp wet towel , presumably because it responds to the physical pressures . do n't try adjusting the position while you are half asleep , the sensation is like dragging a reluctant kitten . it also is not particularly useful to prop a couple of pillows for reading . this is definitely a sleep pillow . hope this helps . 
look on ebay . there 's better prices there too . 
i am assuming they are made of some sort of plastic , but on the outside of the box they came in was a sign that said no bpa . hope this helps . 
have used them to mix , but mostly withnteflon or rubber utensils . 
they are not designed to withstand the `` heat '' of a microwave . i use glassware in the microwave . 
no , the colanders have small handles to lift them from the bowls . the lids fit the bowls . 
yes -- from the amazon page : pros : * 3 convenient bowl sizes ( 5.5 quart , 3 quart , 1.5 quart ) in 3 different colors , making it super easy to grab matching pieces * easy to stack pieces , both in the cabinet and in the fridge with lids on * well balanced bowls with non-slip bottoms * bowls and colanders are dishwasher safe ( see associated fyi below ) * light weight , yet sturdy , plastic ( ? ) material & bowls have tight fitting lids , making them perfect for travel and fridge storage ( see con & fyi below ) * no bpas 
large bowl is 5.5 qts , large colander is 5 qts , medium bowl & colander are both 3 qts , small bowl is 1.5 qts , and the small colander is 1 qt . 
the plastic is tough and solid . the white color outside is shiny , the bottom is covered with rubber ( stays in one place while you 're mixing ) and each bowl comes with a solid plastic strainer that fits perfectly within each bowl and better yet each bowl has a cover for left overs . if that 's not enough , everything fits together and all is dishwasher safe . i would strongly recommend this purchase . 
i have used one in them a couple of times and it does n't seem to damage it . 
no , they are not . the bottom of the bowl says not to put them in the microwave . but i do like them as mixing bowls -- and they are slip-resistant . 
the only time i use them with hot liquids is when i drain pasta . i think it would be okay with hot liquids . they are bpa free and dishwasher safe . i use them a lot and i love them . you can call oxo at ( 800 ) 545-4411 to better answer your questions . 
you could hide it behind the unit , but it all depends on your placement of the unit . mine covered my cable outlet , but my wall plug is off to the side . depending on your number of electronics , it could get full pretty quickly behind the unit if you place it over your wall outlet - depends on your cable management . 
i think it will be , the tv will extend past it . not by much . if your ok with that i think this is a great item 
im not sure as i have thrown away the box but i believe we have about 25-30 blue rays in each compartment 
yes 
i know the specific details are in the info under the description . not sure if you mean length or width . the middle is the deepest , but is separated . i got caught as i never read the info and found my table lamps that i wanted to put on the top did not fit due to the size of the shelf and shape of shades , so changed the shades which ended up being a great upgrade and went well with the new modern unit . 
if orders today it would ship on tuesday or wednesday and should arrive via ups the week of the 5th . although we can not guarantee when it will arrive once ups has possession of it . 
this is shipped from british columbia 
expresso comes in like a very dark brown ... it 's almost black 
they are listed in the product description when you scroll down . just be careful of the top shelf as it is narrower then the lower so i had to change the shape of my lamp shades which are on it as the original ones did not fit . it is very well make and attractive . the person that installed it was very impressed . very clean and contemporary looking and with the space underneath i put my pouffs 
ratchet bolts would be the best . customers would have to supply the socket set to install . but at least the bolts would n't get stripped out like the ones used now or get their hands tore up ? a couple of the bolts i installed i do n't know if i will ever be able to get them out without cutting them off if i ever had too ? but other wise we love the product ! it 's was easy to put together . the directions are easy to follow ! i got it put together in less than an hour ! the wall mount took longer than it should because of the bolts it comes with . i hope this helps . 
ours is 14 in from floor , and our tv is securely mounted to wall . if you go any higher it would be uncomfortable to watch tv 
12.5 inches deep x 57 inches wide excluding ends . ( 58 3 16 including side panels ) 
it is made to do either . i mounted tv up a little higher on wall so i could accomodate a sound bar . 
i ca n't advise on 2 studs and 2 anchors . i would be nervous about it . 
as long as you secure it to studs it will be plenty sturdy . i have a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old . not to say they can use it as a monkey bar , but a little light tugging or rearranging of my alphabetized blu-rays is n't gon na bring it down . 
9 series more compact and looks thinn4 
the $ 109 version is only 48 '' and not 58 '' . it only has two divided sections instead of three divided sections that come with the 58 '' 
18 wide 12 deep to front of vertical dividers . will def fit 
it is 13 inches deep 
black 
the chair itself is a darker brown similar to chocolate . the cording is a creamish tan color . it is a good looking chair 
it reclines all the way . 
my son is 6'4 '' and has reclined in this chair . i am very pleased with this chair but it is difficult to `` kick '' footrest back from reclining position for me . 
to glide you do n't have to give it much more than 6-8 inches tops and its a nice glider . to recline i 'd say the at least 2 1 2 to 3 ft from a wall . we bought two of them to sit side by side in front of our fire place . one of the best online purchases we have ever made . love these chairs . 
not sure but i 've had two people in it 350 pounds total ... very sturdy . 
it 's pretty big , i will have to check the measurements but it can easily fit a 300 lb person . 
it is a micro fiber . 
the back locks in place . it will take a couple people working in concert to get it apart , not easy . but those same people could turn it on its side and move it around a corner 
the seat is approximately 23-inches wide from the inside of each armrest . the depth is approximately 18.5-inches . 
from the floor to the top of the chair is about 41 '' . the back cushion itself is about 27 '' . 
not super far . we have a small room that it 's in and i do n't feel like it sticks out or looks awkward . 
it reclines to about a 45 degree angle . it is very comfortable . it glides and is quiet and gentle . you can not glide and recline at the same time . 
yes , it 's microfiber . it cleans really easily ! ( so far , anyway . we 've been using it for eight months ) 
i thought this would be an issue for me but i honestly have n't even thought abt having an ottoman since ive been using the chair . it 's pretty easy and comfortable to rock and glide without one . 
i 'm 5'2 '' and do not touch the floor when sitting all the way back in the chair . 
all the way up 
more like slate dark gray . i love this recliner . 
yes . this chair has a rocking motion , not gliding . so it swivels , rocks , and reclines . 
it 's about 25-26 inches . 
it does recline pretty far back . i think it would be comfortable to sleep in if you really wanted to . 
no 
it 's really a glider that rocks , so it does both 
no , it does not . 
it is obvious . i have a chocolate brown and mine meshes better but i love the chair so much i got over the base . i would consider painting it if you go with a light color . 
on the side there is a plastic peice you pull .. 
19 inches 
yes , the back reclines and the feet come up- you can lay completely flat 
i am not sure how to remove the back but since it had to be assembled ( put on ) when i got it , it should be fairly easy to disengage . there are instructions with the chair . 
i do n't know what ther specified weight i it is , but i have 2- 300 plus individuals sitting in the chair - no problem 
27 '' high 
yes it is . 
i just filled a bowl with water and set my mike for 3 min.the bowl is to hot to touch were the water is but is grab-able were the water is n't . the water is very hot . i guess its what you would normally expect . 
china ... ... ... ... ... .and the quality is not very good 
absolutely ; put them in microwave often . 
they have n't yet , and all the plates and bowls have been through the dishwasher numerous times . i 'm reasonably careful , but i have n't been able to avoid banging edges occasionally , since often i 'm all thumbs , and not a chip yet . 
no 
7 + 3 4 inches across and holds 2.5 cups of water 
indeed they do ! 
they are labeled dishwasher and microwave safe as far as being oven safe goes i 'm not sure . 
the salad plate has a diameter of 8 1 4 '' across . 
yes i have used them in the microwave and dishwasher and they still look good as new . i love these dishes 
yes . very dark finish inside cups . 
these are a chinese knock-off . the quality is poor . i do not believe there are any matching pieces beyond what comes in the standard place setting itself . 
sorry , i returned these task soon as i got it . the first few dishes i took out of the box were scratched and i figured , if they scratch that easily in the box , how will they look after a couple of months of real use ? 
yes , that is what i have . i figured i was taking a chance buying the salt plate holder , but although it 's a bit cumbersome because of the thick block , it does fit . 
though we have n't tried it , we were told by the woman in the cooking store where we bought this that it could go in the oven . it is metal though , so you will have to use hot pads to hold it and get it out of the oven . for what it 's worth , this cost $ 16 in that cooking store ... i 'm not sure why this seller has it priced so high . 
the size listed is not correct ( 15 '' x 9 '' x 1.5 '' ) . the actual dimensions are 12 '' x8 '' . i purchased 2- 8 '' x 6 '' x 2 '' blocks and they fit perfectly . 
yes . fits well . 
it will it just will not be a tight fit but it will work . 
yes 
fits 12 x 8 x 2 perfectly . 12 x 8 x 1.5 would work as well . any smaller on length and width would have tray sticking out . 
yes it will fit in this holder . 
no . your block is too small . at your size your salt risks breaking so the holder wo n't be able to support it . 
8.5 x 12 inches , very sturdy with some cross bars in the center . 
most importantly , in addition to the other answers provided ( larger feed tube , different handle design , slightly different look ) , the 8006 is made in s korea and the 8008 is made in china . s korea is best known for its superior manufacturing of the motors for juicers . both have the same warranty from omega so this should not matter , but it is a difference . 
there are quite a few , including plates for pasta extrusion and peanut butter . the basic accessories include the juice collection cup and the pulp collection cup , a cleaning brush , and a `` pusher '' for pushing the cut vegetables down the chute . i ca n't remember them all . for full information , i suggest that you either go to omega 's website or check out this great specialty retailer site http : www.discountjuicers.com . they have not only product information but also videos showing you how to use the product . 
i have the 8008 and i love it i use it for both whetgrass and juicing . it is very easy to clean i think the 8007 and 8008 mods are very similar because they use the same parts 
i ca n't attest to its durability since i do n't use it commercially . but do note that it is slow ( by design ) to extract the most out of leafy greens . so if you are using this for production purposes , you may find it to be too slow . 
the pulp collects in a separate container than the juice . the juice is without pulp but yes it would be easy to put some back in . 
finish is stainless steel . masticating parts are heavy duty plastic - there are no blades . all high quaity materials . harder items such as carrots cantelope kale & grasses extract best they extract with little to no pulp residual in juice . 
i have personally never seen any seeds in my juice through this juicer , but the only things i have juiced with seeds are pears , cucumber , apples , lemons , grapes , and oranges . maybe another reviewer has more to add ? 
yes , i love my omega , it juices everything 
120 v 200w and it runs off a 15 amp breaker effortlessly . best juicer i have ever used or seen . i love it 
super quiet ! ! i use it while my 2 year old sleeps . my mom has the brevel and it 's way noisier . 
the newer 8007 8 model is bpa-free , while the 8004 6 is not . the 1st stage of the 2-stage screen sieve is made of steel in the 8007 8 series , while in the older model it 's plastic . guess you could say the new model is more `` heavy duty '' and would be less prone to screen damage in the long run . all in all , the 8007 8 is an upgraded version of the 8004 6 but the upgrades are more subtle than earth-shattering : http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=bvznijwgw2i 
this is a problem with amazon . they force sellers to use prefomatted ads . amazon is a very controlling format to work with . i suspect that at one time as a special omega had the grass growing kits as a christmas promotional . a lot of these probably sold and amazon made this ad there standard format for everyone to use . i am sure the grass kits no longer come with the item ... ... ... .but getting amazon to change the ad ... ... ... ... ... ... .well we all just have better things to do than spend 8 to 10 hours trying to get them to change something . 
hello , the feed tube is actually the same size . 
hi richard , the omega 8007 does include a 15 year warranty when purchased from an authorized retailer . the only color juicers that we 've seen with staining issues are those that are white . beets and carrots will over time cause some discoloration on white juicers ( though not all ) . we have yet to see any discoloration on silver , black or chrome juicers to date . please let us know if you have any other questions . thanks harvest essentials 
yes , my screen had a piece of loose wire on one side and started to come apart quickly . also the part of the `` open '' `` close '' print on the machine wiped off when cleaning . 
you do get some pulp . this juicer is excellent at squeezing everything out of your veggies . you get so many enzymes and vitamins out from your squeezed , high quality juice that pulp is not necessary or needed . the juice goes right into your bloodstream . you can get all the pulp you want from a blender and your nutri bullet . you get different results . juice utilizes more veggies and gets absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and a smoothie with pulp does n't utilize many veggies and goes to your stomach to be digested . i do n't suggest putting the dried pulp back in cause your extracted juice has everything you need ... .even fiber . 
the 8007 and 8008 are made in china . amazon offers their warranty on all products , regardless of the warranty they already carry . please ignore amazon 's offer as the omega is already covered by the manufacturer 's warranty . thanks , mike - coolshinystuff 
hi there , this item is a us model that is not designed for use outside of n america on power other than 110 volt . we encourage you to purchase the 220 volt version of this juicer , however , that unit is not currently available as the manufacturer is back ordered for the next 90 days . note use of the 110 volt unit on 220 volt power will void the warranty . we currently do not support shipping this item outside of the us at this time . 
yes , though mine is slightly different from the picture . the `` handle '' on top , feed tray , and end cap are black . 
yes plus nut butter and noddles ! 
approximately 18 '' x 14 '' x 5.5 '' 
yes , it is hard plastic . i have been using mine for about a year and it is holding up like a true champ . for the price it was a winning purchase . mine still looks just like new . hope my comments helped . margaret 
no holes in the bottom . drainage is a problem . water is held in the bottom and has to be tipped out when you are done . depending on what you are doing , it might overflow the ridge around the edge . also the lower layer is level and the water does not drain down the lip on one side . 
i did not really understand your question , which was a bit confusing ; but i would say , if you are asking what i believe it is , the overhang of the dish rack with the drainer is about 1 inch . it works just fine with no problems . 
i do n't quite remember , because i sent it back . however , i ended up ordering this one ( http : www.amazon.com gp product b004ircdgu ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 ) , and it is a bit bigger , and fits my dishes very well . it measures 21 x 15 x 6 inches . so , the one we are commenting on is slightly smaller than that . 
no it works percetly for my needs . 
yes it can . easy cleaning once rack is removed from the pan . 
the top mounting plate dimensions are 3 '' x 1 15 16 '' 
i placed them on the 2 end and 1 center support in the center of each slat . this was the recommendation from simmons in order to comply with the new warranty . its very easy to install and took a matter of minutes 
you need more slats . bite the bullet , go to lowes or home depot and buy some 1 x 3 oak slats , i have 4 all total . with the t-bar i recommended and one of the bed claws , you will be fine . 
it 's only one piece . 
if you have wooden crossbars to screw them into , then yes . would be difficult impossible to attach to metal . hope this helps . 
i would assume so as long as you put wooden slats under the base . 
no ... .you have to attach theses to the wood slats than run across the center ( underneath ) the box spring . these can not support the center of the mattress if you merely put them around the perimeter frame of the box spring . 
yes ! very sturdy and easy to use . 
i do n't remember this , but i used it with a `` platform '' bed that uses a series of slats rather than a box springs . i affixed the claw to a piece of 4 foot square plywood that i then screwed into several of the slats and this worked well for me . 
yes this is perfect replacement for the wood sticks . it is best to screw it on the wood slabs . yet another cost effective method is to buy a thick piece of wood and cut into 3 pieces with similar height of your original wood sticks . another is to put stacks of hardback book under each slab to hold it up . 
the cord storage compartment is 10 1 4 x 2 1 4 inches , the front compartment for brushes , etc. , is 6 3 4 x 4 inches , the blow dryer insert is 2 3 4 inches , the curling iron insert is 1 3 4 inches , and the flattening iron insert is 2 1 4 x 2 1 4 inches . 
the organizer does not have a power strip attached , but one could be installed on the base or inside the cord storage bin . most homes do not have an electrical outlet inside the vanity cabinet , but you could have an electrician install one . 
you can wrap them or use the available slot in the front to store them , which is what we do with ours . 
it is n't very wide- we ended up putting ours in the longer slot on the side . still love this product though , extremely well built . 
the 9 1 2 includes the base , i love this product ! 
hello jb , the organizer has 3 steel inserts for hot appliances , one for a hair dryer , one for a curling iron , and one for a flattening iron . 
hello carolyn , the dimensions of the organizer are 18 3 4 inches long or deep , 9 1 2 inches wide and 7 inches tall . allow enough room for tall appliances like curling irons , 17 or so inches . 
thanks for your question , this item is currently unavailable- we do n't know when or if this item will be back in stock . as such , we can not predict what the cost would be should we receive this item in the future . i hope this helps ! 
the organizer has a clear finish applied , it is not possible to stain it although it could possibly be painted . 
can you paraphrase the answer you received ? i want to know too : - ) 
yes it is ! 
hi mark ! we can definitely ship to canada . have you already placed an order ? if so , please let me know the order number and i can see which stage your mug is in ! cheers , ian 
hi ! we do not remove startup vitamins from our products . best , jason 
no it does n't . it also has a small logo on it for some company . 
i would n't know it was never shipped to me .. very disappointed in that company 
i would n't . i 've gone through 2 covers in less than a year . one to the wash and one to wear and tear . the fabric and seams are horrible . 
i do n't know what are you talking about it ? i did n't say anything . it is great . my granddaughter love it.. oh well my husband and i noticed that real small couch for expensive price . whoa . that cost should be forty dollars.. 
best for children 4 or younger 
34 inch length for child to lay upon . not including the back rest . 
not sure what you mean ? but i like it a lot it 's fast and on 110 
china 
no . the only plastic inside is the little filter in the spout , you can remove it . even at full water limit it does n't touch it anyway . 
its 110 , for usa . 
plastic 
whats wrong with the voltage where you live.i have no problem using my own in my house.so why wo n't you ship to singapore 
i bought in us . it 's 120v - 60 hz - 1400w 
no ... this can use on only 110v . 
sorry for the delay of answering your question . this was made in china . 
you really need to order the hario more substantial paper filters for this pour over coffee dripper . this happened to me when i ran out of the filters that come with the cone and used melitta . this should be stated on the product information before you purchase ! 
4 inches diameter at solid flat base . 4.45 inches diameter at the opening . a good solid item . 
i used a size four melita and folded it . worked fine for less money 
i have a metal filter and it 's much too small for this . if you have a metal filter that is about the same size as a two cup paper filter ( the top of your filter should be no more than 4 inches across ) , then it will probably work , but most metal filters are designed for four cups . 
it does n't seem 6 '' tall , i 'm surprised that 's what it measures at . the size is about the same . the kuissential might seem bigger because the glass is thicker than the plastic melitta one and it is round , compared to melittas triangle-shaped one . i have both and prefer the kuissential , the only downfall when comparing the two is that the filters for the kuissential can not be bought in any store ( i 've looked everywhere in my area ) and the melitta filters are carried everywhere . 
yes , but it will not save you from the poor choices you wake up with . 
not sure , it 's well made . you do have to follow the directions carefully . the way it is made , you must pour the hot water 'around ' the coffee grounds , not directly on the coffee . or you will break the filter . once you get the hang of it you will love it . until then , it will make you mad . i think the way it 's designed , you use less coffee .. 
the diameter of the base is 4 inches . 
not sure what u mean but i use size 2 filter paper filters . this is good for one cup size . good quality too . 
not for what you are wanting . its for three video devices ( bluray player , xbox , ps4 , etc ) and allows you to switch between the three to view on one screen . but i had no luck with this product . like many others complaints i have read , it came to me faulty . i sent it back . 
it really does not work very well , i have to switch manually every time . sometimes it might work but it depends on what type of devices you are connecting , because as long as i could realize , this works checking the voltage a device send to the unit and then it switch . if no voltage or all devices are sending a sending a voltage signal , it will no switch . that 's the problem : 
try one of your hdmi and back if your tv and let me now if it work 
i used it in the other direction , with multiple devices into one tv input . maybe there are hdmi settings in the tvs that will make the cable automatically switch so you do n't have to get up and click the switch each time . 
i 'm using it to combine sources into one tv input , so i ca n't be positive it works the other direction , but i would guess so . it does a good job of automatically detecting sources and switching to the device that is putting out video . my only complaint is the blue led indicator never turns off . 
automatic switching never worked for me , and i do n't believe there 's an . option to turn it on or off . 
the chair will accommodate larger person . the base cushion is about 22 '' deep and 24 '' wide . however the arms can adjust outward to about 36 '' wide . the side arm also adjust up and down . i would say a person 300+ lbs and a heath up to 6 ' 5 '' would find this chair comfortable ... 
seat size : 22.75 '' w x 20.5 '' d back size : 21.5 '' w x 27.5 '' h seat height : 20 - 24.25 '' h 
i weigh 330 lbs and the wheels have held up great . and this is in a college dorm room where its getting beat up and such.the butt padding gets pretty thin after a year is the only negative i have about this chair . but that will happen with about any chair with that much weight on it . 
james , i bought this chair about ( 2 ) weeks ago and really like it . i just measured it for you and it appears to be 22.5 inches from floor to the top of the seat area . i 'm 6'6 '' , 280 and it fits me very well . i use the chair at a few inches lower than full up so i have room under my desk . good luck . 
pull the up down adjustment handle out , towards the wall , parallel to the floor . 
i do n't know the exact dimensions . but i can tell you the chair is as big as the name implies . so much so that i returned it within a few days of getting it . i am a big guy , not huge , but big , at 6'2 '' , ~195 pounds and it swallowed me . everything about it is built for larger folks than me . it is very sturdy and , yes , space clearance should be considered . sorry i could n't help more . 
yes on the right hand side of the chair there is a little pull handle that unlocks the tilt so it can tilt . 
the seat is at least 4 inches thick . very thick and very comfortable . love it ! also , great lumbar support in the back ! 
yes 
no 
they are not on the smaller sizes . there is one larger model with removable and dishwasher safe grids griddle . for the smaller size i find it easiest to rinse the grills over the sink with the dish sprayer then to wipe it down with paper towel or dry kitchen towel . do not do this with the grill plugged into an electrical outlet . 
the box says china . 
i 've put frozen burgers on it and it worked fine but i have n't tried any other frozen meats in it . 
this is very small . it will be better to get the $ 24 
you can barely fit two burgers , or one piece of chicken breast . thats all it will fit . 
cleaning up after burgers : my method is to take a few folded paper towels and wet them and clean the grill while it 's still warm . all the grease runs into the drip tray while cooking so you just want to get the hard stuff off the grids . after it cools down , i clean it again with wet paper towels and it 's good to go . if you prefer , you can add some dish soap to the paper towels but remember to follow up with wet paper towels or a sponge to get all the soap off . 
no , it does not . it is a small enough grill that you can check on what you are grilling for the stage you want . i have used it for `` chicken '' appetizers , fish - be sure you oil and season the fillet or steak . it also used it to heat frozen waffles and grilled sandwiches . for the short time the grill is working you can stay with it as the grill master .

could be made at any place with george foreman specification and warranty , just like i phone , nike and many other brand and products ... now , components of product are made worldwide , assembly and manufacturing at one place . 
mine did n't ... but it comes clean so easily i really have n't needed one ... 
they are bpa-free , but bpa-free does not mean ea-free ( ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion ) . stressed plastics in particular ( e.g . those used in the microwave , exposed to light ) release hormone-affecting compounds more so , and some bpa-free plastics release more than those with bpa . only way to get around it for now is to use glass . that is until companies start testing their products as ea free y independent labs . 
they are square . probably a couple inches high and wide ... the biggest ones are probably about 5 or 6 inches square , and about 2 inches high ( deep ) . none are terribly big but they are the perfect size for a few cups of something like leftovers or a little more . the small are great for maybe salad dressing or nuts , something like that . i like them a lot : ) 
they are ! i am still amazed by this - even after going through the dishwasher ! i often bring soup or juicy fruit to work and it does not leak . hope that helps ! 
not at all . i 've noticed no residual flavor from the container . these really are the best purchase i 've even made on amazon . i got exactly what i wanted . they 're durable , seal completely and securely , they do n't stain and they do just fine in the dishwasher on a heat setting . you will be happy with your purchase . the different sizes are convenient and theses feel like they 'll last a life time . 
short of a laboratory test , i suppose you just have to take the seller 's word for it . not very different from any container advertised as `` bpa free '' bought at the supermarket -regardless of statements to that effect on the packaging or elsewhere , short of a laboratory test you can not possibly be 100 % sure that indeed the container is bpa free . 
hi angie , as you can see on one of the box 's side , the sizes are the following : 3oz ( .46 cups ) , 6oz ( .84 cups ) , 9oz ( 1.14 cups ) , 15oz ( 1.9 cups ) , 19oz ( 2.4 cups ) , 28oz ( 3.5 cups ) , 37oz ( 4.6 cups ) , and 47oz ( 5.9 cups ) would be the largest . 
i 've never seen the qvc lock and lock but these are thick durable plastic . the locking clips are secure . i 'd drop this full of wine on a white carpet and not bat an eye . great quality product . 
yes , they stack perfectly on the shelf and take up very little space . they actually for inside of one another . 
yes , definitely ! 
the lids are translucent like the bases . made out of the same material . the company name is embossed on them but you can clearly see contents through them . 
as a barber i 've used a hot towel warmer for years . my preferred method is to fold the towel twice over , wet it , roll it , and wring it out , then put in the warmer . without wringing it out it would be too hot and drippy . dry it would n't hold it 's heat once out . plus ... this is n't the sort of towel warmer to use for say ... warming a bath towel . more of a hand , neck , or face towel warmer . hope that was helpful 
yes . we have 2 units that the heating element went out . you might be better to shop around some more . 
mine did the exact same thing and was bought at the same time . i took it to a local hardware store and they fixed it ( not sure what they did to fix it ) then it stopped working again after 2 weeks . i ended up just trashing it and plan to get a new one from a different company . it cost me $ 25 to get it fixed and it did n't make sense to pay another 25 for it to not work again : ( 
2 prong plug 
no , it could be harmful to leave on . 
it does n't seem very sturdy to sit in , but it is great as a shelf shoe rack . i love mine . 
hello celeste ! the space between the shelves in middle measure about 9.5 '' in height . please feel free to reach out to our customer service department if you have any further questions , monday-friday 8am-4:30pm ( cst ) at ( 888 ) 944-8667 or email us at help @ whitmor.com . have a great day ! 
mine measures 13 '' . we are so happy with this bench . 
all wood . 
i think it is very close to the quoted dimensions of 11.5 x 41.8 x 19.3 . 
seems like it . 
it could be used for dvds and scrapbooks . i think it seems sturdy -- i can sit on it with no problem ( i weigh 124 lbs ) . 
painting is possible . it has a shine to it so may need sanding . staining would seem tough with the finish . i thought about the same thing but it does look nice as is . 
10 '' 
actually yes , and it is so full of buckwheat that you can take a bunch out to fill a sports sock to heat that up and place around your neck . you wo n't even miss it from the pillow . you can also do a sports sock this way if you fill it with rice while you wait for the pillow to arrive . hope this helps you . 
the original case is zippered so you can add or remove buckwheat to customize firmness . i bought the additional pillow case which had envelop closure on one end . the decorative case that comes with the pillow is open ended both ends and fabric is rough . would definitely recommend buying the extra pillow case . love the pillow , great for side sleepers . hope this helps . 
hi kenneth , yes , the shipping charge is based on each item ordered . thanks . 
hi , please place the order and email us your preference . thanks 
i dont think so . the buckwheat hulls really wouldnt retain heat ... would they ? not certain ... but i wouldnt try it . & gt ; _ & lt ; 
yes . i was told that bed bugs live in the box spring and just move around the mattress . i have the cover for both mattress and box spring 
yes ! we have a pillow top , and it fits perfectly . 
yes 
hello . i wash it in warm water and dry it at a low temperature setting , or air dry . 
it feels like fabric.i have mattress & pillow covers.they are waterproof.highly recommend this brand.also check amazon closely because the have different prices on the same items & also double packs of pillow cover at great deals .hope this helps . 
it says 100 % polyester knit . 
the fabric is n't very see through . it is a stretchy polyester fabric that mostly covers the pattern on our mattress . 
sort of a plastic material 
any depth 
yes it fits . its actually even a bit bigger than i thought so it was fairly easy to put on . 
it is 1 comforter and 2 pillows . ( pillow , set of 2 ) . i like it very much , i think it is good quality for this price . 
whatever plastic feathers are in there go through the sheets and stabs my body same with the pillows 
it is goose down . i bought 2 of them and my daughter and i both agree incredibly warm . the only thing that was odd was the bottom part of the blanket you could see the feathers between in the blanket so waiting to see how durable it is . but for right now i would definitely buy a third if my son was living at home instead of at school . 
we do n't use it that much , but so far it seems to be working fine . 
there is a push in switch at the bottom of the right vertical rail . it 's also where the wiring comes out . no this can not be use as an alternate heater because the rails only get warm to the touch . it does a good job drying towels , takes awhile , but it is low electrical consumption . 
thank you for your inquiry . this is plug in option . however , you can purchase hardwired connection as well , it is sold separately . kind regards ! 
artur , the new 2014 models have a hardwiring kit already inside of the package . however , if you have an older version that requires a hardwiring it , i 'd recommend you to contact the manufacturer directly : virtu usa . they 'll be able to assist you . bath center 
mine are put away at this time . they are definatley large enough for a can or bottle with a koozie 
we can try to accommodate . but we can not always guarantee it . 
colors are chosen at random based on availability at time of purchase . inventory numbers change constantly . 
it 's about 12 inches long and 5 inches wide . holds a fair number of bags but i ca n't say for sure how many ... just those plastic bags you get from the grocery store . i find it very useful and keeps my bag clutter managed . 
11 '' tall , 6 '' wide , 3 '' deep 
either but i 'm sure it 's designed to be the bottom . i could n't get it to stick to my cabinet door . 
yes from the bottom

yes they are , we have washed ours in the dishwasher many times and they still look new . we love these measuring spoons . 
china 
you could use the spoons without taking them off the ring , but it is much easier if you use them individually . 
with the ring folded down bank on 5 and a 1 2 inches long and 2 and a 1 2 inches wide . with the rig flipped up think 7 inches long and 2 and a 1 2 inches wide . ps , i love these measuring spoons : ) 
i bought them as a gift . i have not heard back there was anything wrong with them . there was a note enclosed with them on how to care for them . they have not rusted . plus , the company was very sincere in wanting to make sure i was happy . if you bought something and was not pleased , i believe they would make it right for you . sorry to not have more specifics for you . 
im not an expert on the gauge of steel , but these are made well and durable 
ha ha ! the large ring they are on would fit through an earring hole that is larger than a simple piercing , say something like a small guage . the weight might be off-putting after a while , but i would imagine they could be worn for an hour or so comfortably . 
from largest to smallest , the sizes are 1 tbsp ( 15 ml ) , 1 2 tbsp ( 7.5 ml ) , 1 tsp ( 5 ml ) , 1 2 tsp ( 2.5 ml ) , and 1 4 tsp ( 1.25 ml ) . 
the ring is 2 inches in diameter 
the muffin pan is a standard size , 12.8 x 9.7 x 1.2 inches . each cup holds 2.5 oz and measures 2 3 4 inches across . 
abraham , each cup holds about 2.5 oz or 75 ml and is the same size as most standard metal muffin pans . 
no . i just put the mixture in and placed it in the oven . worked perfectly ! 
thanks for your question . the bottom diameter of each cup is about 2 inches or 5 cm . 
the following email was sent to georgine to help answer her question . -- - thank you for getting in touch . i understand that you are baking corn muffins with two ovenart silicone muffin pans at the same time . you are also rotating the dark colored and light aluminum cookie sheets between oven racks halfway through baking for even cooking . i 'd be happy to figure this out together with you to see if we can avoid burnt bottoms and raw middles ! as you may know , there are many factors that determine how baked goods turn out , including oven type , oven brand , temperature accuracy , heat distribution , to even odd things like altitude above below sea level ! we have found that the most effective way of getting to know your ovenart pan is by continuing to bake with it . here i include some general tips to bear in mind , then some specific suggestions for you to try . - baking on the middle rack is recommended as food located closest to heating elements ( top or bottom ) will brown faster than on the middle rack . - dark metal pans typically absorb more heat than light metal colored pans , so these items may brown faster on the bottom than on light metal pans . - rotating pans mid-way can help ensure even browning , however , keep in mind that the heat lost from opening the oven door will have to be compensated for . - to prevent over-browning or burning , silicone muffin pans should be removed from the cookie sheet immediately after taking out of the oven . - bear in mind that silicone quickly cools to the touch once removed from the oven so baked goods will not continue to cook brown the same way they would if baked in a metal or glass pan . georgine , i assume that the cookie sheets can not both fit on the middle rack . if they do , please try baking only on the middle rack , checking doneness at 14 mins , and every 3-5 mins after that . if they do not both fit on a rack , then start with the dark sheet on the middle rack and the aluminum sheet on the rack above . check doneness on both pans at 14 mins . if the dark sheet muffins are done , remove from oven and move the aluminum sheet to the middle rack . remember to remove the muffin pan from the cookie sheet once it is out of the oven to prevent further browning . if the dark sheet muffins are not done at 14 mins , rotate the sheets , and check again in 2-3 mins . the aluminum sheet should be on the middle rack for the remainder of the baking time until they are done . check for doneness every 3-5 mins . georgine , how many different rack heights does your oven have ? is it a newer or older oven ? what makes our situation here a bit challenging is the use of different colored cookie sheets . we might take a couple of tries to get this right , but we 'll get there ! let me know how this approach works for your next batch and we 'll make any necessary changes as we go . thank you once again for reaching out . 
the recommended maximum oven temperature is 480f ( 250c ) . 
i 've done this several times before where i did not use all the open slots and nothing has happened to the pan or even the muffins . just keep in mind the muffins will probably cook faster by a few minutes 
thanks for your question dot ! ovenart bakeware silicone products are molded in china under strict quality guidelines . however , please bear in mind that the quality and performance of silicone bakeware is largely determined by the raw materials , the silicone itself . as such , ovenart silicone is sourced from a german company whose product is widely considered to be the highest quality grade silicone available for food products . because of our quality requirements , all ovenart products meet and exceed international food product health standards including u.s. fda , health canada , swiss sgs , and german lfgb . quality matters to us , in everything that we do . have a great day ! 
have n't tried it , but the manufacturer claims it 's microwave safe . i believe most food-grade silicone products are microwave safe . 
i use mine three or four times per week . i was initially having the same issue but now i too spray the pan , what i have found to be the trick is to wait only three or four minutes before i remove from the pan and i push them out from the bottom . 
yes , but there are some things to keep in mind . this mat is made if flexible silicone so there will be some slight sagging between the bars of your oven rack . something relatively stable like a pizza would be unaffected , but more delicate items like macarons would be very affected . also keep in mind that with a flexible sheet it might difficult to remove many items ( like 24 cookies ) before they have cooled for a bit . 
i do n't know , but i suspect it 's not made in the us . 
hard to estimate , but i would say similar to thickness of like card stock . thinner than card board . hope that helps ! 
the sheet set i received did n't say . it is n't 100 % cotton . it just says 100 % cotton touch . it 's 100 % microfiber though 
the comforter or sheets ? 
yes , amazon does have one that match , just not easily found . 
hi , thanks for your question . this set includes : 1 x comforter 90x90 '' , 2 x pillow shams 20x26+2 '' , 1 x bed skirt 60x80+14 '' , 2 x decor pillows 18x18 '' , 1 x breakfast 9x14 '' , 1 x decor pillow 20x20 '' , 1 x flat sheet , 1 x fitted sheet , and 2 x pillow cases . for future reference , this information is located in the product description of the product page . i hope this helps ! 
yes it is.. and very comfortable i sleep like a baby , and not very expensive ... 
no . this bed is terrible . i weigh under 130 lbs and it sinks in permanently quickly . i have had the bed for 7 or 8 months and had to flip it 3 times already and i need to do it again . i just spun it around the last time and you can see the big dip in it and it looks broken down and uneven . i would suggest a different bed . 
hi . the $ 150 is an extra charge for the delivery . 
this mattress are very good 
the bottom part of the infuser is 1.75 '' , but the top is 2.375 '' with a .25 '' metal rim . it is also 3 '' deep . i have my doubts about your teapot , but it will fit nicely in the average cup . 
i find it very simple . just bang the infuser against the garbage can and shake . lot less messy for me than the tea ball was.. 
a definite no . this infuser was designed for use with a standard size , single-serving tea cup , coffee cup , or mug . it was not intended to brew a tea pot full of tea in one go . 
to answer your question , yes , this is made in china . it is stated on the box in which it is packed . 
i do n't know what yerba mate is but i can tell you that the mesh of this item is very fine , much finer than other tea strainers that i have used in the past . this one can be used with rooibos tea which is very fine and tends to get into your cup with other strainers . 
it works in my 2 '' thermos - it does only take the bottom half as infuser widens at the top 
hi . this tea infuser was designed to hold only a little tea . it 's great for making several cups , but it is not big enough to make a gallon . you would have to use it several times in order to get your gallon . 
i do n't think so . it 's a very fine mesh . even when i get to the end of my bag of loose tea and its all fine it does n't get thru into my tea . : ) 
hi faith , i am not sure what you mean by your question as i have never made any oil infusions . the mesh is really fine and will prevent almost any sized particle through to the cup except for very fine powders and grains . i looked at some strainers for oil infusers and i think that this should work for you . i am guessing that you will strain your oil infusion through the strainer ? it should be very good for that , but i guess that it might depend on how thick the oil is . wish i could give you a more definitive answer . i hope that this helps . regards , coolahoo 
no , it does not get hot . 
hello ! this product is similar to other brand name fermentation jars . the primal pickler uses platinum silicone which is the most inert product available for this application . 
the weights are sold separately : http : www.amazon.com crock-rocks-pack-large-pickler dp b00d0inu8i ref= 
yes , absolutely ! i believe that is what it gets used for the majority of the time ! 
if you are asking how wide the grommet hole is the answer is 3 8 '' . the hole that the grommet is inserted into is 5 8 '' . 
yes it does . it also comes with a little rubber cork to put in when you are done fermenting and want to store in the fridge . 
we sell the glass weights separately , unfortunately we are currently out of stock . we update our facebook page when they are back in stock . thanks ! 
yes , it comes with the hole . it has a little rubber gasket already installed so that the airlock fits in very securely . 
my lids have handles but they do n't sit well . the unit is not very logical either if your lid does n't fit exactly it will fall through and to put lids back in you have to take them all out and put them back in size order which it a pain . kind of like a soda holder , when you take one out all the rest push forward . 
i think so . each ring comes out about an inch or so . 
i just measured mine and it was 17 '' x 11 '' but yes that should be right . 
i do n't know if hanging on a bakers rack would work . i have mine on a wall . the lids plus the holder itself would get heavy on the bakers rack . i have 1 glass lid and the rest of the lids are stainless steel . i had a bakers rack years ago and i can only think back on the type i had . i do n't think it would work . the sides of the bakers rack were pretty open so i do n't know where you would hang the pot lid . sorry if this does n't help you . 
can you maybe get some of the command hooks ? 
yes they will fit suggest to put the largest on top to smallest . make sure you give plenty of space for the larger lid . our calphalon and cuisinart fit well 
yes . i ordered two of these and i really , really like them ! i have them hanging on the wall in my pantry - easy access - easy to put stuff away . 
no but it works great . 
my lids with flat handles did n't fit.i am currently using a lid holder on the countertop for the lids with the flat handles . i was only able to use my rounded handles . 
i start from the top and move it a little to the side 
it 's 10 inches long , about 8.25 deep and about 4.5 tall . the divided sections are each about 2.75 inches . 
yes , i believe it would . if it can handle large cookie sheets and muffin tins it should also hold platters ... ..of course , depending on their size . i found it important that the organizer not be a lot narrower than the width of the cabinet ... ..the sides of the cabinet help to hold everything in place . 
yes it is . the slots are wide enough . 
it is just under 8.5 '' wide and barely over 10 '' long . by `` long '' i mean the length of the four dividers that would go front to back in your cabinet . 
from the feet to bottom of rack is just a tad over 1 2 inch from surface . 
wide 9 '' , deep 9 '' , height 5 '' , between rows 3 '' . 
actually not bad , if you have any problem use the little felt pads on the feet 
unless fastened to a side wall , if stood so opening for storage is horizontal , it would tip over . 
no 
this will not work with plates 
overall dimensions : h 7 1 2 `` . w 7 1 2 `` , l 11 '' . shelf height . 2 1 2 `` for bottom 2 shelfs , top has no top . 
the feet ( base ) are pretty small . i have mine on a wire shelf , but there 's an acetate liner that 's acting as a base . there 's a 7 inch span between the center of the feet on the short side , if that helps . my shelves have the right spacing for the shelf to sit securely even if i did n't have the acetate . if the feet do n't line up with your shelf , you could use something underneath it as a base . 
mine was different than what is pictured . i received an under the shelf organizer . 
here is what i found with mine . to remove the ice , you first remove the top piece ( the part with the hole ) . then , gently squeeze or push up from the bottom piece until the ice loosens . you can also try pulling the mold away from the ice . important : when removing the ice , be careful when putting it into a glass container so that the glass does not crack ! it is safest to remove the ice into your hand or a plastic cup first , and then gently transfer it to your glass . hope that helps ! 
i have not done this yet , but plan on it . apparently having clear water , boiling it , etc . does not matter that much in the big picture . controlling the freezing from the top down ... where water essentially pushes the `` not-clear-parts '' downward ... is the most crucial part . so if you fill a pot of water , submerge this style of mold then turn it upside down , and pull it out of the water with the opening still in contact with the bigger body of water , and finally use a wire to keep it in that position while freezing ... you should get a clear sphere . if you need a visual of this , search `` alcademics '' where i saw this and you can get a step by step . 
2-they are large-the size of a tangerine . 
a : ok , this question sounds a bit obvious , but i have found there is a `` best way '' . - attach the two pieces of each ice maker together first , before adding water - use the best quality water available ( filtered , boiled , reverse osmosis etc . ) - carefully pour water into the top hole ( use a cup ) and leave an empty space of about 1 centimeter all around the hole . the empty space needed because ice expands . - chill the ice makers in your freezer for several hours . if you want them solid all the way through , allow about 3 to 4 hours . you could also chill for less time if you want to leave a liquid center . i found that boiling the water beforehand and then adding to the ice ball mold makes clearer ice , but that may just be me . try it out . just make sure to use good quality water rather than tap water . 
two separate molds to an order . i doubled up and bought 2 orders , for a net of 4 molds 
made in the usa 
i filled each ball with 3 0z . of water . 
2 ! it 's worth it ! ! ! 
perhaps you fill them too full ? above the fill line ? mine work great . 
no 
the measurements given refer to the outside dimensions - max height , width and depth . that is the space you would need for it to fit - it is not the size of the drawers . i bought the medium and large - i have screwed the medium into the shelf space and it is hard for me to properly measure it but the large i removed from the space and it measures exactly the dimensions written in the product description 10.6 x 16 x 7.8. the drawer that slides inside is 8.25 x 15.25 x 6 all measured in inches . 
i did - works great . the top metal mesh plate of the large has a little lip around it that keeps the 'feet ' of the unit above it in line . there are also two screws at the two rear 'posts ' that you can screw down into that mesh plate so it does n't tip forward when extending the drawer . 
yes . in my review i said that i removed the dividers & did n't use them so i could fit more cleaning supplies in . also , i did n't use the screws to attach it to the bottom of my kitchen cabinet . i just placed it inside & it works fine . 
yes - there are two products : a `` large '' basket that i used on the bottom which has a closed top that allows for stacking . then i bought the `` medium '' basket to put on top of the large . i got a great result used this way-it is very stable and is sliding well ( used it for about 1 month now ) . 
it seems to be a standard rolling wheel inside a metal track . very smooth pullout . when the drawer is fully open , it stops and can not be removed unless you tip up the front of the drawer and lift it out of the track . 
yes , the dividers are removable , so you can store long items . i use mine to store a tall blender container and it fits nicely . 
yes there are tabs on the back end of each unit to secure it to a cabinet bottom and the screws are included . 
first - single basket - i ordered a few then you can stack them like the third picture . i love them ! 
10.6 inch is the shelf , the basket is 8 inch . 
yes it can be removed , sort of like the veggie bin in your fridge . had to take it out in order to secure it to the base cabinet . 
items could be up to 6 inches tall . the drawer itself is 5.75 '' tall , from the bottom of the drawer to the bottom of the top shelf is 6.125 '' . the wasted space below the drawer is about 1 inch high . hope this helps ! 
7 3 4 high , 16 '' depth 10 1 2 wide 
hi scribbler - yes you can . you might notice that the top frame is mesh that extends just past the four legs of the frame so the legs will very nicely fit within the lip of the top frame . additionally , the back to legs have tabs with a pre-drilled hole . the two included self-tapping screws will allow you to fasten the bottom frame to your cabinet - and the top frame to the mesh of the basket frame it will sit on . you can continue to stack these 3 or four high . do keep in mind that what you put in the basket can not be too tall - otherwise it will hit the top frame . the roller glides are really nice . i 'm very happy with our two-pair ( large and small ) we bought . hope this helps . 
whole metal , thank you 
8 inch wide for the basket 
i took the dvd with the longest case in my collection ( the international ) and placed it in the basket . it fits fine with about a half inch to spare . just enough room to stick your finger in the pull the dvd out . you 'll have to lay the dvds on their sides ; they are too tall to stand up in the basket . btw- the basket is very well made , a good grade of metal . 
hi - good question . you will have just under 6 inches of clearance - i would say if you have something less than 5 3 4 inches high it will fit . also the basket will give you 15 3 4 depth ( front to back ) at 7 7 8 width ( side to side ) . hope this helps . we are using the bottom rack to hold various boxes of wax paper , aluminum foil . we also bought the top shelf to hold tall bottles of cleaning products . if you are putting this under a kitchen sink make sure you will clear the drain pipe , and cold and hot water cut off faucets . hope this helps . 
it 's probably not the most ideal location for use , but i do n't see any reason why it would n't work . i ca n't see how the cold or moisture would affect the structure or functionality of this drawer . in fact , now that you 've presented the idea , i must admit i 'm currently standing in front of my fridge considering the possibilities . hmmmm . . . 
cassie , for the inside measurement of the drawer , its width is 8 inches . a full sized or dinner sized paper plate wont fit as they are 9 to 10 inches across . dessert plates are 7 to 8 inches . hope this helps . 
i am about ready to try that myself - it seems like it would work . it is just that with medium on large , there is a bit more stability . 
i measured mine and the width is 17.5 '' on the dot . 
i keep all my manuals . the info on manual says call : 800-290-0465 email : service @ southshore.ca or visit www.southshore.ca you can live chat with them . you can use my product code , in case you dont have one . its 500052959 i have had mine several months and i wont be needing it for anything . the product is very nice and ive had no problems . 
it is very close to espresso . you do n't need to go with black . these are really nice . 
unfinished . 
yes . i am 5'6 '' and when i stand next to it the top of the shelf is parallel to my lower neck , where the clavicle bones meet . great shelf , i love mine . perfect for my college books and jewelry etc . 
sorry my son in law put mine together 
16 and 1 8 inch inside dimension , width . 11.5 inch deep . ( heights are adjustable ) 
box weight says 63 and product weight is 52. just correcting my answer . : ) 
contact the seller . i believe it is by design . in my case it was loud enough to disturb my sleep . 
the owners guide says ; `` window kit installation when the unit is operating as an air conditioner or dehumidifier , the unit draws in fresh outdoor air and exhausts hot air out of the room to complete the air exchange . when the unit is operating in fan mode no outdoor air exchange takes place . the window kit and exhaust hose do not need to be installed when the unit is used as a fan . note : the supplied window kit can be installed in sliding windows and sliding glass doors up to 7 ft. long ( approximate length ) '' 
it 's 110 . 
the diameter is about 5 to 5.5 inches . you can always call the company to see about a smaller tube , and you can try to get an adaptor and a smaller tube at your local hardware store . note , though , that the tube fits into a bracket which you mount in your window ( or other exhaust area ) . you 'll also be forcing hot air to exhaust more quickly through the smaller tube . it 's best to ask the company if that 's a good idea . 
if it 's one in proper working order then it 's quiet enough . when you first start it it may produce a `` sound '' but i would n't call it a deafening sound , it 's just a bit louder than the unit normally is . after a few minutes it goes away and the a c is pretty quiet . if it were loud i would have returned my unit . 
hi diana , yes , the unit has to be vented outside the area you are trying to cool off . it comes with the materials to vent the unit outside a window . if the office you have has a dropped ceiling you maybe able to vent into the space above your office space . i did that , vented exhaust into roof space . 
the unit by design , evaporates the condensation it removes from the space being cooled . it does this in the same way a window ac does . 
it is not too loud ; about the same as a window fan . i have mine in the bedroom , and i would not be able to sleep if it was very noisy . 
i found the manual at this link which probably answers everybody 's questions about the product . http : cache.air-n-water.com manuals avalon-bay-ab8k.pdf 
hello , if you want to customize the pillowcase , you can send the picture you like to me in the email , then we will customized for you . thank you . 
dear friend . this pillowcase size is 20 '' x30 '' 
hello , all our pilow case are made of 50 % cotton , 50 % polyester . thank you . 
mine have `` flakes '' that appear on the surface of my drink if i do n't wash the ice ball off before using it . i have run the molds through the dishwasher several times , washed in hot water by hand , used vinegar to wash , towel dried them and let them air dry , used tap water , filtered water and bottled water . nothing works . the ice from my freezer does not have this issue , so it must be the ice balls . i wish i had gone with a different brand . 
no 
no stoppers included but i have n't had any fall over as they have a flat bottom surface . they work really well . 
i never actually measured the amount i put in . i fill them up and pour some out . sometimes the balls crack , but i 've never had one crack apart . i use filtered water . maybe that might make a difference . 
hi mitch , all our products are manufactured in china . thanks rizzi meia palma fresher products ltd 
i have never made a bath bomb so i 'm not sure . it 's a total of 8 pieces that make 4 spheres . 
mine were slightly flattened on one half but i guess i just need to fill them up a little bit more ... did n't want to overfill because of expanding while freezing . still happy with the result ! 
you seem to be correct . the interior diameter measures exactly 2 3 8 inches . 
i have not had a problem with any odor from the arctic chill ice ball maker , but i found this suggestion : http : www.ehow.com how_8108725_rid-silicone-plastic-odor.html 
try peeling the edge back with the tips of your fingernails , kind of like peeling an orange , but do n't put your nails next the ice . 
yes , it does . however , it is thin tin and a bit difficult to remove . i only remove it while i hold the unit over the sink . 
the bta720xl bit more toaster is 7.75 inches tall . 
120v 
the bta720xl bit more toaster has two standard size slots on it and is not designed for the longer artisan breads . however , breville does have a smiliar model that is designed for the longer artisan breads : http : www.amazon.com breville-bta730xl-more-4-slice-toaster dp b00comhbt0 ref=sr_1_1 ? s=home-garden & ie=utf8 & qid=1424454720 & sr=1-1 & keywords=bta730xl 
it is warm to the touch , and can be handled by the sides of the toaster with no problems - however , i would not classify it as `` cool to the touch '' after using . 
always perfect . buy it , you wo n't have any regrets . jim 
i imagine 5x5x1 '' , but i have n't tried that size . i use franz bread in it which measures 5wx4hx1 2 '' thick and it does fine . 
not home now , but i 'd guess 15 to 24 inches . definitely 'counter top ' length and no more . 
it 's made in china of course . j . 
looks and feels like stainless steel 
yes they are oven safe but , do not put the lid in the oven . 
4 containers and 4 lids 
no - they have plastic rims and clasps , so the lids can not go in the oven ! the bottoms can though 
yes , you can put them in the freezer and you can also use them to bake or heat food ( of course without lids ) . i do n't know the exact measurements but the larger one is about 6 '' lx3 '' wx2 '' d ... the larger round one is about 4 '' diameter x 2 '' deep . 
clear ( translucent ) with a light blue rim 
i never use the lid as a cover in the microwave , even loosened . i think it would damage the rubber seals . 
according to the amazon webpage they are . i have n't washed them in my dishwasher . 
both of the larger ones are rectangular . the largest one is about 7 inches by 5 1 4 inches by 2 3 4 inches . 
i have no idea . they say made in korea . microwave safe , oven safe , not stove top safe . i like them , they work for me . 
& lt ; & lt ; rectangular & gt ; & gt ; 1-3.5 cups 828 ml , 1-1.6 cups 378 ml & lt ; & lt ; round & gt ; & gt ; 1-1.6 cups 378 ml , 1-0.73 cups 173 ml 
they only come in one size . i would call it a comfortable medium large . 
there is only one glove per package . the glove can be used on either hand . 
i use it to bbq to handle the grill and it work good 
just one and it 's kinda bulky , not like a regular glove , but works great ! 
one and they great gloves 
hi noel . the nutone is pretty much universal . we noticed that it was a tight fight , when we tried connecting it to the wall connector . we had to file down the hose connectors to fit inside the hose adapter . once this was done , it worked great . christine 
no 
no it does not : ) it does not need one . this is a low voltage hose meaning the power nozzle on it is air driven and not electrical . because of that it does not need to have a pigtail or direct connect connection because the power nozzle does not use electricity . the hose is electric in low voltage which allows you to turn on and off the central vacuum unit with a flip of your finger but that is it . because of this you just plug the hose into any central vacuum outlet and it works . no pigtail or direct connect needed . if you are looking for the electrical version of this kit that uses the pigtail connection we also sell that one in our store . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs 
this kit is terrible 
i do not believe so . however , if you measure the the male part of the older brand and cross references the new one , you should get the exact details needed to make a choice . 
yes , but it dosent work very well . it dosent pick up anything bigger then a dime . and if you have carpet that has any length at all it dosent even do that . 
when i bought this i thought i could use it with my existing system but i could n't . you basically plug it into your wall and use what you have . i do n't like this system at all so i do n't even use mine . i went and bought an actual vaccuum instead : ( 
no 
i 'm not sure . item specifications indicated that it 's a 'universal ' system . we have a beam central vac and it works perfectly . 
i am not aware of any warranty . we 've had the set 6 months , all parts working fine . 
there is a primer from the manufacturer gmmdl regarding the properties of the coating . its non ptfe , non poa . http : www.gmmdl.com products duraceram-for-electrics # .uqcnpvtu18f . this link may not work , but if you google gmmdl and duraceram which is their trademark on the coating , you can get to pages that give full technical specs . my waffle maker is still working great , not seeing any degradation in the nonstick . i think the safety of this is pretty good , it is a ceramic coating which usually do not release organics . the plasticy early waffles some of the other reviewers mention is from initial manufacturing , not indicative on ongoing use . disclaimer- i do have a background from university studies in late 1970 's which included ceramic coatings and glazes of that era . food safety of coatings at that time was most concerned with lead release , not organics . but the processes used for coating burn or bake off most organic chemicals possibly used as binders or to suspend particles in solution , etc . lots of times there is also some surface residue from cleaning or rinsing , or mold release compounds in manufacturing process . i think this is the source of the odor taste on the first waffle or two through the griddle . so wash it good with soap and a brush first . safest - cast iron . ceramics and glass- pretty safe . organic coatings- i 'd rather not . imo . 
belgin , it makes a very deep waffle . i had the regular oster maker i got yrs ago and you really ca n't even compare the two . 
i agree with bonnie in that it does n't need any coating . i use krusteaz waffle mix which uses a little vegetable oil in the batter . 
we used our waffle maker for seven months , about 1-2 times per week . i am disappointed with the short life , but the unit worked great for the time used . 
do n't buy it , it does n't last . 
the diameter is approximately 8 inches . 
yes 
it 's a 1000w appliance w a continuous adjustment dial , but i cook mostly at less than halfway to maximum . you should size your breaker or inverter to the maximum wattage . 
unfortunately , no it does not . 
after it cools down , i take it to the sink , tip on it 's side and wet it down with a baby bottle brush . then wipe the inside out with a dry towel . i also spray it before use with my own olive oil spray . 
yes ! ! ! ! it is very powerful in the high years and very gentle in the low gears . it 's perfect . 
on the lowest speed it starts out slowly and i have found this very helpful to minimize splattering . i really like this mixer and i use it a lot ! this is the first hand mixer i have owned that i can control splattering . 
yes , it works very well with both . 
the same switch-button that is used to select the speed is also the eject button when it is pushed . this could be an issue for some people since one might push down on the button in the process of selecting a speed . i have n't had any problem with it , however ... 
the button to eject the beaters is very stiff at first , but will get easier to push with time . 
a little over 2 feet . 
8 1 2 by 3 1 2 by 5 1 2. it 's a fairly large hand mixer . seems to be heavy duty . i like mine . a little heavy but i 'm getting use to it . 
i do n't own the box anymore , but the dimensions of the actual mixer ( standing tall ) is 8 1 2 '' high x 6 1 2 '' deep , which includes the on off switch jutting out a bit . 
i have n't used it for dough yet , however i think it is powerful enough for that purpose . i do not have dough hooks with mine .

cooking surface 11 '' x 15 '' overall size 14 '' x 21-1 4 '' 
yep ! 
healthy , yes , the grease or juices of what you are cooking drain into a drain pan in the middle of the unit . altogether the unit is 4 pieces . it is very easy to clean . i love it ! 
yes it is reversible one grill side and one griddle 
it does not have a warming tray , it has a drip pan to catch drips . 
we suggest that you refer to the cooking temperature guidelines in any recipes that you may be using . if you would like a copy the user manual , please feel free to contact us through our www.oster.com contactus website . 
no it does not , but do n't let that deter you from this purchase ... the health benifits far out weigh the non ceramic grill and griddles out there ! ! ! 
no 
yes 
a little on the slow side , but be patient and gentle and treat it nice and it does a good job . not recommended that you use it on real high heat if you want it to last . 
as listed in the product description , each cup is approximately 2-5 8 '' diameter at the top , 1-3 4 '' diameter at the bottom , and 1-1 4 '' tall ; each cup holds about 2-1 4 fluid ounces to the rim . 
i 've used them in the microwave , you should n't have anyproblems at all . the 1 2 3 recipe will work great . 
i am not sure but when i first took them out of the container i thought they were small but they are the same size as a regular size cupcake ( like the paper liners ) they are nice and colorful and do hold up well . 
sorry for the delay.. but , yes i did get the assorted colors and they are perfect ... love them ... used them as little bowls for individual ice cream ! ! 
made in china , but looks come from a company in utah . i could n't recommend these highly enough - we just love them because they sturdy . 
mine worked beautifully . probably depends somewhat on how much batter is in the cup . i am very satisfied with the baking results i have had 
this is briefly mentioned in the description . each cup holds about 2-1 4 ounces to the rim . 
hello ! i do n't see why not , but the question is why ? the point of these is so that it is easy to pop the muffins out instead of peeling the paper . 
yep ! they are the same size as a paper cupcake liner . i love mine ! 
no , the package states made in china 
exactly what is in the picture is what i received . 
my experience is that they 're all the same 
sorry ! do not ship outside us , thanks 
comes with ac dc converter that plugs into standard wall outlet . 
5.5 '' deep x 6.25 '' wide x 11 '' high 
do n't know . bought it for my mother who is in a nursing home . it has been running 24 7 since christmas . no problems so far . 
you are kidding right ? 
they are made in the usa 
yes . 
no , i coudnt , sorry 
we have ours under a shelf , and it works fine . i think it reacts to movement , rather than something in proximity . we like ours very much . 
10 '' wide-7.7 '' deep-14.5 '' high you can find conversion charts at conversionchart.org and click on length . 
yes you can . it 's the best popcorn maker we have ever had . 
we like it . it is however our second one - the handle came off and the glass then fell and broke on the previous one . we decided to try again because of the different handle on the new one . we really like the popcorn it makes . 
the first one i owned of these the handle fell off . it was a glasss handle . i was foolish enough to buy another one 10 years later hoping the handle problem had been addressed . so i thought since they changed to a silicone handle maybe they had fixed the problem . i see they have not . my main problem with this popper this time is that i did n't like the way the popcorn tasted after popping it . i only used it twice and gave it to goodwill . i did not use it enough to wait for the handle to fall off . even if you found another handle i do n't know how you would attach it . whatever way the manufacturer is attaching is not working so i do n't think anyone else could do it either . 
yes 
bennington , vt 
seven and a half inches high and ten inches across the jug + handle 
no , it 's glass and silicone . designed for microwave use . 
17 and a 1 4 '' 
yasmine i do n't know that was a couple of months ago i purchased the chairs ... sorry . 
it is 18 '' from the center of the front of the seat to the curved back . it is 12.5 '' from the corner of the front of the seat to the front edge of the curved back . hope that helps 
i do n't think so . but it 's grey so i think it will be hard to see stains . i hope this helps . 
the chair is sturdy . it does n't wobble at all . 
i do not know 
can handle over 260 pounds . 
roughly 23.5 '' w x 14.5 '' d x 25.5 '' h 
this is a really good question , danielle . i had not needed to do any cleaning of my hamper so i went to look at it and investigate a little for you . there is a liner around the entire interior which is different from the outer material and feels like it will keep moisture from wicking through to the outside fabric . i held a cloth saturated with water against the inside material and got no soaking through to the outside at all . i also held the wet cloth against the outside material and got no soaking through to the inside either . in fact , neither the inside nor the outside showed any evidence of having been wetted . so , i think this hamper will be easy to spot clean ( both inside and out ) and to spritz with a cleaning solution and wipe clean . anything more thorough than that i do n't know . i ca n't say positively that the product is `` water proof '' but it definitely resists a thorough wetting . it does fold flat when you remove the top . hope this helps . 
not sure if it 's specifically treated to be mildew resistant , but it 's been fine for us in a bathroom for the last 4 months . 
no , i would n't advise that you do this with this hamper . 
i ca n't answer in loads but it will hold a weeks worth of mine and my wife 's clothes . 
do n't have a cat.. 
the bed is n't squeaky at all . its quite comfortable . 
yes it has the same dimensions for a queen size bed . and you do n't need a bed frame for this type of bed ! 
no u will have to use the foot board in order to keep the bed together . and yes the directions say one person but my child has had a friend over and both teens slept on the bed 1 night only . 
just ordered it last night , if i 'm correct it shouldnt be more than a 6 foot flat box . 
400 to 500 pounds . 
i have just a mattress on the frame , with no box spring . the bed does n't really need a box spring , but i was still fearful of sagging . so , i ordered two bed boards the place in between the mattress and frame and have had no problems . 
it reminds me more of bronze than black brown ... i think it would look fine with a black dresser or accent table . 
yes 
id say its about a foot off ground 
both headboard and footboard are 4 ' 11.5 '' 
length fully flat extended is 70inches length with chair back up is roughly 60 '' seat height is 15 '' chair back height is 32 '' width is 30 '' 
those are just velcro straps . you can cut them or , like me , just stick them to the bottom of the seat . i must say that this furniture is n't as sturdy as it looks . hope this answers your question . 
the smell was what you would expect from a new packaged item and yes it went away within a week . 
off white 
do n't know what the manufacturer 's weight limit is , but i can tell you that my grandchildren ( 2 of them ) sit on this simultaneously and their total weight is around 300 lbs . they move this chaise around the room and sit on it together for hours at a time . hope this helps . 
yes it sturdy to lean on . i have lounged on it for hours watching tv ! 
i 've used but two settings but i believe that there is a 45 degree . not sure . 
greetings , our supplier has stated that all you have to do is attach the legs . hope this was helpful ! thanks 
my daughter called me saying that it had no legs ... however it ended up being in a compartment under the couch ... it closes flush with velcro . i hope your is there too ... it is a pretty good chaise lounge chair . good luck . 
it 's more black . it has a texture to it so not just one color . 
sorry david , i do n't the exact weight capacity . how ever , with have had no problem with it so far . all i can say is that it can hold at least 200 pounds with out a problem . hope this helps , best of luck , cameron . 
i think it 's pretty sturdy . not the light , flimsy type of metal . it 's a good quality , particularly considering the price . 
about 9 '' . 
yes , i believe so 
yes , we did . 
i sleep comfortably with two adults . i 'm 150. he 's 180 
600 lbs 272 kgs 
same thing happened to me ! : ( did you happen to find an instruction manual ? 
no 
yes it comes with both 
thanks for your question , the manual is available on the manufacturer 's website here : http : www.dhpfurniture.com eng products bedroom metal-beds details 3042-3236198-manila-metal-bed-available-in-full-and-queen-size under the product description you will find a product detail box- open up the instruction manual tab . you would need to refer to the instruction manual number ( im no . ) located on the sticker which is on the product itself . if you need further assistance , feel free to contact the manufacturer directly here : http : www.dhpfurniture.com eng support-home i hope this helps ! 
the metal slats are 12.5 inches off the ground . 
my 7 year old uses this bed with a foam mattress and we have had no issues . are you concerned about being able to feel the bars ? because you can not . 
the instructions say that a box spring is not necessary . i had both , and it does put the mattress higher than the foot board & you can only see about a foot of the head board , which i do n't mind . but the metal slats are pretty close together & can easily hold just the mattress . 
the instructions say that a box spring is not needed . i put mine on , and the mattress ( i have a pillow top ) is definitely higher than the footboard . the round finial posts are a few inches below the mattress . you can still see the headboard , but only a foot or so . i personally think it looks fine , just depends on your own preference . 
thanks for your question , the manual is available on the manufacturer 's website here : http : www.dhpfurniture.com eng products bedroom metal-beds details 3042-3236198-manila-metal-bed-available-in-full-and-queen-size under the product description you will find a product detail box- open up the instruction manual tab . you would need to refer to the instruction manual number ( im no . ) located on the sticker which is on the product itself . if you need further assistance , feel free to contact the manufacturer directly here : http : www.dhpfurniture.com eng support-home i hope this helps ! 
i got the same measurements , it almost fits across the width of my jeep 
i have one in my car trunk also in my 2 suvs . yes they hold grocery bags and keep them from tipping over ! love ours ! ! 
it is collapsible it does have hard sides on the ends of each cubbie . it does stand up on its own . 
yes , it does . 
yes . i have done this . 
here is a link to get the instructions and parts list for the metal futon ( dhp model 3228098 ) http : www.atgstores.com futons dhp-3228098-alessa-metal-futon-frame_g1578184.html 
hello chelsea , my mattress is quite heavy which made fold up hard but , you 've purchased a great steady product . you have to lift the back and kind of pull up on the front at the same time . stand behind what would be the back and try and lift close to end and pull up on front end while lifting back . mercy , took lots of practice for me . but trust it 's a great futon . you can do it . best , loretta 
the mattress would n't be flexible enough for a mattress at least for putting it in the seated position . the mattress should be a futon mattress for your best use of the frame . 
yes , comes with a hex key . you do n't need much more except an extra pair of hands . had no trouble at all , and no parts were missing . 
yes it does lay flat we have used it several times and no peaking in the middle . 
mine was missing parts also , you can go on the manufactory website and request the part . a parts list should of came in the package . it took about a week for mine to come in 
yes . when it folds down it is way over the side . as long as it will fold down without any problem it is correct . you have to pull the part you sit on up to get the back to fold down . if it works it is correct . merry christmas . blair 
put mine on the parts of the frame that get the most pressure , mine fell off so you really can just put anything soft in there 
no 
it 's been a while since i got this , but i remember a box approximately 3 ' x 7 ' x 8 '' , or fairly close to that . 
as far as i can tell you can not . 
black.. definitely black.. 
i 'm 6'1 180lbs and would n't mind sharing this.. but it would be a bit intimate . similar to a twin bed , but a bit longer ( my feet do n't hang off the edge on this ) . 
yes . 
pretty decent mattress 
the legs are a hollow plastic and screwed on to the bottom . i have not tried to lift it higher 
no . when it is set up as a sofa you can not lift the seat up . 
hi , here are the exact measurements : futon dimensions : 73.5 '' l x 37.5 '' w x 32.5 '' h lounger dimensions : 73 '' l x 46 '' w x 33 '' h sleeper dimensions : 73.5 '' l x 46 '' w x 14.5 '' h seat height from floor : 14.5 '' hope this helps ... thanks ! ! 
i believe it 's a vinyl byproduct . it has the feel and look as leather . i like this futon and it 's very comfortable . 
i 've had mine since december and have n't had any issues . it seems pretty durable for me . it does n't get sticky when it 's warm , that 's the beauty of fake leather ! i say it 's a pretty good deal ! i 've had two friends stay the night and use it as a bed so it 's been put to good use ! 
it sleeps a tall adult ( my 6'3 '' husband ) easily because it is long-however-not sure 2 would be so comfortable . i would compare it to a full-sized tall bed as opposed to a queen . to be frank-i would n't give it over 350 pounds combined . hope that helps 
i have had it for 6 months . there is almost no cushion on it , and it is already sagging in the middle . my butt goes numb after sitting on it for longer than an hour . 
i think it is around 120 - 130 lbs -- edited 
couch width is 22 inches bed form 42 inches arm of the couch are 32 inches cheers 
it 's poorly made futon that 's going to break down on you . do not buy ! 
i really thin polyester . after 3 months it ripped and the wire from the inside of the couch is showing . 
not exactly sure but i would say about the same length as a sofa 78inches 
they are black 
yes-it needs to be moved about a foot or so ; but it is not a heavy piece . seems sturdy enough-but not a queen sleeper like my prior behemoth was . same length from end to end ( if you scroll down on page dimensions are listed product dimensions : 78.6 x 34 x 31 inches ; 81 pounds ) weight limit 600 pounds sleeping but 2 would be a squeeze . we like ours ! does n't jut into the room or take over . a quiet , practical piece 
i would recommend it . the bed is pretty high and the platform frame is pretty strong . my kids have jumped on it and it holds both of them . 
yes 
no you ca n't there is one metal bar on the bottom . 
it 's bright white . 
avoid this bed at all cost ! 
yes it is but i wouldnt consider for an adult because is very light . it might last less than expected . i sleep there sometimes but my weight is aprox 127 lb not so heavy ! 
i can work with a foam mattress without a box spring . that is how i used it , however you have to be careful . use it on a rug , otherwise it will move around and the supports will give way . leading to the bed breaking . 
that is weird that it does n't say it anymore , but from what i recall it stated that you can fit a full or a queen size mattress . i have full size mattress and fits perfectly , i am not too such if a queen size mattress would fit without sticking out from the sides . 
10 inches 
it 's a dark rust color . it looks good . 
i think you can always buy bed risers but this bed was high enough to put my roll out plastic storage containers underneath it . 
yes they are . 
my queen mattress fits 
we love it the way it is ... ... the metal is slightly on the rough side ... ... i guess if you spray ! ! painted , it might work . good luck 
no , full size 
it should work for a full mattress . i have a queen , but there 's only a couple inches in difference . 
it 's 19 '' w , 11 '' tall and 14 '' deep . 
there are two finger hold spots just under the button if you put your fingers in ther an push the button with your thumb it does not move 
okay . i just looked in the little instruction booklet that came with the microwave . and i could not find anything mentioned there about turning the sounds off . so if there is a way to do this.. i do n't know how one would do it . so i guess no , probably not . sorry . 
the real dimensions are 18 3 4 long by 13 1 4 wide . according to the manual it says 19.1 x 14.75 x 11.5 which is wrong . 
the feet are 14 inches apart , side to side . the microwaves width will hang out 
yes , when you press the area to release ( open ) the door , the light does indeed come on . then when you close the door the light goes off . and then when you set the cooking time and start the mircowave the light comes on again and it stays on while cooking the food . hope that helped . ( if you have any further questions , just ask.. i will help if i can . ) 
it is 19 '' wide , 11.5 '' tall and 14 '' deep . 
no , it is made in china . we purchased one this year , and that 's what it says on the back . 
no , but you do n't need to . since the table is turned by a spinning `` gear '' that meshes with a matching outcrop on the bottom of the platter , all that you need to do is turn the platter upside down . that way the gear will spin without turning the platter . 
120v-60hz -- input 1350w output 900w 
yes , to both questions . 
20 3 8 x 12 5 8 x 14 1 2 
14.5 inches 
yes , the start button is actually an `` add 30 seconds '' button that will turn it on for 30 seconds initially and add 30 every time after . 
it is 20.5 inches wide by 14.5 inches deep and 12 .75 inches high . 
yes it does . it 's actually pretty bright . 
20.5 length across by 14.5 width . the height is 12 and three quarters if your looking to see if it fits under your counter . 
i am sorry but the diameter of the turntable is one foot in diameter so the 13 inches of your casserole dish might not fit . there is plenty room of room outside of the turntable it just might rotate with the 13 inch dish . i know one thing it is a great microwave . 
it appears to be a white colored aluminum metal . 
yes it is very easy to keep clean . i usually do not have spatters as i cover everything with paper towels or inverted plates . but one time i forgot . there was n't much spattering but what there was was easy to clean . 
you should , but they come pre-treated with mineral oil ... 
i do n't know the exact answer to your question . however , i purchased the small board from home goods and was so ill from the smell of it that i had to put it in my garage , then return it . horrible odor , horrible symptoms . if you have chemical allergies , exercise caution . 
when i purchased they were only treated with vegetable oil . 
i would think the dulling us so slight , you wo n't notice the difference . the boards i bought were for smaller items . i have a larger , end grain wood board for roasts , holiday turkeys , etc . hope this helps . 
hello bern44 , yes you can chop meat on these cutting boards . since it 's bamboo it is an anti-microbial product and washing them is very easy just use soap and warm water . any left overs from chopping meat is easily removed with a simple wash. sincerely , premium bamboo 
9 1 2 x 13 
no difference . 
wow , , , that was not my experience . the one i purchased worked perfectly fine . 
yes 
i am not sure if it would or not as i do not know what that model is . i can only say that if you find it takes a 7.2 volt battery , it `` might . '' i hope this helps though i have n't given you much to go on . i would suggest you do some searching online for the model you are asking about . 
no 
they do not make it in brown . we have red , white and black . 
it is loud . very loud . but it works very well . and it 's only on for a short while , so just put up with the noise . 
no 
i 'm sorry to say -- that it does not turn off . to me , that is a problem that eureka needs to address . if it would be a feature that will create a problem , just lay the unit down to raise the brushes . 
just set on low floor settings does the same thing . excellent suction , great for pet hair . 
yes 
eureka airspeed rewind pet ( model # : as1041a ) and airspeed unlimited pet ( model # : as3033a ) both have cord rewind . thank you . 
it says 10 amps . 60 hz . i have a small place and it 's good . the suction is good and also do n't have a lot of carpet . if you have a house with carpet all over i would n't recommend it 's light weight which is good but i think it could be a little better quality . i like it for what i need but i am glad i do n't have a lot of carpet to vacuum . maybe it 's just me because i am use to a dyson or heavier vacuum that i just might not be use to a lightweight vacuum . 
i do n't find it especially loud . not exactly quiet either but much quieter than my oreck upright . 
i do n't know the horsepower but if it helps any i put it by the curb yesterday ( it 's my scheduled day for trash pickup ) . '- ) 
no 
i ca n't really say how many but my son uses it on a regular basis and the co2 lasts a month at least . i get mine refilled at the local paint ball store and they only charge me $ 4 . 
you can refill the tank anywhere that sells food grade co2 . you can do a google search for places in your area that would be able to fill your tank . from our rough google search we did n't see a lowes store that can do an exhange for you . if you so choose , you can also purchase a `` exchange '' priced full co2 via our primo store webiste ( http : store.primowater.com carbonators ) . this will allow you to gain access to a $ 15 dollar discount . all you have to do : when you receive your new co2 , use the prepaid return label to ship back your empty co2 . 
this bottle is actually identical to the one used by paint ball enthusiasts and that is where i get mine filled . the store owner said it is the same one he sells to people who do that sport . i hope this helps you . 
i have this item and i get mine refilled at the local paintball store . they sell co2 . you can also go to a welding supply store that fills welding tanks 
no , this is not a two pack , this is a single co2 cylinder . yes , product arrives full . please refer to the item description page for more details . 
it 's a true twin fit , but when u put a twin comforter inside , it 's seem to be a little too small so it 's bunches up ? hope this help ! 
77 inches long . 
we can confirm that it is for the duvet cover sheet only , ( duvet not included ) , and a matching pillowcase . 
a duvet is like a large pillowcase for a comforter . 
yes and no . when the tank runs out of water , a switch that floats sinks and turns off the ultrasonic transducer ( the dime-sized disk inside ) . the front control and blower remain on . the floater is much better than sensors that sit in the water and need cleaning . 
the tablets made my humidifier stop working . 
our model only says hm2610 . there is no `` -u '' . this is an ultrasonic humidifier . our experience has much different from the `` minnesota nice '' reply below . we had an older holmes humidifier and this one is much better . very quiet and disperses a lot of moisture into the air . you just reminded me i told my brother i 'd send this information to him because he needs moisture in his home in addition to the humidifier . good luck with your purchase 
sorry , but i returned this item because i did n't want to have to continue to buy the tablets . 
no 
no . takes regular water . 
for parts and availability , please call us at ( 800 ) 546-5637 ; monday through saturday from 8 am to 8 pm , est . 
made in china . 
this unit has a 1-year manufacturer warranty . 
as long as you keep it clean & maintain it per directions . 
it stands 49 1 2 inches high . 
it 's on my full bed right now . i had no problems installing it . and i 'm also male , it matches all of the cherry wood furniture i have . i do n't see why would would n't be for a boys room . as far as quality , it 's rather light and flimsy . put together with wooden dowels and cheap screws but for the price i guess that 's about right . 
it 's not really shiny , more of a matte finish . 
no . the `` brackets '' should be on the bed frame , but it does come with bolts , nuts and washers . 
it is very good and strong it 's real wood so i think so it is strong . 
it 's solid wood . 
if they have bolts 
more of a red finish 
i am not sure about a full size bed . i use mine with a queen size bed , and it fits perfectly . very nice headboard . 
i never got that far to see if it really does , the description says it does though . i do n't think you should waste your time money on this item because it is made of particle board which means it is crap ! 
yes , i used it on a full-size bed and it looks fabulous ! the wood is beautiful . 
check to see if the frame has holes in it at the ends as that 's how the headboard attaches to the frame . most mattresses fit on a metal frame that adjusts to size , and this headboard uses the predrilled holes in a metal frame to attach to with bolts . you could drill holes in a wooden frame of a futon to make it work , perhaps , but that 's much more work than putting this on a predrilled frame and depends on having the right spacing in the wood and sufficient strength of the wood for these holes . 
yes it is , although if i were you i would make sure i had a 60-inch space for it , just in case . 
mattress + box spring . there was no problem with the height . 
height is 50 inches from bottom to top . we bought this for my daughter 's room and it 's very nice . 
i ca n't answer that i 'm afraid . i ordered it from amazon and it 's still in the box . too expensive to return . i ended up with a different bed frame . 
i understand your question and concern , and would not use an old decanter for the same reason . it should be leaded , but it is not . there are at least 4 manufacturers today in europe certifying they are lead free , and inspection verified ( technischer berwachungsverein , or tv is one ) and documented as such . this manufacturer is one of that group , and i accept that certification . the decanter looks very good in our living room hutch , and i get a few nice compliments on the shape and the lines . i keep a good cognac or aged premium cachaa in ours . i hope this is helpful . 
i poured an entire bottle in and it only filled 75 % of the decanter . i 'm guessing it 's somewhere around 40oz capacity . 
you can store it . or , you can pour it in right before serving . 
yes it is lead free , and the picture does n't do it justice ; much more beautiful in person ! 
yes , its lead free . 
sorry ozzie . i 've been out of the country . it is my understanding that this is leaded crystal . a very nice piece and good value , it joins others in our collection . 
i dont consider it blue at all , not ( aqua ) as it looks in the pictures . it is more of a seafoam green with darker teal outlines on the coral . hope that helps some . 
measured on the bed so not exact but seems to be 92 x 110 - use on a queen bed @ 90 degrees so it is long enough to encase pillows by folding under and then over 
i do n't know how many tread of it but it not too thin and i really like it as bed cover . for that price i think is good if you do n't have to pay for shipping . mine was not a good buy since i have to pay for shipping to hi . 
the biggest one fits about 1 1 4 c of substance . 
i 've used them in the microwave lots of times . 
i did not make sure they did n't have lead . i was a assuming since they were a major brand , anchor hocking , they would n't have lead based paint . they really cute 
they are not 
yes . i put mine on the top shelf and have n't had issues with cracking or breaking . 
since when did 120vac at 0.9a equal 275 watts ? try 108 watts . 
so far i 've only done meringue with 5 egg whites , to make buttercream , and also i 've beaten cakes up to 2 pounds of ingredients , so i guess it it powerful enough to beat 8 egg whites . 
no 
assembled in the usa . 
this mixer came with a 'kitchenaid ' bag for the accessories . it 's nice and sturdy . it has 3 separated pockets inside which i just realized today . & # 128512 ; . bag is big enough to fit the given attachments perfectly . 
sorry . have n't tried it yet . 
have n't tried . 
absolutely ! 
not had the problem but be aware that the beaters will on this model will only go in one position out of the two slots available it shows this in the instructions one of the beaters has a collar on it . if you try them the other way around they will not engage properly . best regards john 
i have n't done that yet , but i imagine if you do it long enough without your arm wearing out it would do the job ... .. 
it hasnt yet .

i do n't know . i 've never done anything to mine except use them ( i do n't cook a lot ) but they are still in good shape and stick free . 
i do n't see it anywhere on the cookware . unfortunately , i 've tossed the box away . 
coated aluminum . not `` cheap '' , certainly `` economical '' ; cook surface shows food stains more than some other , more costly brands . a good starter set . 
oven safe no- dishwasher safe yes . great non stick surface ! 
hi , i am sorry it took so long for me to replay ... i do not see any information about cadmium on or inside the box 
if you click on the picture the description on the box says that it is : ) 
hello steven i bought this set before three months ago and my wife always praise the set either for cooking or cleaning . but i wish there are different colors . regards 
sure . it has a flat bottom . 
setup was n't ideal , i bought this product but found another similar at frys tried them both and did n't like this one , i returned it and it cost me about 35 % of the 330 $ or what lever i spent on it just to return it . was a big hassle , and i would n't recommend . 
hello hon and thank you for your interest in our product . the adjustable heights , from the floor to the center of the vesa bracket , are 1100 mm to 1800 mm . please feel free to contact me for further assistance . thanks again andrea 
none to my knowledge 
yes - but the tv has to have a standard vesa style mount ( either the larger one or the smaller ) . you are likely able to find a smaller ( cheaper ) stand for such a small tv . we use this mounted to a 52 '' widescreen that move all around the building . it 's great . 
the stand does not come with any shelves . you would have to build your own to fit . there is only a single hole in the 3 small cross braces ; no holes in the upright tubes for mounting a shelf . even if you built something , using the single hole in the very back would not give you a shelf that could hold any weight . 
yes , it will hold a monitor up to 100 pounds ... it is very sturdy and well built : ) 
i honestly do n't know . we have it set up as a landscape and you can move it up and down or tilt . when i had a question about putting it together i called the manufacturer and they were able to answer my questions . i would call customer service . 
yes . must be rinsed well ( obviously ) . 
the lid comes off but i do n't know whether a cone would fit properly . i 'm on vacation and ca n't test it out . 
well david what i would is search on amazon for the part thats missing just type the name of oggi avalon parts it might show that part that you need or you could ask the person who sold it to you from amazon . i hope i helped 
depends on what you consider hot . i do n't think it matters in the coffee level . i would say maybe a couple of hours . it does not really keep coffee that hot for more than a few hours at most . then it is drinking temperature for me and too cool for my husband . it stays lukewarm for quite awhile . 
no . this carafe is stainless steel lined . 
china 
i just can say that my oggi device is not useful to carry away to outside because its lid leaks.it leaked all over floor of my car.i am not sure all of the products having same problem . hopefully i gave enough info about it . 
i have only used it for coffee . my bridge group enjoys hot coffee throughout our playing time . 9:30 - 1:00. i have never tested it for length of time but occasionally i have n't emptied it the next day and it is still warm . 
small without handles 6 3 8 '' with handles 8 5 8 '' medium without handles 9 1 8 '' with handles 11 1 2 '' large without handles 11 1 8 '' with handles 13 5 8 '' 
i 'm not sure , i have n't started making kefir yet , its on my list . the holes fit the tip of a ballpoint pen tip in them if that helps . 
do you mean the underside is a rough texture sort of like a cheese grater has ? ? ugh . if so , think i will pass on this one ! 
great question.. give it a try with the mixture of water for the epsom salt to freeze in a mold . post your result please ! 
too many styles of rocks glasses to be certain . the 2-1 2 '' diameter in the description is correct , so just measure the glass . 
the only `` markings '' are sometimes a small seam where the halves meet . 
they are so easy ! there 's a hole in the top where you fill with water . when it 's frozen , you let set on the counter for 3-5 minutes and pull the 2 spheres apart and voila , a new ice ball . i have heard using very hot or boiling water with produce clear ice . i have never tried it though , a friend told me it works . 
the sellers send it to you after your purchase . it 's in pdf format . great recipes ! 
hi ele the downloadable recipe ebook is automatically sent by email the day after purchase . i apologize for the late reply . dez cuzzina

hi luckas in order to avoid a crack in the middle , you need to ensure that both molds are completely dry before snapping together . the reason for this is that water expands when frozen which would cause a crack in the middle . hope this helps ! 
the packaging does not say bpa free , but it does say that it is 100 % fda grade silicone . 
two- they work great : ) 
yes it is 
almost all of the time ceramic glassware is lead free . the glassware you should watch out for is crystal-ware since the crystallization is created using a lead compound . this is especially true when the crystal is tinted . tinted glass is okay , but tinted crystal-ware is usually not . regardless , the problem is caused when you are using acidic foods and beverages within these containers since they can cause lead leakage . as long as you are using a fairly neutral ph in tinted crystal-ware you should still be fine . 
i was very pleasantly surprised that they do not ! ! ! i love my set ! ! 
the dinner plate is 10 3 4 and the salad plate is 8 3 8 
definitely red . 
i 'm not sure exactly but the bowls are huge ! 
i would n't say `` easily '' but i do have one that is chipped . it 's not impossible . 
i have n't been able to find them . - wanted some pasta bowls and ordered tequila and they matched pretty well . just a thought 
it is orange 
yes 
yes , ours did . whip , bread hook & general beater . 
the measurements are 12 ' in . high x 12 ' in long x 6 ' in . wide without the bowl and 10 ' in . wide with the bowl . you had the option of purchasing the extended warranty for 2 years at an additional cost . ( 15 $ for 2 years i believe ) the standard warranty when i purchased it from wal-mart is 1 year . 
not that i know of . the bowl that comes with it is designed to lock into the base . 
ours is not . did n't find a switch to chang to 220 . 
i think so . it has a three prong plug an i use it in my kitchen 
the mixture does mix well . the noise level is about a 5 or so ( no louder than our old sunbeam . the only complaint i have is that if you are using the plastic `` guard cover '' it is very difiucult to add additional ingredients with the mixer running . so i just cut it off and raise the guard and add them . if you decide that you want the smaller mixing bowl for this unit be sure and check with the oster people for the new bowl . i understand the small bowl will not fit the new model . 
25 oz . 
yes , that way when you pull it out by the handy handle you wo n't burn your hands . this is a great product ! i really do love it , the bowl is the perfect size . 
yes , it comes in a retail-type box . 
it is actually one bowl to eat serve from . the outer red bottom is so you can take it from microwave when hot , and i suppose hold inner bowl to eat from.third piece is just a top slatter sheild . 
not for sure , but i doubt it very much . 
this scale is pretty consistent at measuring small weights . i took a 10g weight and weighed it 5 times ( as per your question ) and got the same result , 10g each time . this scale is quite sensitive though , a breath or even a draft of air can make it fluctuate and give an incorrect reading , it also needs to be on a flat , solid surface for optimum performance . 
sorry but no , the lowest weight it can measure is 1gram . 
mininum weight 0.2 ounces maximum weight 11 pounds 
i just checked and it 's about 8.3in x 5.9in 
china ( answered elsewhere within this group of questions ) 
i do n't believe that this scale is the right tool for that purpose . is surface area is not large enough for measuring puppies . 
i have used my scale almost every day since it was delivered in september and have yet to replace the batteries . i imagine it is all down to time and usage , plus the auto-off after one minute of being idle certainly helps conserve battery power . 
there is no reference to changing shut-off time in the owner 's manuel . 
i checked the 1-p. user manual that comes with the scale , and it says `` battery : 2xcr2032 , '' which i assume means it takes two cr 2032 batteries . they 're cheap and you can get them at amazon ; i checked , and found 'em at this url : 
no only accurate to one gram . sounds like you need a triple beam or a very expensive digital . 
hello , since iphone4 does not support latest and greatest bluetooth smart hardware , so the answer is no . you need to have iphone4s or later hardware to enable bluetooth smart . you can check out this link for hardware compatibility matrix . http : ecx.images-amazon.com images i 71nc5itgw % 2bl._sl1500_.jpg hope this helps 
yes . it works on iphone4s or any newer iphone . thanks 
since iphone5s is running on ios7 or later release , our product is fully compatibile with ios7 on iphone4s iphone5 iphone5c iphone5s . if you still have more concerns , please email us at support @ wit-eshop.com . thanks steve your support 
no . it syncs with its own app . ios only , not for android . that is the down side ... but for the price is good so far . you just enter manually ... and that could probably be once a week ... 
sorry i do not know . i use wit scale app 
this attaches through the standard threaded fitting built into the propane tank . heater is supported by a bracket that attaches to the tank handle . everything is provided with heater , just add tank 
backwards threaded . screw to center of your valve opening . not like the plastic fittings that screw to the outside . 
yes ... very hot ! ! they wo n't touch it but once . 
per another site ( https : answers.yahoo.com question index ? qid=20081023082349aaiia4y ) there are 433,000 btu in a 20lb ( bbq size ) tank . at max , the mr heater is rated for 45,000btu hr . 433,000 45,000 = 9.62 hours of run time . at min , it is rated at 10,000btu hr . 433,000 10,000 = 43.3 hours of run time . 
yes . every heat lamp has a wing nut that you loosen to adjust the angle of the lamp . 
no it does n't . great heater though . heats two car garage in no time . 
your propane tank should have a steel collar surrounding the shutoff valve on top , to protect it from damage . the burner assembly attaches to the steel collar . loosen the hold-down nut on the burner assembly clamp until it slides down on the collar of the tank . then tighten it firmly and connect hose . 
i got mine for christmas last year after waiting several months . i would assume it is 2013. anyway i love it ... ... . 
yes you can , but it is only the two end heaters . the degree of turning is also only very slight . 
not recommended because of the fact that it has a propane fuel source . great for the deck or anything outdoors 
yes , it is threaded for a regular garden hose to hook up to it . 
yes it does . it slides out from the top . 
yes it does 
a small adapter hose comes with the unit and you attach that to a regular hose and run it out to wherever you want . it is a great unit ! 
unit is 10 '' x 14 '' x 20 '' . shipping box is 11.5 '' x 15 '' x 20.5 '' 
yes 
max db levels is 56 . 
we have not had trouble with noise . i am particular about this so i can tell you it is quiet ! our finished basement is approximately 1000 square feet . we can watch tv , play games without really noticing the machine . ours runs continuously . i do have to empty it more often than our last machine but maybe this one is just better at removing moisture ? our basement stays at a comfortable humidity level . ( & lt ; 50 % ) 
they are removable . when i considered doing so , however , there are three bolts on the bottom that protrude a bit beyond the bottom . it looked to me that the unit would be stable resting on the bolts as they were spaced far enough apart but i am using the unit on a polished floor so i decided to leave the wheels on . 
yes . 
amazon should have answered this . they sell a set of four extra stoppers for $ 9.99 . 
must have been a mistake . the price is $ 11.95 now . 
pull the know in and out to suck the air out . you will feel the resistance when all the air is out of the bottle . 
sorry i do n't know and never tried to find out . so far i have been using only one of the 2 stoppers because i do n't drink very often . 
no . it is plastic with silver color coating . very light weight . i did n't expect much for a device at this low price but it actually works quite well . 
i dont know , but i have not been impressed with this wine stopper -- it does not work as advertised . 
i went ahead and dug out my food grinder book and box and it says `` fga '' . i have used the new blade many times and have never had a problem with the fit . if it does not work for you , send it back . amazon has the best customer service in the world as far as i am concerned and it would not be a problem . 
i do not know , but it is standard hole , i believe all the cutting blade knifes has the same hole dimensions far all type of brand kitchen mixers . sorry that i did not answer fully ... . 
i do n't know about your machine that does work very well with my kitchenaid attachments 
i would tell you the dimensions but am unable to since i no longer have it . i used it maybe 3 times successfully . on the fourth use the blade shattered into five pieces . each of the 4 blades separated from the square hub area . that leads me to believe it 's just poor quality metal that caused the failure and not any manufacturing defect . my best advice is to spend more elsewhere on a better quality blade . 
sorry do n't know , used it on my kitchenaid grinder attachment . i know it does n't fit that . 
yes , a short hose with a male hose connector comes with the unit . you slide the hose thru a provided hole onto the drain tube and connect your hose to it . 
yes . comes with filter . 
yes , it does heat the room a up little but , since ours is in the basement , it 's a plus . i would n't say it heats the room up a lot but , since there 's a fan running to circulate the air , the entire room is a nice even temperature . cost depends upon the amount of usage but it 's probably comparable to a small air conditioner . 
yes . i 've washed mine just under water . 
the unit does come with a fitting but its for a smaller hose than a garden hose . you can take the fitting out to match it to a hose at a hardware store for instance . 
yes , a drain hose found at your local hardware store can be used . 
yes . it will turn back on and run until it reaches the desired level again or until the resevoir is full . 
90 days labor and 1 year parts . 
no 
set up of the unit is very easy . you unbox the unit , remove the drain tube from the water catch bucket , plug it in and set the humidity level where you want it and hit run . it will run until either the bucket is full or the unit reaches the humidity level you set 
i love this cartridge . i have made vinyl quoted for wood signs and they turned out wonderful . when you type a word out it is already lined up ! hope this helps you , have fun ! 
yes , it is possible if remove the letters and use the background as your template . 
any paper is fine . you can transfer the font or shapes to a chalkboard and trace it after its cut . 
it works with my cricut expressions machine . if the cricut takes cartridges it should work . 
you can adjust the size just like with all the other cartridges 
i 'm not sure i understand the question . this cartridge was a gift for my daughter , so i 've forwarded the question to her , but you might want to clarify what you mean by transferring the cuts to a surface . do you mean sticking them on a surface ? like tape or something ? 
i used my cricut to cut out letters . i painted the board i used white , cut out the letters in vinyl , and then painted over the letters in a darker color , then removed the vinyl to reveal white lettering on the board i used . these worked perfectly , although i would recommend using a smooth board like mdf rather than plywood or a canvas ( the paint will tend to bleed through and then you will need to touch up the letters ) . 
yes , you can wash them . 
it seems if you order by color , you get 4 same color . if you order multicolor , you will get 4 different color bags , as shown in picture . 
no , there are no dividers inside . 
one bag per shoe might work , but certainly not both shoes and still be able to close . 
no it does not but they stayed closed . i have not had any problems with my bags coming open . 
i received the colors that are pictured . 
my husband was able to get a pair of deck shoes into one bag , he wears a size 13. dress shoes are larger higher and required two bags . can put shoes in on a diagonal , but may not be able to pull drawstring totally closed . i found them roomy for my size 7 shoes . you get four bags per order , so i ordered two . it really depends on the type of shoe your husband will be packing . good luck . 
hi brian ... i would think so but i have not washed mine yet . i am expecting to do so at some point though . hope that helps ! 
yes - high heels , sneakers , danskos , boots , and even knitting . 
96 wrappers 
we carry these in white blue and pink . they have a groove that is the closure and yes they stay closed 
they have a pearl finish and are almost like plastic . they made an elegant display for an 80th birthday party 
no . they are thin and very flimsy though . 
yes they are . i 've put mine in the dishwasher and had no issues . i usually wash them by hand because they 're very easy to clean and i can re-use them sooner . but they can be put in the dishwasher 
they are constructed of very thin plastic and can be cut with kitchen scissors . i like this type of cutting mat because it is easier to transfer cuttings to the cooking vessel . however this type does n't hold up as well as cutting boards . 
1mm 
i have tried both ways and they work equally well either way . they certainly do n't replace a heavy wooden cutting board but they are portable & light and will be used as part of our kitchen camping gear . 
i chop and slice every day on one or more of them , using quality steel honed cutlery . i occasionally see small traces of knife edges , but nothing as you describe . i also put them in the bottom of my dishwasher on normal cycle and they have held up well . 
these do flatten after being rolled ; however , i would suggest placing a heavy flat object over them to speed the process . i rolled mine up and they flattened after about 30-45 min 
they have a very smooth texture , do not think it would be any problem with these . i just use them on all my surfaces to keep them cleaner , but hey are very light so will move around if that is an issue ? 
no 
i think so . i put them in the dishwasher . 
no . 
this vacuum performed poorly on my carpet , which is n't thick . it 's quite flimsy , and has poor suction . it also emitted a strong smoky smell . it may be better suited on bare floors , but it 's not suited for carpeting . thank you for asking . 
no , but it is very poorly made and many parts broke easily . 
if you bring up the expanded view and click the center image in the bottom row , you can see the cord is n't retractable , if the photo is correct . it winds around manually on the rear . 
aside from the pusher ( plastic ) and some o rings , this is all metal . i ca n't tell if every piece is steel , but the major pieces appear to be . 
i am not aware of whether or not this works with a hobart meat grinder . i use this with a kitchenaid stand mixer ( attaches to the socket in front ) . 
depends on what ypu are doing ? ? ? 
8 inches 
do not know , can tell you all parts are metal except the plastic feeder plunger . plunger is not heavy duty ... hollow with removable cap . unit works well . 
i 'm not sure what that model is ? we have the basic kitchenaid mixer with the screw down bowl . it works well . fits & attaches easily . the sausage stuffer tubes were ok. took kind of a long time . hope that helps . 
hi , you can use any 36w 2g11 base uv bulb with this unit . 
hi , yes that is correct . regards arthur 
hi we guaranteed the unit for 1 year and the bulb for 1 year as well . we have n't had any issues with these units , they are very good price and last long and provide great air . have a wonderful weekend . regards arthur 
hi , yes of course we do carry replacements for it . you can buy it from us using this amazon listing b00br25apu regards arthur 
hi , yes of course we do carry replacements for it . you can buy it from us using this amazon listing b00br25apu regards arthur 
hi , we try to keep best prices on amazon for uv products ! : ) give it a shot , these are great hvac units . regards arthur 
a certified remanufactured product has been taken apart and then reassembled at the factory while a refurbished product has just been repaired , probably not by the factory . it may or may not have been used prior to remanufacturing , but it has been completely retested and when it leaves the factory it should be fully functional . i generally assume it has had a higher level of testing than it did originally , but that is just my surmise . this is described at the bottom of this page : http : www.amazon.com breville-rm-je98xl-certified-remanufactured-extractor dp b005e0a1mi although this is a page for a juicer you will see it is a generic description of breville 's certified remanufactured process . i do not know why amazon does not have this information linked to the espresso machine , but they should . the factory warranty on my unit was 6 months - i did purchase the machine with a three year extended warranty since i was getting such a great price . the unit arrived in outstanding condition and it was indistinguishable from a new unit . it has been a great replacement for my 10 year old rancilio silvia which finally gave up the ghost . based on my experience , i would recommend you purchase a certified remanufactured unit with an extended warranty . best of luck . 
about two minutes from cup to cup . i only make two or 3 a day 
hi , i just purchased the same item as you did , ( i dont have it yet ) .. the bes900xl cerified remanufactured . also in the order description it indicates it as `` new '' . did you ever get any answers of the 2 questions you asked ? and secondly , did your second one work out and meet your expectations ? 
hello , just saw your question . the pillow shams are available . they are on another page at this point , we are trying to have the shams appear with the duvets for easier shopping . 
we washed and dried it before putting it on our queen-sized down comforter ... no noticeable issues with shrinkage or fading . 
the dimensions are as stated by the seller ... 88x92 . had to work a bit to get my comforter in but it fits fine.it really is pretty ! 
the duvet is green on one side and blue on the other , the pattern is the same . sorry that this is not clear from the description . this is a beautiful duvet . thank you for your interest hope this helps . 
the duvet is double sided blue on one side and teal on the other . the pattern is the same . we are adding more pictures and a better description to make this more clear . thank you for your interest . 
i will check with the manufacture . 
yes , under the home and kitchen category search multi batik tapestry . this is a beautiful duvet , i hope these pictures help . happy apple 
yes this comes in size 96 '' x106 '' , which should fit a king size bed . to find the bigger size search under multi batik duvet and the two sizes will be shown . the bigger one is $ 105 , free shipping with prime . thanks , earle at happy apple 
dee , the closure by button and i am sorry , i do n't have the dimensions handy as i am out when i answer this . hope you like it . 
as a matter of fact , it does . and if i have to say so myself , this microwave has worked exceptionally well , not only for the price but for its compact size . furthermore , i 've recommend this item to anyone who is looking for quality and budget in mind . only one flaw is that after continued use the add minute button as well as others button the type will eventually fade , but that is one flaw that should n't hinder your choice in purchasing this item . 
actual dimensions : 19.13 '' w x 11.38 '' h x 14.5 '' d 
the top and sides are black . i love mine . best microwave i have ever owned . 
it is 19 '' wide . 11.5 '' tall and 13 '' deep . i think it would fit on your shelf . it would overhang only by a half inch and that would be the door . 
the paperwork that comes with this unit states it is not suitable for mounting as a built-in . i am guessing that this has to do with the ventilation requirements . 
stainless inside . 
yes 
no . i have bought a lot of stuff on amazon for my family in the philippines . it usually comes from germany . this microwave is only rated for 110 us . sorry ! ! 
it looks plastic to me . 
based on the way my home is made i can hear it in the other room . it does not repeat , it beeps 5 times then shuts off . hope this helps . 
microwave oven is 20 '' 3 8 wide , 12 '' 1 2 high including feet , 14 '' 3 4 deep . sorry for the delay the oven is in my vacation home . 
it 's approximately 12 and quarter inches ... hope this helps 
ours turns at about ( almost exactly ) 4-3 4 revolutions per minute . we are very pleased with the performance of this oven so i guess that 's a fast enough turntable rate . if yours is slower , then you may want to pursue further action . hope this helps . 
yes and it is big enough to fit a dinner plate . i had a smaller one and it was just too small . i need to add that there is a timer feature that i use often because the timer on my stove is very low volume . 
about 40 inches . 
no . 
end 
i just hit it once but it burns it up . i 've had to just figure out the time and put in 1 minute 25 seconds manually . brand and type could be the problem , but it 's not auto . 
very easy to clean up . greasy spatters come up easily if cleaned up right away . 
each color has a different model number : white : 405.72122310 black : 405.72129310 stainless steel : 405.72123310 
yes 
from the ground up it 's 12 3 4 '' high , the width 20 1 2 '' , and depth is 16 '' . i 'd say add 1 1 2 more for the plug in the back so 17 1 2 total depth unless you do n't mind squishing your plug a little . update : i noticed stacy 's dimensions are a little different than ours . if you measure just the face of the microwave her dimensions are spot on , but we added the legs which jut out from under the face a bit , hence the difference in our measurements . you can take off the rubber stoppers but i would n't recommend it since there seems to be a vent down there . i think the problem with trying to fit static appliances in to custom spaces is you have to be sure you have room for proper venting and that the face aligns well with the face of your cabinet while the rest of the carriage aligns with your power source and existing cabinet shelve . the problem with microwaves is that they are rarely perfect boxes . the under carriage juts down about a half an inch with quarter inch rubber stoppers and the back of the unit juts out about an inch or so from the main casing . the plug is on the upper right side and sticks out about an inch . its right above a vent so i 'm not sure its okay to wind that cord in front of a vent when you 're placing a microwave into an enclosed area . i am by no means an appliance installer , so i 'd ask around and see what the pitfalls can occur when placing this off the shelf into a confined area . 
you first set the cook time and then select power level ; select 1 thru 9 to reduce power level from the default of 10. if no reduction is desired just start . 
hi , no this is not an inverter . 
it has pizza , entree , potato , rice , veggie and sensory reheat 
i do n't believe so 
pressing start cooks for 30 sec . there is also one button cooking by pressing 1-6 for ea respective nmbr of minutes 
it 's stainless ! 
20 1 2 in . wide , 15 in . deep , 13 in . high 
on mine the sound changes and is a little louder towards the end . have had no problems with it but wish it was heavier . every time i push the door opener it slides back a bit . 
you are absolutely correct , we messed up and it is a typo . they hold as follows : small holds 1.25 qts , the medium holds 3.5 qts , and the large holds 4.5 qts ( not to the border but a quatity you would would normally put in a pot without it spilling ) . i hopw that helps , and we have updated the listing to have to correct information . thanks for pointing it out . 
because this is a clay pot , they can not withstand immediate high heat . they will crack . the cooking temperature has to rise slowly . as an example , i would cook my beans by putting the pot in a cold oven with the food in it and let the pot get warmed as the oven warms to the temperature it 's going to cook at . as for cooktops , i would think you could but you would need to use a good sturdy heat diffuser and start your heat low until the pot is warmed and then increase your heat to cook your food . 
hi virgina , our cazuelas are made from very fine clay and may be used after slowly bringing some water to the boil and need no further curing . the cazuelas do benefit however from seasoning it prior to its first use , which can be simply accomplished by adding a couple of peeled garlic cloves to the boiling water use to cure the cazuela . the seasoning on the surface will increase with use ; adding its signature flavor to the items cooked in it , and over time actually become naturally nonstick and requires low maintenance . hope that helps . ancient cookware 
the inside cooking bottom is glazed . 
that is correct . the bottom outside area is unglazed . by the way , the part that is glazed is glazed with 100 % lead free glazes . 
the inside base of the unit is stainless steel ... there is no nonstick coating anywhere . btw it is easy to clean .

do n't know , but good question . the company should be responsible to answer that . 
there is only one small tray for poaching . you might be able to fit two cracked eggs in there , but only one poaching dish is provided . you can however soft boil 7 eggs . 
i had best results with a soft boil of whole egg . i did n't try too hard to get a good poached egg . 
i do n't recommend trying to scramble eggs in your electric egg cooker . it 's very convenient for boiling eggs perfectly every time , with hardly any effort . also poaching . but i 've never tried scrambling in my cooker . 
not real well . is soft boils ok in the shell but cup provided stills leaves some uncooked but i 've found it m akes a very good rice and small amount of vegatable steamer . maybe if you punched some small holes in cup tolet it drain it would do better ? but small enopuhg so egg wo n't leak through ? 
comes with a small plastic bowl cup you can poach eggs in 
it can steam 7 eggs in their shells at once , or poach 2-3 eggs ( out of shell ) in a little tray provided 
i ca n't say as to whether this egg cooker has had a design change..but mine has the plastic tray.. 
no you do not need a transformer to use it . 
i would say yes . the amount of water determines how long the eggs cook . the number of eggs does n't enter into the equation . 
the `` handles '' are actually the trays that you place the eggs on . my trays are white , exactly like all the pictures except the first one . 
it is 1 year . it broke in 6 months . 
you can use only 1 tier if you have only a few eggs that you want cooked . i have made eggs using single and both tiers with no problem . i have also cooked chinese dumplings using one tier , the best cook time is with the water level between medium and hard . 
yes ! exactly . just fill in the exactly amount of water of the small plastic container , and then pour the water on the black surface of the egg cooker . it should work ! ! 
it 's a small plastic bowl . nothing grand . would only fit 1 egg . 
yes . i generally set a timer for about 17 minutes then turn it off myself , just because i do n't want to forget and it does n't have any sort of beeper . once the water boils out it turns itself off . 
no , but it does exactly as it was advertised . my eggs always come out perfect . if i want it soft , then i measure the water to the `` soft '' line in the provided cup . if i want it hard , i measure to the highest level in the cup . this cooker never fail 
yes ; this little egg maker does an awesome job at making hard boiled eggs that are so easy to peel it makes you want to make deviled eggs every day . : ) 
mine is the same way . we have hard water in this area so i figure the residue is left over minerals after the water is boiled away . i just wipe with a paper towel . it has n't been a problem . 
no it is not . 
i would guess between 7 and 13 minutes ... it 's really easy when the water is gone the unit turns off automatically and the eggs are done its best to rinse them with ice water as close to when light goes of makes them super easy to peel . i love this gadget we use it often in fact just used it last night . 
not sure , we had to play with the water levels to get it right . if they are completely raw , you might have a defective unit . if they just are n't cooked enough for your taste , try using more water . 
yes it does . the bottom of the water cup has a needle like attachment . 
the one i have is 110v . do n't know if they have a 220v . 
no , you must turn it off once the done light goes out . about 15 minutes . it has n't been a problem as i 'm usually in the kitchen doing other things . 
yes 
yes . it does . sectional , chair , coffee table 
do not buy this ! ! its a lemon and the most uncomfortable thing we ever had the misfortune to sit on ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
no , it only comes as you see here in stock . you can do a custom order for another color , it takes approximately 12 weeks to make and the price may change depending on the colors and material . thank you 
this set is a top grain leather . then places you do n't normally touch are a leather match . this is a very nice set . home style for less 
yes it comes with 5 large cushions and 2 small throw pillows as pictured . thank you , home styles for less 
you can special order it other colors . it takes about 8-10 weeks for that . thank you , home style for less 
we just ship to points in the continental u.s with our free delivery . we can ship into canada for an extra charge . there are freight forwarding companies that will accept the items in the u.s and ship to other countries , but that would have to be arranged on your own . thank you , home style for less 
leather is top grain . in stock available only as pictured . 
never got chance to evaluate handle . it leaked so badly the very first time we used it so just tossed it out . was afraid that someone would get burnt . really poorly constructed . shame . it really looked nice . maybe good for decoration but not for use . hope that helps . 
yes , it does . to remove the coating , boil a solution of baking soda water in the kettle for about 20 minutes . use a soft nylon cloth and soapy water to wipe it clean of the remaining lacquer . if you can submerge your kettle in a larger pot of boiling water , you can easily remove the lacquer from the outside too . be careful not to damage the handle of the kettle . you can also use lacquer thinner available at most hardware stores . just wipe it off using a soft clothe and then clean your kettle with soapy hot water . in both instances , followup with copper cleaner for best results . good luck ! : ) 
no it does not whistle . however it is so beautiful you wo n't be able to keep your eyes off of it . 
if you look closely the lid has a small protrusion if you put that in first you should n't have any trouble . we have been using using ours for about three weeks and have not had any trouble with the lid . 
i bought this item as a gift and thought it was made in the usa ? the person i gave it to is more than happy with it , it is really beautiful and copper is the way to go for tea pots . this year i found some copper mugs to compliment it . 
this one is plated inside . 
this is solid copper , inside and out . 
yes 
yes , you should be able to . 
no , i never had one 
yes it is 
yes . either side can be exposed . 
yes 
i bought the pans for my daughter for christmas & luckily she still had the box . they were made in china . she is very happy with the pans . 
if you email the company they can get one for you . 
i love the cookware . am very happy with the quality and have had no issues in the 6 months or so that i 've been using the set . 
some of them are like one on the pot lids also fits the frying pan . 
the pans are not flimsy in the least . they are very strong , and seem to be very good quality so far . 
they are not safe on the stove , much less the oven ! they are not made to go in the oven as they do not do high heat well at all . i had pit the small pot on the stove just to boil water , and i came back and all the coloring came off the pot , and there was still water in the pot . so beware , and be safe okay . hope this will help.yo 
not at all . 
no , because the pots are made of aluminum , which is not magnetic . induction cooking uses magnetism to heat up the cookware , which in turn heats the food . these pots can be used on conduction stoves ( gas and electric ) . 
the set includes : 1-quart saucepan , 2-quart saucepan , 5-quart dutch oven , 8-inch saute pan and 9.5-inch saute pan 
yes 
absolutely ! do it all the time and put it in the fridge to cool later . had mine for over a year and have had no problems . 
it 's about 10 '' tall . it 's very lightweight and though it says it holds 64 fluid ounces , i 'm not certain it actually does . overall it seems quite small to me . i apologize that i have n't tried it out to make sure if it can or ca n't hold 64 ounces . i was a bit disappointed with this pitcher , though i will probably use this when i need another pitcher for when people come for any event . ... i think margaritas would look pretty in this pitcher . : ) 
there 's actually a mesh filter just under the cap so you can put the tea leaves right in the the piture to brew . 
i , personally , wash my pitcher by hand . however , i did go on their site and all of the glass iced tea glass pitchers indicated dishwasher safe . for the price and design , it is worth the purchase ; and they include a package of tea . the tea is so delicious -- i had a 1oz maharaja chai samurai chai tea blend . ( i drank it hot ! ) . loved it . 
i ca n't answer because we do n't have it anymore it broke in the sink while rinsing it out accidently hit the side of the sink 
i use hot water in mine 
yes it is as long as you have n't had the glass in the fridge , or have ice in it . 
the pitcher has only the teavana logo on it , and the box does not indicate place of manufacture either ( only distributed by teavana , atlanta , ga ) . sorry . i can only say that i had a similar pitcher that goes for $ 36 , and when it was broken , i was glad to find this for under $ 10 . 
if you have a smooth , polished steel ( not brushed finish ) or chalk board paint surface then i would n't use these magnets . they stick so hard that the only way to remove them is to slide them to the edge of the fridge and pick them off from there . i have a standard white fridge and the magnets work fine and have n't scratched anything . 
it is legal , but the field strength must be 5.25 milligauss or less at a distance of 15 feet from the surface of the package ( faa title 49 , part 173.21 forbidden materials and packages ) . and the package suitcase must be labeled as magnetic . if the package measures above this value , do n't ship it by air . 
i would think so , depending on what you 're trying to glue them to , but i have n't tried it . the magnets are really strong . i would definitely test it on one first to make sure the magnet does n't pull away from the hot glue when it 's stuck on a metal surface . i used the craft glue because i wanted to make sure they were really hard to pull off since they 're on magnets for kids to play with . 
they are very strong magnets but you may need a few for a 3 pound tool . will definitely work well for screw drivers , wrenches , pliers , and ratchets . hammers may require 2 depending on the weight . 
you probably can but may not like the outcome , the magnets are so powerful they will pull away from the fabric 
as for the weight i know it can , but some stainless steel is magnetic and other types are not . so it really depends on what type of stainless you have . hope that helps . 
easily . they are very strong . 
no . id get bigger magnets . these are very thin . i purchased these to use on magnetic blackboard paint . 
yes . two or one . 
i believe it might be a too strong . i think one magnet in the center of a 2 '' x2 '' tile would work perfectly . 
7 1 2 to 7 3 4 inches between shelves . 
i believe so . it 's very sturdy . 
yes-definitely . good size ones too . 
it is woven , but very even and flat 
38.5cm 
i have mine full of jars of spices and the shelf bottoms bow ever so slightly , barely noticable . i love it . 
no , it is rather flimsy . 
definitely . i put lotion , body wash and a whole bunch of beauty products on it plus use the first bar as a towel bar . i just used my own drywall anchors ( http : www.amazon.com mechanical-plastics-50125-snapskru-drilling dp b000f5mwsi ref=sr_1_10 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1392993557 & sr=8-10 & keywords=drywall+anchors ) to give it some extra support . 
27 x 40 
it comes rolled up in a card board tube . 
yes its 27x40 ... . hope this helps ! 
the packaging does not state if they are bpa free , may need to check with the manufacture . 
eight inches high . 
on mine there is no number inside the triangle . 
i do n't know , but they are pretty sturdy . 
pop the clamp up and unlocks . entire lid folds back while still attached at the back of canister . 
my husband undid the clasp and used the clasp to pry the top open . 
no . it is not designed for freezing . also the metal locking parts may become very brittle . try a softer plastic designed for freezing . 
the vacuum on the top when you first get them can be really strong . try using a butter knife and wiggling it between the top and the rubber seal . after you wash it and replace the seal , you wo n't have the problem again . 
did you try `` kitchen gaskets '' at amazon ? i think that they have them . if not , usd google to find the oggi url . 
yes , it sure will . 
the smallest rectangle adaptor would be 4 inch by 13 inch ... ... ... ... . 
the unit has an exhaust air outlet vent , consisting of exhaust pipe , adapter , window slider kit to exhaust out . i 'd say it is a complete unit . the only place i have to set it is in the living room for best use and i like it very much . 
the noise level is between 52-55 db ( a ) 
yes it does need to be ventilated but it only takes me about 5 minutes to do that . all your doing is running a hose out the window . 
the window kit only extends up to 52 inches . 
the data plate lists the wattage as rated input -- 980 watts . the voltage is 115 and the amp rating is 9.2 amps . if you have any other questions , feel free to ask ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
the pipe diameter is 5.5 inches , and the window length max , 50.75 inches . 
6 '' diameter and about 6 feet in length 
it comes with a hose . sorry i ca n't answer your question about the voltage as we live in an rv . however as it is sold in the usa i imagine it would plug into 110v . 
yes , it is quiet . 
yes , just make sure its thoroughly washed out . 
i do n't see why not ; just change the water measurements and use 1 2 of your yeast . 
no , with the cider you want to use sugar not the drops . the drops give no flavor or abything so it wo n't be sweet and it wo n't make it fizz either because it 's hard cider not beer . 
it comes with yeast . 
bottle says 100 % apple juice concentrate 
no not padded bottom- just like regular trays . red disc is silicone and removable . mine came with interchangeable black disc . yes you can serve with this tray . it is just the right size and prevents spills etc . when carrying to table patio couch etc . 
2 
i have had my trays for sometime and enjoy them . i went on amz and it looks like this style is for one shipping 2 pounds . style 40100613 , zebra is for two . i ca n't remember if i pd as a set . also , if you order over $ 35 s h free where qvc s h is very high . mine also came with a black silicone set to interchange . i have noticed prices fluctuate t o years - i hope someone else can give you a better answer . 
i got a queen shipped in to me 
in my opinion this bed has good support but definitely more on the plush side ( not firm ) ! 
no . it was just the mattress . i had to buy the box spring foundation separately . 
i would say comfortably only 3 . 
i little rough ... but it is amazing product . no complains 
granite : ) 
i took an uncooked white rice and over a period of several weeks i would crush the rice against the inner bowl . it takes a while , and some rice will jump out on to the table , or floor . i spent around 10 minutes per day , and i noticed the rice crushed easier on the second day . this method worked well but was time-consuming . 
unfortunately the origin of the stone is not listed on the box , literature or stone itself . it is manufactured in china . 
i has a combination . the mixed colored beading , two different shades of red , dark and bright , and the sequence comes off more like a burgundy . personally i think it is a beautiful piece . even my husband told me he really liked the piece . i am very pleased with it ! 
it sits really flat . i would recommend ! 
thanks your for your question , as this item is fulfilled by amazon , it follows our 30 day return policy . you can return most new , unopened items sold and fulfilled by amazon.com within 30 days of delivery for a full refund . our online returns center guides you through the process and gives you a printable return mailing label : 
this kit is made up of ( 2 ) 16in wide x 32in tall pegboard panels which , as pictured , combine for a total area of 32in x 32in . that being said , the panels do not have to be used together or side-by-side so you could mount them as a column for 16in wide x 64in tall storage area ( good for in a closet or narrow space ) or you could use the two panels separately for two 16in wide x 32in tall areas . the deepest hook is roughly 6in deep so the assembled kit would protrude from the wall roughly 7in if you used all of the hooks . 
there are about 18 hooks of various shapes and sizes . 
this particular kit can not be installed sideways . if you install this kit sideways the wall control accessories that are included with the kit will not work properly , only 1 4in pegs will still work and this kit does not include those type of pegs . 
i have 4 huge heavy pots , 3 smaller pots , mugs , and 6 metal utensils and its sturdy . use the anchors that come in the kit . i also tried to put my heaviest close to the edges anchors so they are n't pulling in the center . 
yes 
no , not even close . the actual boards are less than an inch deep . when using the longest pegs , they might be close to that . 
yes they can . i absolutely love mine and hope to buy more . 
hi maria , thank you for your interest in this item . the panels and roughly 20 hooks , none of the cooking accessories are included . thanks , susan 
to me , the item does not appear to be designed for outside installation . 
yes , but you would need to buy your own installation hardware from a local hardware store . the installation hardware included with the panels is only for wood or drywall , not concrete . the blue tapcon screws designed for concrete work well in concrete blocks . 
anyone who thinks the interior is all steel did not look carefully at all . r. roebuck is correct . i just received my kettle an hour ago , and while the bottom of the inside is steel the sides inside are entirely plastic . it 's a bit hard to tell because they try to make it look like steel , but after 10 minutes of testing i am 100 % sure it 's plastic ( different sound when tapped , different temperature than the steel bottom , etc ) . avoid this kettle if you do not want plastic touching your water . 
good question ... because i was wondering the same thing when i bought it . my last kettle was so loud , that my family would make me turn it off when they were trying to watch tv . this kettle is very quiet , and the whole family is happy now ! the only thing we had to get used to is that when it finished boiling it has a nice little chime that sounds exactly like our doorbell . it took a few days before people stopped running to the door when the kettle was finished boiling . 
yes 
as i mention in my review , while the bottom of the interior is stainless steel the sides of the interior are all plastic . it 's not obvious at first , and i can see why some people did n't notice , but about 70 % of the interior is plastic . if you do n't want toxic chemicals from plastic leaching in to your boiling water than i suggest that you avoid this kettle . 
i would recommend not doing so . i had a european one that i brought to the states . it died on me within a few months . find one for the 220v and buy that one . 
the reason we went for this one was the construction . we were tired of buying one electric kettle a year - plus having the no longer functioning one to add to the landfill or try to recycle . so far , i think we 've had this about 2 years and it is as good as the day we got it . if you are n't really looking for anything that can calibrate temp to the type of tea , boiling water on a hot plate , or even ( i mean , if you just want it hot ) heating in a microwave , or on a stove top works fine . we drink alot of teas and a lot of different kinds of tea , so having that feature works very well for us . 
right now everything is made in china . i think maybe even zojirushi has gone to china . i have a the kitchen aid kettle and it 's been great so far . several months now . it 's used constantly . keeps the water warm for quite a while so rewarming is fast . the price is high but i have replaced several other kettles in one year . well see how long this one lasts . 
it is whisper quiet . it plays a little noise when it has boiled . i 've had it a week and i love it ! 
no it does not . you just have to push the button on again and in few seconds or minutes , your temperature will at the right temperature again . 
no 
hi deborah , as i said in my review the full kettle set to the highest temperature takes 6 minutes to come to a full boil . lesser amounts of water or lower temperature settings will take a shorter time . i do n't know if geographic location is an issue for you . i am located about in the middle of the united states . judy 
i do n't see why not ! it is the same as any other kettle inside - i love mine - best kettle ever . 
well , my wife has been using it since christmas and absolutely loves the product . i just checked the heater plate and as far as power rating , listed as 120 volts 60 cycle ( hz ) , standard us home power . there is nothing at all about the eu 110 volt 50 hz standard . the power plug is a standard 3 prong connector attached to a relatively `` heavy '' power cable to carry the current requirement . as with any electrical product , safety first . it is a nice product . 
if by `` leak '' you mean escape from the metal canister at the shaft the answer is , no . i am 100 % with this unit for spice and coffee with no complaints . i do find that finer grinds accumulate under the blade and are more densely packed then above it and when that needs to be uniform i manually stir the contents loosening that pack with the back of a spoon and run the machine a second time for a more uniform grind . 
yes it does , they also include plastic lids for storage . love this grinder , use it frequently ! 
i 've been using mine for just flax seeds since i purchased it and it works very well . keep your seeds in the refrigerator and use the small spice cup and lid . fill it about halfway and grind then shake it and grind again . i store the cup in the fridge as well and add them to shakes and salads . 
the bowls are 4oz and yes they are small . frankly i would not recommend it . for the same price or less other brands have a larger bowl _ just one and they do the job just as well . i thought that because they have different bowls it will grind hard spices better but it is not . i would have returned it but was busy and then i thought it might be too late . buttom line not recommended 
i 'm sorry i do not know as mine is still sitting in the box , but i did buy it to make cookie butter , just have n't gotten a chance to do it yet . 
it is stainless steel but the side and edge of the unit is color black ( onyx black ) . 
i like it but , i take mine to almost fine , so not sure it can be controlled , to do coarse or fine , it does not have an adjustment on it . but , it does grind it very well , and came with 2 extra cups to interchange , spices , herbs ? 
yes , only 110v .

that is what is does 
you get a food processor with three interlocking bowls . there is an accessory kit with a storage case . there is one slicing blade where you can dial thickness from thin to thick . there is a reversible shredding blade and you can shred in two thicknesses . there are two chopping blades ; one for each of the two bowls you use for shopping . there is a dough blade and the dicing kit and a plastic pusher to clean the dicing kit . there is a spatula and a basic manual . there are no recipes in the manual . 
no . there is a plastic pusher that comes with the dicer and most of the debris snaps out . you can use a tiny brush or a metal skewer to clean the rest . with soft vegetables like potato , you will not have to do anything more . 
it is made of metal and it 's very heavy . 
there are actually 3 openings - each nested inside the next one larger . the smallest is circular and about 4 cm in diameter . the next one up is a rounded rectangle that 's about 7.5 cm by 5.5 cm . the largest one is a half circle - the point to point on the crescent is 16.5 cm and at the widest point in the middle it is 7 cm . 
the bowl and lid are not seated properly . this is for your protection . if the lid is not on properly you could cut yourself . first place the bowl on the machine without the lid . turn it until it snaps into place . then put just the lid on ( minus the inserts ) and turn until the lid is properly snapped on the bowl . then put the insert with the silver stick on it into the bowl . now switch the machine on . it should work now . please let me know how you make out . if you have trouble doing this , you can go to your nearby williams-sonoma . they can show you how . 
in the main bowl up to 10 cups of thin liquid and up to 15 cups of thick liquid , in the small prep bowl up to 4 cups of liquid . 
no . i asked the customer service rep at ka and there is no plans for a larger dicer . however , you can purchase the french fry disk . this produces a short rectangle cut . you can then cut those into two or three pieces for a dice . 
i think so , i know it can grate hard cheeses . i have only tried onions , celery , apples , bell peppers so far 
we ended up sending these pillows back . they were very firm and too large for our liking . i do feel like the quality was great . they were too large for my husband and i plus two pillows on our queen bed . 
the tag says only the case is . 
it 's soft , but it is firm . so it 's soft enough to be comfortable but firm enough that the stuffing never shifts or gets lumpy in spots . if he 's looking for barely there , then this probably is n't the best pillow , it 's very substantial . 
it comes folded in half and compressed some , the product dimension must be for the box it is packaged in . i have n't measured mine but would guess it is about 5ft long 
i'v used both the supplied cotton cover and i a velour type cover i got on close out at bed bath & beyond . both were very comfortable and were not hot . i only use it ( two of them , i 'm a side sleeper , so i switch ) as a neck down support pillow . i have another pillow for head rest . these or this pillow is very full and comfortable . 
the pillow is very lofty and will definitely keep your knees apart , etc . it is very soft , not hard foam . i had to take some of the fill out because it was too thick for my frame size . it is a very good quality pillow and i 'm happy with it now that i have it at the right thickness . 
i 'm 5'2 '' and the pillow stops around mid shin for me . i want to say somewhere around 4 and a half feet . i bought a pillow case that was 21 inches wide 54 inches long and it fits it perfectly . 
i 've only had mine a month and it 's still in perfect condition . 
sorry i do n't know . the cloth of the actual pillow feels the same as the zip case , but i ca n't check the tags for you since our pillow is out in our rv . i had no static putting on case , and then another case to match sheets over that , and i live in dry san diego . hope that helps . 
should be fine may get some clumps like a normal pillow . stuffed to the brink though 
it is very easy to open and close the lid . you do have to make sure that when you close it , you push it all the way down or it wo n't latch completely and will pop open . but , it does n't just pop open by itself . 
19.5 w x 11.5 d x 27.75 h. just let me add , i love it ! i do n't have a lot of room in my house and it fits perfectly . the sections for trash vs recycles are a luttle small ( approx . 9 x 9 each ) , but easier than having a bigger or multiple trash cans . hope this helped 
dear janina , thank you for your inquiry . the height of cw2018 with the lid open is 36.5 inches ( 92.7 cm ) . best , simplehuman 
stainless steel . very nice ! 
dear busy mom , the dimensions for our simplehuman touch-bar recycler are : 19.7 '' width x 11.4 '' depth x 28 '' height . please let us know should you have any further questions . if you would like to speak to us directly , please feel free to call us at 1-877-988-7770 m-f 8am-5pm pst . thank you , arnold 
hi , it uses the g size bags - both cans . the entire lid lifts off to remove the inner buckets and yes , you can remove one at a time . i really love this as we now have more recycle than trash on a regular basis . i am not sure the touch bar is as intuitive as you would think as on a few occasions guests have lifted it instead of pressing it and the whole lid crashes to the floor . no person makes the same mistake twice . 
the beauty of this can is that it has two lift out bins . no decvider . if you want a bigger container you would want to get a different model . i do n't think they make one big bag that would fit this . 
24l each 
the can has two liners . one blue for recycling and one black for garbage . you put the bags into the liner so you can pull out the garbage . we also line the black one for garbage but not the blue one . 
yes , the bump bar is rather large , and as long as you are n't extremely tall or short you should be fine . 
9.6 '' x 15.2 '' & 7.3 '' high 
i have been using mine for three months and no rusting so far . 
that 's what my wife does be carefull with the screw - it will strip the plastic mount easy i added a small o-ring around the screw to tighten it 
product dimensions : 9.6 x 15.2 x 7.3 inches ; 2 pounds this is right from the product specs on the page 
yes , it can drain to the back or the right side 
yes 
it swivels so you can just turn it inward to place in your sink 
it can be removed as it is not attached it just sits on the frame , i do n't know if it is dishwasher safe 
yes it 's stainless and shows no signs of rust . quite a compact rack . i would go the next size up if i had to choose again . overall , it 's a good product except the draining piece broke off . i talked to customer service because wanted to have it replaced . they told me that i have to first send it back before they can send me another . i have n't done it that yet because then i would have no where to dry my dishes . there customer service needs some work . 
the spout is not adjustable [ pull push in out ] but the spout is 1 '' longer that the legs so , it may work with your sink it works fine with mine 
my boys use them to play their xbox 360 games . 
my son has one and it is durable . i bought it for him a year ago and it is wonderful . he is 25 and about 140lbs . 
about 2 ft off the ground.good size to sit in when playing , , , 
my bother is 6'1 and 140 he says it is very comfortable for long periods of time . he 's a gamer so he sets in it for hours on in and loves it . 
i could n't tell you the exact weight , though it 's very light , the storage compartment is under the entire cube under the seat and it is not wireless 
yes you could but the chair is made for a small child and is very uncomfortable after 10 min of sitting 
my son uses the chair and he weighs approximately 210 lbs 
oh yea of course , im 6'0 '' 193 but the system in there sucks ! i bought my own speaker set and replaced them and added a subwoofer in the bottom compartment and now its the way i hoped ( : but was dissapointed when it first came in 
i got it for my son who is about 155 lbs and i weigh about 230 , so i know it can handle that much . i hope this is in your range . my son loves the chair and is always raving about it even though it is a piece of furniture . 
no it doesnt.. 
absolutely fits car cup holders . these have really held up well for me compared to others i tried 
hard acrylic , not flexible 
i bought a pack of replacement straws at walmart , and they work fine . 
absolutely ! all our products are 100 % bpa free . 
i have only washed mine in the dishwasher and it has worked fine , even after having spoiled milk in it . i suggest putting the straw standing with the silverware so that the water can shoot through it an clean the middle . otherwise i put the cup and lid on the top shelf . 
the set i received ( and returned ) did n't look anything like those in the photo , however i doubt that either set would stand up to hot temperatures . 
yes the straw is thick enough for a smoothie 
i am not aware of a way to take them apart . one of the two cups developed water between the two walls and was of no good to us . i do not recommend these cups . 
yes . one for each . 
no , the cup is one solid piece . the only detachable part is ( of course ) the lid . 
i have n't tried it in there but i do n't know why you could n't . it does work well in a regular oven though . i have n't tried it on broil because i would n't think you 'd need it . a toaster over is an oven so i do n't see why not . i just did n't want to cut mine because i use it with a larger pan . 
no . this is to use in the oven inside a baking sheet . it stops your food from sitting in grease while it cook . it 's hard to clean after . 
there is only one and fit approx std cookie sheet 
i 've never seen mine smoke so i do n't know what to tell you . what does the website or box say about it ? 
the raised portions are about half of an inch high . 
yes , my daughter gave me one and it works well in the microwave , just be sure to put a paper towel over the bacon to cut down on splatter . don 
i 've only used it in metal sheet pans , but see no reason why it would n't work in an oven-proof glass container of any kind , up to the 428f suggested limit . however , i stopped using it after just a few times due to being unable to clean it properly and having food and grease stick into the crevices even after hand washing and repeated dishwasher cleaning . i would not recommend it based on my own poor experiences with the product . 
i do n't have the packaging any more so i ca n't say for certain if it said bpa free , but the way i understand it bpa is a plastic based issue and these mats are food grade silicone , not plastic . 
china by a highly reputable company to standards set by the dr. richard 's company for not only the us market but worldwide . 
it is 10-gauge heavy duty peva so it is not recommended to machine wash it . it is , however , quite possible to spray it with any biodegradable cleaning solution as it hangs and just wipe it down . 
72 inches x 71 inches 
unfortunately no . 
three . 
it is not clear . it 's not white either . very thick heavy duty frosty , which is really nice . not wrapping you around with the steam ! stays put in place during the whole shower time ... and i take loooong showers ( 30-40 min ) 
right . china . 
100 % polyester filling and cover . 
unfortunately , i did wash it in the washing machine and one of the decorative pillow cases was ruined in the washing machine . the fabric is delicate so i would n't recommend it . 
i maybe wrong , but i do n't think this included sheets set . it is a comforter , bed skirt , four pillow cases three decorative pillows . ( if there was a sheets set , it will be total 13items ? ) 
i just put in my regular washer and it 's always fine 
2 pillow cases , two euro size pillow cases , three small decorative pillows and bed skirt . 
off white 
i have not bought it but the dimensions are under item description . the queen comforter says its 90 x 90 , the bed ruffle is 60 x80 . hope that helps . 
yep ! 
markers are sold separately . 
there are 144 labels in my package . 8 pages of 16 . 
there were 144 label stickers . 
from the inside bowl it is 10 inches and from handle to handle it is 13 inches . hope that helps . : ) 
no they are slightly flat on the bottom 
a i 4 inch drill bit fits snugly into one of the holes 
the holes are too large for un-poped popcorn kernels but okay for most popcorn . 
this `` thing '' is an adapter that goes onto any standard `` paint ball '' co2 canister bottle so that the bottle can be used in place of the co2 cylinder that came with the sodastream . the cylinder that comes with the sodastream has a non-standard head that screws into the sodastream . using this adapter allows use of a standard paint ball cylinder bottle at a fraction of the cost . standard paint ball bottles can be refilled at most sporting goods stores for $ 5.00 give or take a dollar . the sodastream bottles must be sent back to sodastream to be refilled or exchanged at a cost of $ 25 - $ 50 depending on the size of the bottle . this adapter goes on top of the paint ball cylinder and allows it to screw into the sodastream machine . works great ! ! ! 
it uses a standard , 1 16 '' hex allen key . these are available at almost all hardware stores . 
the penguin model uses the 12oz tanks . 
i take my tanks to my local propane gas vendor and their co2 gets delivered as `` food grade '' or `` beverage grade '' . i 'd check around ! 
i do n't know what a fizz chip is as my unit does not have one , but i can try to think this out and hope i do n't coming across wrongly . if your vehicle had a 12 gallon fuel tank and you replaced it with a 20 gallon one and this tank came with an adaptor , would your vehicle still run and all your radio and electronics in the vehicle still work ? i would think so . side note : what i ended up doing was going to roberts oxygen and purchased their large syphon co2 bottle , i think it was a 25lb bottle , for $ 220 filled with co2 . i then purchased a refill tube , 24oz paint ball bottle and a scale from amazon . i now refill the paint ball co2 canister in my garage . when i run out of co2 in my 25lb tank , i can exchange it for $ 30 with another tank filled with co2 . so , my initial total cost was $ 400 . but now , the refills are not $ 15 per 16oz bottle , but $ 1.20 per 16oz . breakeven for me is 26ea 16oz bottles , about one year . after that , my gassed water will cost me $ 30 a year . my breakeven point is actually sooner as i do n't have to drive around , spend money on gasoline and my time to exchange the bottles . hope that helps . 
it appears well-made but we have lots of trouble adjusting it ... have lost 2 canisters of co 2 trying to get it right . any advice ? 
pd , if you have adjusted the center pin per the instructions ( you can also watch the youtube video for help http : youtu.be uqv0ns2vn_k ) and you are still having a problem please feel free to contact us at 800-492-8221 and we can walk you through the process . sodamod 
i am confused . the reason for buying the adapter is so that you can use paintball co2 canisters which are way cheaper to fill . your soda stream canister already fits in your soda stream machine . 
the largest tank that genesis can support is the 12oz tank . 
i think it is reverse thread . 
hi . i do n't know what 'european style ' butter is but i can give this description of the dish . it is considered oversized in that the plate part is wider than most you 'd find . the lid bows out slightly on the sides so it is a bit wider . it clears a quarter stick by far but is not tall or wide enough to fit a whole pound of butter . it is best suited for only a quarter pound stick and being oversized is really just for being decorative and sturdy . hope that helps ! 
about 3-1 4 to 3-1 2 '' 
not wide enough 
yes , it does . 
the colored seals you see in the picture are either a soft plastic or rubber and if i remember the packaging i think it said bpa free but i think it was talking about the stainless steel . if you 're worried about the rubber or possibly sharp edges ( someone else commented on possibly sharp edges ) then i would remove the rubber bit and before giving them to your kids you can take the mold and plate off the stick ... this way the parts also do n't go missing . 
i googled the metro co and got : `` for over 80 years , intermetro ( metro ) has been the world 's leading manufacturer and supplier of storage and transport products in the food service , commercial products and healthcare industries . founded in 1929 , the company is headquartered in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , and has offices throughout the united states and internationally . '' so , that still does n't say , but you could call the company and ask . this product is wonderful . i used it to make green smoothie popsicles all last summer ! 
i have n't had a problem with the ones i ordered . i do not see any seams in the molds . 
it holds four ounces of liquid filled to about 1 4 inch from the top . pretty big . 
i could n't say as i have n't seen the other brand , but i can say that these are by far the best popsicle molds i have ever used . they release quickly and clean easily . i would recommend them to anyone . 
not sharp at all . i do n't see how a child could possibly get hurt with these . have you looked at the silicone ones ? i bought a set of each , these and the silicone ones . 
they are lead free . they are very well made and the holder is too . you get a few extra small parts . 18 8 stainless steel is a good strong material that wo n't bend or leach anything into what 's in it . 
no 
i made blended raspberries and vanilla yogurt together and was pleasantly surprised how tasty they were . when you thaw them out just run them under warm water for 2 to 3 seconds and they come out nicely . i have not froze yogurt by itself but i am sure it would be fine . the portions are nice also ! 
you get 6 replacement bits with your purchase . i have n't needed to use any of the extras yet . 
ice cubes 
yes , i would do half a batch and half the ice . when the ice stops , blend it yourself . 
bottom of my 600 model says 450 watts 
we 've only used it for frozen adult beverages ! ! ! 
yes , if you want to transport your machine it is a must ! so easy and keeps it clean . also protects the machine ! 
i have n't tried it , but check out this website for simple and inexpensive snow-cone and slushie syrup made from kool-aid , sugar and water : http : www.theblackpeppercorn.com 2013 06 make-your-own-snow-cone-and-slushie-syrup 
this model has a metal shaver for the ice . 
& # 304 ; recommend you to use syrups of monin for margarita . 
it appears to only come in one size motor i can not find another motor size or model different . the design is similar to the island oasis machines that professional bars use . it shaves the ice into the blender and then the blender blades blend and cut the ice to make that super smooth drink like you get when you go out . 
yes it works very well with frozen fruit i make at least 3-4 frozen fruit smoothies a week.. love this machine ! 
i do own both styles , the lidless ramekins and the lidded cocottes , if that is what you mean . both are 1 2 qt , and the same height of approx 2 1 4 '' but the cocotte has a slightly larger diameter of about 5 '' whereas the ramekin has a diameter of about 4 3 4 '' ( these diameters do not include the handles ) . the biggest difference , other than the lid of course , is that the cocotte has a thinner wall and weighs less and has a thinner , slightly fluted lip ( to provide a tighter seal with the lid i 'm thinking ) whereas the ramekin 's walls are completely straight and thick ( the ramekin is noticeably heavier ) . i do n't know their exact weights , but i do know the shipping weights are different ( 2 lbs for the cocottes and 3 lbs for the ramekins ) . i have n't tried either one so i do n't know the benefits differences of one vs the other . i hope that helps ! 
2 small pots with 2 lids . they are quite small . 
i would think so . they are pure stainless . 
actually , no , as they are different diameters . 
the fabric continues throughout the piece . 
the cushion is removable . it 's attached with industrial grade velcro . it does n't move at all . 
just one . it 's super easy to put together ! the only thing you have to do is attach the legs and viola ! finished . 
175 lbs 
53 inches 
36 inches 
shelves are pretty sturdy and can hold quite a bit , however as a whole the structure is n't . almost broke it carrying out of the apartment when moving out as it 's it 's susceptible to being twisted arc when held from both ends . 
i had to look them up online . but they refused to replace the part that was damaged 
the shelves are about 10 3 4 inches each . hope this helps . 
yes finished on both side . it has supports on the back side but i do n't think they look bad 
product dimensions : 43.4 x 11.5 x 75.5 inches ; 81 pounds 
sorry- no . 
as far as i know , it should fit evian bottles perfectly . in my case , i 've been using kirkland water bottles and work just fine . 
we are very sorry for this inconvenience . we 'd like to replace the humidifier with an updated version . please email support @ satechi.com for further assistance . thank you , satechi technical support 
mine came with two , but i imagine that it can vary depending on where you purchase it ? it told me in the description on mine that it was coming with two . 
if it fits . it 's designed to fit loosely on the top of regular clear water bottles . 
i have a filter i use for essential oil ( i personally love using lavender ) and a separate one i use for plain water , plus i get new ones every few months just to keep things healthy . you can also rinse the actual bottle topper piece in between oil and non-oil use . 
yes . the filter extends down into the bottle . without it , there is no way to draw water up into the device . 
yes . the filter extends down into the bottle . without it , there is no way to draw water up into the device . 
yes the filter not only cleans water but acts as a straw to get water up to the humidifier 
i get the full 8 hours before auto-shut off , even though the filter does not go to the bottom . 
no , it is part of the operating unit 
perfect . its work very well . 
yes put the remote in a higher place or get another remote and take the batteries out 
work with an lg split 
it works good ! 
do n't know exactly , but it is about a medium size . it works excellent and it was very easy to program to my ac unit ... .i recommend it 
i have no idea . i got it for a trane ac and tried out all 3 codes but it did n't work out ! 
no 
yes it will 
no 
yes 
made in china 
i have used it successfully many times up to 450 degrees . 
definitely yes . it would work perfectly . 
no ! 
hi , you may not want to roll out dough on this mat because it does not have a very large circumference depending on the size that you need but it is very possible as the mat will not slide back and forth at all . the mat is sticky though and i have found that i was better off rolling out my dough on my countertop . i hope this helps : ) 
this is a set of 8 wine glasses-its a good deal 
we do not carry water goblets . 
yes 
yes i do 
the glass is 9 & 1 8 inches . these are fantastic glasses , i bought three sets ! 
this popper is awesome . it surpasses it 's predecessor for sure ! it 's easier to use ( love the on off switch ) , the hot plate is easily cleaned and is a lot lighter to lift when turning your bowl over . i would highly recommend it . i 'm so happy i did ! great popper ! 
the instruction manual states to use vegetable oil- no more than 3tbl spoons . i use coconut oil 1tbl spoon and 2 3 cup popcorn . popcorn always tastes good-no burnt popcorn : ) 
they did make improvements on the bowl . it is noticeably stronger than it used to be . that was a concern of mine as well . the removable plate does n't seem to heat up in same amount of time the older model did . but the difference is minor . being able to clean it properly is worth it . have n't seen a bit of yellowing . i 'm happy with mine . hope this was helpful : ) 
the surface is a light weight metal , and is `` non-stick '' , but i ca n't tell if it is teflon or not . it does n't look like it to me , but it is the same color as the teflon pans . 
i just went to west bend site and i do n't think so . i would email them directly . i usually look for bpa free things too . good luck . 
hi laura , this nonstick baking mat works with temperatures between -40 f to 480 f. because the mat is nonstick , it is extremely easy to clean . many times , you will find that simply wiping it down with a paper towel is sufficient . otherwise , just wipe it down with a soapy sponge and rinse the mat with warm water . 
i would n't expose it to open flame , but perhaps if you put aluminum foil under it . 
this product is manufactured in china and is made of 100 % fda approved materials , including a high quality fiberglass core and food grade silicone . 
this silicone baking mat measures 11 5 8 x 16 1 2 inches . one mat is included and it fits a half size baking sheet perfectly . 
hi jan , the measurements are 11 5 8 inches x 16 1 2 inches . 
you rinse the filter . there is a switch you turn to bare floors . it 's a great vacuum . highly recommend it . 
slide the canister lock to the unlock position and remove the canister by pulling it forward . 
no . but , i love it anyway . 
12 amp , perfect for carpets & hardwood floors . 
i just got it , so i am not sure . maybe bissell can answer that . 
i do n't have hardwoods , either , but you might find it helpful to know that she is no delicate beast . this vacuum is rugged and the brushes are tough . my laminates take a beating if i forget to rotate the switch to the correct flooring level . maybe not so good against the finish on your floors.. ? 
i returned mine , the dimensions stated were different than in reality , did not fit my space , sorry ca n't remember what they were through . 
black 
same , i just had to sort of figure it out . 
top shelf =36 in.x 12 in . ; middle shelf is17 in . x 7 in . ; bottom shelf is 23 in . x 11 in . 
it is finished on both sides , so you do n't have to place it against the wall , however , i think it looks better when positioned this way . 
the bottom shelf measures about 23 '' x 11 '' deep . however the depth from the back board to the two 'legs ' which attach to the self is 8 inches . the space between the two legs is 17 inches . hope that helps ! would be glad to try to clarify if that is stated in a confusing way ! we have the table in our front entry and like it ! 
13 1 2 '' width x 9 '' length x 2 '' height 
17 '' w x 7 '' d x 9.5 '' h 
yes , it is pretty sturdy . 
12x34x36 
absolutely , i 've never had an issue ( top rack ) . 
as long as you push the top on good and your kid makes sure to close the lid , it will not leak , even if tipped over . 
no . i have 4 and i 've never had that happen . 
it 's a thick , somewhat flexible plastic straw . it 's actually a few separate plastic parts that make up the straw and the seal . all can be removed for thorough cleaning . we have n't had the need for replacements in about 3-4 months of use . 
if you purchase from me you should be able to get it shipped to the uk . try adding it to your shopping cart and see what the shipping will cost . 
according to their main website , it says it is made with american materials . i do believe the product is from oakville , ontario canada . 
`` juice in the boxes are made with highly durable tritan , a food safe , bpa and phalate-free material `` 
no , i would n't use this for smoothies . the straw is narrow . juice would be fine , but not smoothies . 
( width x depth x height ) 2.5 x 1.5 x 5.5 inches ( 6.5 x 4 x 14 cm ) 
the inside is plastic . 
the lid does not screw on or snap on . it 's like a rubber seal that adheres to the top of the mug when you push it down . and yes , there is a straw hole . the tab you can see in the picture covers the hole when if you prefer not to have a straw in it . btw , i suggest getting extra long re-usable straws , like they sell at bed , bath , and beyond for tall tervis tumblers . standard straws are just not long enough for this mug . 
yes top rack . mine has been washed several times in the top rack . my newer models top snaps on but onlder ones screw on . either way seal is perfect . i own 3 of these 
no straw included , although any straw would fit . and the lid is pressure fitted , it does not screw on . i spent 2 minutes to learn that . 
yes , perfectly ! 
yes a straw is included 
bang the top like a jar . sometimes pressure builds up . 
yes no prob 
no it is not stainless steel inside . it 's all plastic . 
no way lulu ... ... it 's a bubba keg ! ! ! you could put it on the passenger seat and it will sit just right . 
yes it does 
yes , it is flexible enough to fit from about an inch to and inch and a half or a little more . that part that angles in will spread out . 
1 3 4 inches , but could the opening could possibly stretch to 2 inches . 
it has give , , , i would say yes ... we love ours we have two ... in the bathroom 
it 's envelope style but in addition there are ties that keep it fastened . 
hi again jennifer the shams do not include the pillow inners regards taffy 
sorry , i only bought the euro shams . no idea on the rest of the sizes . 
thanks for your interest in our product . the euro is 26 '' x26 '' . 
it is a nightmare to clean if you forget to rinse it for a day or two and any bacteria or fungi have started to breed . there are several places that i think most people do n't even think to look at when cleaning , and they would be shocked to find what is hiding in them . i am actually online at this very moment looking for a new , easier to clean humidifier , to replace this one . there are some areas that are impossible to clean that are a result of blantantly poor design . like a random small ridge near the bottom of the inner column inside the tank . i very regularly disinfect then entire unit , but there are still areas that will get a brownish film to them after a while , one of the main ones being the floor inside the water tank . most of this can be removed by very vigorously shaking the tank for a few minutes after placing a cup of uncooked and a cup or two of water inside . but there are a few places ( like that ridge i mentioned ) that ca n't be effectively cleaned by any method . 
if you use tap water this will happen with any humidifier , you need to use distilled water . 
about 3 4 of a gallon of water ( i buy distilled water by the gallon ) , it will run on lowest for several days without refill . 
so i looked over the box and instructions but it does not have any information on what it is made of . i would say it is not bpa free because they would have it clearly written on the box . 
about a 1 2 gallon . lasts all 10-12 hrs at moderate settjng 
i used an essential eucalyptus oil in it . not more than half a dropper worth , but it was enough to basically corrode the plastic on the inside of the humidifier . this was my fault ! not at all blaming this otherwise stupendous product , as i just bought a replacement , but i essentially ( pun ? ) wrecked my previous one . learn from my mistake . 
cool . i was surprised ! 
there is an off on indictor light on the front , very small . no light that illuminates the plastic area . 
i do not find it noisy at all . i am very sensitive to noise and have to keep my air filters at the lowest setting ( and some brands even the lowest is too noisy for me ) . this humidifier does n't bother me even at higher settings and i have no problem sleeping soundly while it is on . 
yes 
15 3 4 inches . part that hangs on wall is 17 1 4 inches . 
yes 
they use standard bolts , nuts and washers.. they are always packed with the bracket but may have fallen ff during transit . can you get some from your local home depot ? 
that is a possibility . they have rubber pads and you can add even more to reduce the risk ... your call . 
i used on my 9000 btu frigidaire . i think these are universal . 
simply place it flat against the siding and bolt it in . we did it and it worked perfectl 
this should . i did a 12k unit . the bolt holes give flexibility for many different sized units and it should support the weight . it was pretty easy to install and comes with concrete anchors if you need them . i put mine into wood so i just got a few long stainless wood screws . 
yeah i mounted my 18k on if and it fit beautiful 
i purchased 2 27000 20 seer unit and i am very happy with them . i am a certified a c mechanic . i mounted one condenser over the other using one set of brackets . i had to modify the installation . specks specify the the condenser is to be mounted 11.5 `` from any wall but the brackets only allow 8 '' so i purchased the shocks and mounted to the wall and then the bracket to the mounts . just for safety i installed a long lag thru the mount directly into the side of the house . if the rubber mount were to fail the lag would act as a safety . i think if i were to do it again i would have the had the brackets made to accommodate the specks . it 's working fine but it ' only been installed for 2+ months . the units are fine . 
enough for air flow . they work well . 
it has an ordinary 3-prong plug 
8 oz . love this machine 
seems to be pretty much the same machine . 
plastic 
yes . mine sits on my counter 
plastic 
4 oz . you can fill with 1 2 cup of unpopped corn . 
dust mites are n't harmful to people but can cause allergies . the barrier blocks skin particles from getting into the mattress , cutting off the mites ' food supply so they decrease in number . you may be thinking of bedbugs , which do bite and for which you would need a fully encasing protector . 
this is actually like a bedsheet . it may take up 2x the space of a regular one since it 's thicker but do n't worry about not being able to fit it into a standard household washing machine . 
it 's best to wash before using ( which is true of all textile products ) . avoid washing with sharp objects , such as zippered items . you can use a dryer , but it must be set on low heat to protect the waterproof backing . do not dry by itself . 
i find it to be slightly warmer than without it , but less than some other mattress protectors . it 's really not too bad and it 's very comfortable . 
the bottom is waterproof , the top is a soft , almost velour top , but i ca n't recall what the sides are like and unfortunately i 'm not home to check it for you ! i do n't *think* the sides are waterproof , however ... 
no , it is not thick . just plush . if it helps . i was looking for something without padding it all , because i have 12 '' mattress with padding on top . i was looking for something i can wash periodically , sits well on a mattress without moving around , and works nicely in hot climates ( i live on maui , hi ) . all of these qualities i found in this cover . so , no padding . i hope it helps . 
the waterproof backing on these mattress protectors are 100 % polyurethane , which is the industry standard for waterproof protectors . they are made by an american textile factory in china . 
you should order the same size as your mattress . for example , if your mattress is a queen size ( 60 inches by 80 inches ) , then order the queen size mattress protector . 
if your mattress is full size ( 53 inches by 74 inches ) and less than 21 inches thick , then the full size mattress protector should fit . 
yes we can do that . so you are telling me that the hose has no pigtail to plug into the wall . 
it has a pigtail power chord that plugs into a wall outlet to power the motorized vac head 
yes , the switch toggles right and left to either turn on the head or not . 
if you wall valve opening is 1.5 '' , then this hose will work . 
no , you will need one that is called a direct connect . it 's the same , except that the hose does n't have that pig tail you see in the picture . 
not sure why , mine turns fine . did you turn your nossle itself slightly to make sure it has a good connection in the wall and turn the on off button on the handle to on ? ? 
the answer is neither . this hose connects to an air driven power head , vice an electric driven head , so there is no 110 volt connection . the only electrical connection in this hose is a low voltage fitting in the wall connector to start the central vac unit . hope this helps ... 
it does have an on off switch , but the connectors do n't fit my vacuflo wall outlet , so the on off switches cancel that out . the hose does fit the outlet enough to be turned on to use manually.as i recall , the write up on the product said it worked with vacuflo . only to the point of partially fitting the hole . does work fine , has the cover , and i think if is longer then my vacuflo hoses , but does not fit the outlet perfectly , on off switch does not work . 
this one does not but they do have one that does for a little bit more . 
yes ... and no . the hose power on off switch does not work , as the electrical connections in the vacuflo wall outlet do not match the cen-tec connection . however , in use , i was pleasantly surprised to find this was not an issue . on the upside , the hose itself stays securely in the outlet , is lightweight , very kink-resistant and quite reasonably priced . i would n't hesitate to repeat the purchase . 
do n't know if it 's compatible with the vsp2s . it does have a on off switch . 
yes we do . 
it has a button lock . 
yes 
i never had a hose with a switch before and my house is 28 years old and the hose switch works great . i don'y know what the warranty is but it is very well made . i am actually thinking of buying another one for the other side of the house . it is so convenient that i actually use much more than i used any of my other hoses . it is lighter , more flexible , does n't kink or catch on door frames . it is a pleasure to use and a pleasure to put away . 
no it wo n't . it is a low voltage system and you will need an 120 volt . 
you do n't have to worry about the shelf being removable . my table came with no shelf . at first i thought it was missing , but there is no mention of a shelf in the instructions either . but the missing shelf is the least of any worries you should have . i can honestly say that this is the most pathetic piece of particle board garbage that i have ever had the misfortune of buying . many holes did n't line up . globs of dried glue on the finished surface ( corners ) , missing hardware , and some small cracks in wood pieces . the instructions were pretty good though . took over 2 hours to put together . too much trouble to take apart and try to piece back in the box to return . a total waste of a hundred bucks . : - ( 
yes 
yes 
i did n't measure it myself , just copy pasted the dimensions from listing : product dimensions : 23.7 x 11.8 x 23.4 inches ; 40 pounds 
back is finished 
i would say it is very dark cherry . but it 's not black though , you can still see the wood grain and a tinge of cherry . 
no way unless you modify the metal . 
the largest hole is 3 inches with two 1 3 4 holes , two 1 1 4 holes and two 1 inch holes . 
i measure 9 1 4 '' across 
hi jessica . this is a great idea but , unfortunately , the cabinet doors do not have to be very thick for the door not to close . i think ours are about three-quarters to an inch wide . my daughter still uses it but it makes me crazy that the door does n't close . 
the actual inside of the largest ring is 2 7 8 inches . xxoo 
it drops down about 9 inches and sticks out about 6 inches . 
i think the 14 is the total amount of pieces including lids . as far as the sa , i do n't really know , maybe just part number or merchandise number or something like that . i do n't think it really says anything about the cookware . 
yes you can ! work great , heat up fast ! 
1qt. , 2 qt. , 3 qt . 
according to sam 's club they are manufactured in china . 
i do n't know , i do n't have a induction stove . but i like the pans a lot . 
i have been trying to find out - but unsuccessful so far ; i would not buy anything less than 18 10 . 
recommended is 150 lbs for the top bunk and 200 lbs for the bottom . bunky boards can be added to increase the weight limit . adding extra slats can increase the weight as well . 
yes you can ! 
they look identical at first . and they have same hight from the floor and the same length . however , after measuring we found out that the lower bed has a bit ( 3-4 inches ) shorter legs and bit longer upper part than the bed which is up . thus , the producer enhanced space between beds for the convenience of the person who sleeps down . 
bunk bed is all good and look great , i like it . the only problem before the top rail have a damage . the company they sent the part in few days . the customer device are great . 
i measured 29 1 8 inches . 
the paint covers up the grain . i assume it 's a hardwood of some kind . it seems very solid and does not indent easily like pine . 
yes , the ladder is removable . 
the ladder is on the right side only . 
yes , it is very solid and safe . 
no 
it 's cold . pretty neat system . my wife uses almost everyday 
hi there , the tank holds 500 ml of water-that 150 must have been a typo in the description . i can get at least 10 hours of the unit working on the highest level . i would definitely get this model , because cleaning is also a breeze ! hope this helps . 
i just use a cup to fill it up to the 500ml . i would guess it holds close to 2cps , but it will last the entire night . 
you can set it to continually rotate through differen colors , stop on one color or just turn off the light entirely . 
yes , i use grapefruit essence oil and another essence oil to this diffuser . 
hi , clean water is also fine . 
i bought this item with the purpose of using it as both a humidifier and an essential oil diffuser . i think that this unit works amazingly as an oil diffuser . ( it also lets out a good bit of mist as a humidifier , just not quite as much as a humio unit would ) . overall , i am very happy with the purchase ! 
you do have to push a button . that being said , the reason i bought this one was that it stays on longer than any other diffuser i researched . it also does much better and lasts much longer than mt doterra barnd diffuser . i highly recommend it . 
there is nothing to show that it is ionized , it uses ultrasonic waves to instantly vaporize water and the essential oils in the tank and produces a cool , dry fragrant mist . 
hit the button a few times , it is on a timer . i have this one at my lake house with no issues . perhaps contact seller . 
about as good as any we 've owned . 
the crumb tray is removable . the toaster has a limited one year warranty and is 800 watts . i have never owned a hamilton beach product that i have been disappointed in and that is why i bought this toaster ... ..extremely pleased with this product.. 
this is primarily what i use mine for ( i 'm not ashamed to admit it ) . the only downside is that with the wider slots , the poptarts get a little bowed in the middle the longer they are toasted . obviously , this does n't affect the taste at all . : ) 
the slots are 5 3 8 '' long , just short of 5 1 2 '' . 
yes . 
lol . i have wondered the same thing . it thinks it 's a smoke detector or must warn the neighborhood the toast is ready . 
of course , it 's a toaster ! it has an added feature of being able to keep ones toast warm 
no , it is not unfortunately . the bottom of the toaster has brackets that you can manually wind the cord around , but the toaster wo n't always sit flat . i also have an oster toaster that has a retractable cord which i love . it costs about $ 5 more that the hamilton beach . 
i have found that what your saying is true . we have to toast things twice on the low setting . very frustrating . i bought mine awhile ago should have returned it . if you just reasently puchased it send it back . 
yes , it is very lightweight . 
yes , brews stronger though , so although it melts the ice somewhat the `` iced '' coffee tastes good and is cold . 
you can get 8oz at one time . the instructions for both the coffee and the tea options will tell you to fill a 16oz cup with ice and use 8oz of water in the machine ( and the machine will only take the 8oz of water in at a time . 
if you place the sugar on top of the ice , the hot coffee that comes out will dissolve the sugar . 
it plugs in 
the jar is made of glass completely . the lid from inside is made of plastic , but water does not contact that plastic lid because it is much more above the maximum water level . unless you concern is about the water steam . yes , you need to open lid for pouring water in and it is not difficult at all . 
1500 watt 
the `` filter '' is just a simple mesh filter that is attached to the lid that matches the geometry of the spout . the mesh is about the same density as a french press filter , it is only going to be good for filtering out larger particles from your water ... but if you are using water that has crap in it ... uhh.. you may have other issues : p 
hello , i have never had this problem . i have seen micro bubbles just before the water starts to boil and against the blue led light hue could be mistaken for what you are seeing only a guess . regards 
no there is not from what i can see and feel , it appears that the glass has a lip in the bottom that is mated to the lip of the metal base . i can tell you we use it every day and love it . we have an 1100 watt microwave and this kettle can heat the same amount of water in the same or faster time than the microwave can . regards 
if you do n't close lid completely , water will boil until fire protection shut kettle off . 
water does touch the stainless steel bottom ; however , it does not give the water a `` metal taste . '' i love the kettle and highly recommend it . 
well.. the `` filter '' is nothing more then a framed piece of nylon mesh like a reuseable coffee filter . it only covers the spout so if ( for some odd reason ) you have a bunch of floating crud in your water it will not pour into your glass . it does look like you could pop it out if you really wanted to remove it , but just in case i snap a mounting post on it i did not try . 
it 's 2 prong 
hi michael , i answered too quickly ... sorry . the bottom is a metal heating element . 
magnets will not stick to it . it 's aluminum . 
the skillet measures 9.5 inchs . we have owned and used this skillet for at several months and it continues to look like new . we have closely followed the directions for use . m. sams 
i have never tried to use it in my oven . but i am still using almost daily on top of the stove . been one of the best small skillets i have owned . 
no 
no lid come with it and i have never seen any lid sold separately either . however , any other lid for similar size pan or pot fits , so i use a lid from other pan if needed and works perfect . why you want to clatter your kitchen cabinet with more lid ? ? ? 
i use my all the time on my ceramic top stove . i love my pan .

thank you for your interest in our product . a standard twin size bunkie board will be just fine , regular twin size is 39'w x 75'l . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
no . it is pressed wood particles . 
thank you for your interest in our product . the product that you are inquire for has a weight capacity around ~ 150 pounds . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
thank you for your interest in our product . this bed frame is made of 100 % asian hard wood . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
according to the walmart site , this crock holds 1.3 gallon , about 5 liters . 
no , it does not have a moat for holding water to seal the lid . the inside rim slopes down to the opening . that 's less than ideal for some uses , but better for others . i 'll use mine to ferment korean-style soy sauce over 1-2 years . in that setting , it would not be desirable to have a water seal , because bugs and bacteria would accumulate in the moat , and would drip into the pot each time i lift the lid to sample the fermentation . so for this application , the dry lid will be better , and i 'll cover the top of the closed pot with a cheesecloth and tie it snugly around the rim with twine . 
no , it 's not . the inner rim slopes down towards the opening . 
no . the inner rim of the pot slopes down towards the opening . 
i do n't have the sheets as they were a present for the grand girl . she put the sheets on her bed - a single bed - and they were a good fit . 
we have a standard mattress and they fit great . not sure if they would fit a thicker one . 
no . darth vader is on the other side . 
i gave this as a gift , i am not sure 280-300 
it fits a regular size twin but still roomy . 
i think it will shred it but not make long strips . 
yes it works on sweet potatoes . it is basically a very sharp grater . 
pretty much just shreds ... makes great veggie noodles ! 
yes , i use it for carrots , cucumber , zuchinni -- just about all vegetables . it woorks great . i am very pleased with its performance . 
yes , the slicer is orange as pictured . easy to use , easy to clean . 
hi colleen , the instructions and recipes are meant to be automatically mailed to you , i 've sent them to you manually via email and will follow up with amazon to see what 's happened . thanks for querying before leaving a review ! sherry 
no . 
it is a strip slicer so cuts things into julienne strips , so with an onion it will act more like a grater than a slicer . i use it to grate zucchini and onions for my quinoa turkey meatballs recipe . and to julienne vegetables like carrots , zucchini , beets , cucumber , for salads etc 
hello michelle ! unfortunately , we only carry bedding in a twin xl . 
i bought it as a gift so i can not tell you . i am sorry 
hello , thank you for your question . the twin xl does come in a few colors . here are direct links to the listings for the other colors : http : www.amazon.com me-sooo-comfy-blanket-twin dp b00f2rbx6g ref=pd_sbs_hg_2 http : www.amazon.com me-sooo-comfy-blanket-twin dp b00cxxv8ty ref=pd_sbs_hg_1 http : www.amazon.com me-sooo-comfy-blanket-twin dp b00f2rb37k ref=pd_sbs_hg_5 http : www.amazon.com me-sooo-comfy-blanket-twin dp b00f2rbjuq ref=pd_sbs_hg_14 unfortunately i do n't have any information with return to cleaning instructions . i hope this helps ! 
no you do n't . you twist the lid a bit and it opens to reveal an opening in which the liquid can pour from . hope this helps . we use ours for water as well..it works great . 
including the handle at the top , it 's 12.5 inches tall . it 's a great pitcher , but it is tall . 
yep ! the label says it 's good for both hot and cold drinks . 
no this pitcher is not glass . this is the description on the website : 2 quart capacity ( 8 glasses ) make , serve and store all in one . airtight , twist lid locks in freshness and flavor stain , cloud and odor proof . durable , high temperature material with glass-like clarity leak-proof , can store on its side . interchangeable accessories available ( sold separately ) dishwasher safe , bpa free , made in usa 
the widest point would be the pitcher plus the handle , which is approximately 6 1 4 '' . 
i 've only seen the picture of the soylent pitcher and i agree it looks the same , but i 've never had one of the soylent pitchers in person so i ca n't say for sure . you could always try emailing soylent and asking . 
it 's safe for hot water . i pour fresh brewed tea in it regularly ! 
no it does not . i have seen that model at peets coffee here in california but do not know if it is on amazon . 
3 '' 
the lid does not have a strainer , but you can control how much pours out by how much you unscrew the lid . 
this pitcher pours very well . over a month of daily use and nothing has dribbled down the side yet ! 
it does n't have to be glass to make sun tea . just clear . so yes , it would work , 
you made me get out my tape measure . it appears that it is 12.5 '' including the lid . 
the pitcher is not made of glass but of , `` stain , cloud and odor proof , durable , high temperature material with glass-like clarity '' as stated in the description . it is some type of plastic . 
yes it is . i still hand wash though . 
it is easy to pour . the handle is covered with a nonslip silicone grip and that helps too . the pitcher is tall , so we have to keep it in the door section of the fridge . 
it is plastic . it is also patented shatterproof and bpa free 
12.5 '' of gloriously majestic pitcherness ... 
about 22.5 inches 
no , you ca n't , holes are pre-drilled and left side of desk has rounded edge while right side does n't . 
yes , but the back of the bookshelf part has black cardboard on top and the bottom cabinet part is open for cords to pass thru . 
i 'm not home to measure it but it 's appx 10 inches deep 
65 inches 
not really , you would need to remove shelf and add something for files to hang 
29+ inches high x 45 inches wide 
no it does n't ... 
yes , it 's 48 '' . it 's a very nice desk . 
it 's 30 '' to the top of the main desk surface . 
1 cup ( 8oz . ) 
the exterior dimensions are 5-7 16 '' tall and 2-3 4 '' diameter at the base . the clear body of the dispenser is plastic ( not glass ) . 
the spout has two settings : open and more open . the creamer should work if they are a drier powder . if not , it would mean a rinse now and then , i guess . 
i have not had a problem with ants . i would assume if you keep the little opening on the side closed you would not have a problem . 
it 's a quality product and would not break if dropped on the carpet . much better look and feel vs the regular one made by the supermarket brand . 
i do n't see why not ! 
i do n't think this would be a good idea ... may be hard to control the volume of the soap . also i do n't know how tight you can close the lid . this is designed for non-liquid sugar . if you use for soap , you may have to take a risk of leaking all over your hands or kitchen counter . would not recommend it . 
pretty sure the lid would be ... i 'm not sure about the spout ... in the closed position , when shaken upside down , not a grain of sugar sneaks out . i like this sugar dispenser . ( and the similar s & p shakers . ) 
it holds about a cup perhaps a little more . i love it . it 's so convenient ! 
it holds one cup . 
what median are you using ? i 've used fondant and chocolate and both have worked fine . with chocolate your not going to be able to bend them of course but with fondant , after you take it out of the mold you can fold it slightly and let it dry for a day so it will stay in that position . let it dry in something that will keep its shape like an open big book . 
lg- wing tip to wing tip -- 1 1 2 inches med - wing tip to wing tip-1 in sm- wing tip to wing tip- 1 2 inch lg body -- 3 4 in med body -1 2 in small body -- 1 32 in 
i 'm not sure but is silicone and it peels off of fondant so it might work . sorry wish i could be more help 
i have not tried it but you should be able to pour sugar in it 
we used ours for soap molds and it worked well . we have not tried any other additional uses for this mold . 
i have not used glue paste in molds so i ca n't help there but ... i take paper that my art students no longer want and recycle the paper by ripping it in pieces putting it in a blender with water and blending it to make paper pulp . we then put in in a mold and press out the water using a piece of screen . let it dry in the mold and pop out . now you have a paper piece that can be painted or collage into other art . 
it comes with a fine mesh screen type thing to strain it with . overall this machine is wonderful , unfortunately the warranty is n't valid if you purchase from amazon . purchase directly from the manufacturers website or an authorized retailer in person if you want the warranty . 
with the assumption that you are asking how easy it is to remove the final product from the magical butter 2 unit ... .. butter would be the only thing that you would want to remove before it cooled enough became solid again . oils and tinctures would obviously pour out of the unit at room temperature . butter on the other hand would begin to solidify as it cooled . you could either use a spatula to remove the butter from the unit if it has cooled to a semi-solid state , or you could simply begin the timed butter making process again in the machine for a brief period , until the unit heated the butter to a liquid state again ( approximately 5 minutes of run time ) . you could then just pour the liquid butter from the unit . ~outlaw~ 
they have recipes for cooking oils like that . it does not burn the oil or the herbs , making it very good for that . 
do n't trust variety corp. they intentionally leave this out of the description . call amazon and complain . 
thanks for your question . i 'm sorry to hear your magical butter 2 was n't in perfect condition when you received it . you can return it or request a replacement at our online returns center here : 
rated capacity : 2-5 cups rated voltage : 110v rated frequency : 60hz motor heating power : 250w 800w 
no odor at all . other than the lights and the grinding phase , you never know its there . 
hello , as this item is sold by an independent seller on amazon , the price is set by the seller themselves , and not by amazon.com . we are therefore unable to comment on the price of this item . thanks . 
2 oz of bud , decarb in oven @ 220 for about 1 2 hr or till the smell becomes a little `` dank '' and sprinkle 12 grams keif when decarb..put in butter maker ... 10 oz glycerine ( food grade ) about 2 oz + of water , hit tinicture button . run cycle twice with cool down inbetween . ( ie ... more potent..put in dark for 30 days and then redo the cooking in butter maker one more time ... then strain in cheese cloth and then a nylon stocking and then a potato ricer press..and voila ... very potent tincture..it works awesome and creates an awesome body high . also works great with olive oil for cooking ... canni oil for your morning eggs is highly recommended ... and this machine does it all ... best investment i made . word of advice ... stick to indica strains 
yes ! ! but buy direct from company..not on amazon ! warranty voided when bought on amazon ... the box even says that ! funny they left that off the image photo 
yes , there is a removable filter to take out and clean . the filter would remove from the right hand side of the front panel of the unit . 
i purchased model acq088gpx - 8000 btu whirlpool a c unit and it came with a use & care guide # 1545059- it is made in china by hisense and their c.s . number is 1-877-465-3566 -- -- a. cramer 
no , i do n't think so . they are touch settings . 
yes 
there was a recall on this item from the manufacture . it was starting fires . you hade to cut off the cord , to include the safety sticker and pry the serial number off the back of the unit and send it in with a self addressed envelope for a refund . i did all of this and have never heard anything back . no money , no refund , nothing , except a humidifier that causes fires . you might want to call the manufacture and check on the recall . 
there is a timer on the unit . make sure it has been turned off . if it is n't it will shut off before it reaches 50 ... . i know you said it runs longer and still does n't drop down to 50. make sure you read instructions and check all settings . i had this problem in the beginning ... i had to read the booklet again ... . hope this helps mine works great 
it does make some noise when running but is much quieter than previous units i have owned . i would estimate between 40 and 60 decibels when operating 
comes with a 1 year manufactures warranty . 
the a c requires a grounded electrical outlet within 4 ft ( 122 cm ) of where the power cord exits the air conditioner . 
the installation instructions do n't say you need a outside support but i would suggest one for safety . 
your answer depends on the children , when the bed is down it is as secure as any bed and the hardware is stable and secure . i would not suggest jumping up and down on as children have a tendency to do . i slept in a bunk bed as a child and my parents had strict rules . i 'm very happy with the one i built , follow the instructions and you should have no problems . 
the kit is only the hardware , you have to have wood to put it on for a frame box . 
it depends on how you build yours cabinet . i had a cabinet maker build a mission style oak cabinet that does n't look like a murphy bed at all . instead of looking face on at 5 8 inch plywood sides , we built a substantial frame so it looks like a large freestanding cabinet . mine is 65 inches wide all told , but it could be a few inches less if you follow the instructions that come with the bed . 
right now shipping to south america is about $ 150 by air which will take about 6-10 business days . 
i used oak plywood . you should be able to use any kind you want . 
i am in the process of installing it so we have yet to sleep in it . the murphy bed accommodates only an inner-spring mattress ( no box springs ) and no comfy pillow top . just a plain vanilla inner-spring mattress . so i do not anticipate that i would want to use it as my primary bed . however , if you are young and hardy and have no other choice then it could work . i expect it to be more comfortable than a futon bed and about as comfortable as a good convertible sofa bed . in fact , had i purchased a convertible sofa bed for the man-cave instead of a regular sofa , then i would not be assembling the murphy bed . 
if you make it according to instructions , with a maximum mattress depth of 12 inches , yes it does identify each piece , the materials you may make it from , and the dimensions . the piece of wood that supports the mattress must be plywood . 
the hardware is very sturdy and well made . the instructions , including the video , are excellent . 
o.k. , i just built this a couple of weeks ago and found it to work great . here is my dimensions . overall height is 80 '' , 16 '' deep , 60 '' wide , 78.75 '' from the wall to the end of the bed in the down position . -- - dave 
when folded down it is 7 '' , if you are talking about the distance between the floor and when it is closed it is 2 1 2 '' . 
hi bruce , you do need a table saw , it would be difficult without one , but it can be done . i bought 2 sheets of 1 4in . birch plywood , cabnet grade . 4 sheets of 3 4in . birch plywood . i also had to purchase solid birch which cost about $ 80 . you will also need some birch edging . i bought 3 25ft packs , and i used most of it . i think my total expense for the kit and the wood was about $ 1000 . 
i redo signed the whole bed to operate at a higher off the floor level . even with doing that the bed with a crown moulding trim was 93 '' . good luck with your project . 
my vertical queen size bed is 87-1 8 '' tall installed . that would leave you 2-7 8 '' to the ceiling if you were building the same bed . my suggestion is for you to call create-a-bed ( the manufacturer ) at 877-966-3852. they are very helpful . 
not at the moment , but we may offer them in spanish in the future . 
you can dl it from their website 
matt , not sure about the struts , but the dimensions would be different . i actually wanted to mount a glass mirror on the face of the bed for our work out room . i called the mfg and asked about adding a 70lb mirror , they suggested not to . we got the queen kit . came with very detailed instructions . our bed looks and works fantastic . this kit , 2 thumbs up in all aspects . brad 
yes 
not quite sure what you 're asking , but i will answer what i think . my wife did n't want me to put book cases on the sides . we have one of those ladder shelves on one side with `` stuff '' on it . the other side has a small chair . it looks great in the room and she 's very happy . 
the mattress i plan to use is also 14 '' . due to work constraints , i have not had a chance to start construction but i have studied the plans and dvd , along with the december '14 issue of family handyman ( it features a murphy bed made with one of these very kits ) and i believe all that may be needed is to add an inch of depth to the wall side of the cabinet . i plan to completely build the bed frame first , install the mattress to get accurate measurements , and then make necessary modifications to the cabinet depth . 
i would think that you can , but i would definitely call the supplier to make sure it will work . it 's made for a bed with a certain size and weight after all . i do think it 's a very good product .

no , a normal box spring works just fine . my mattress inflated in just 5-6 hours and i only noticed a faint chemical smell . me and my so slept on the mattress the first night it arrived and we have been loving it ever since . i highly suggest this mattress 
i find this matress does tend to be warmer in the summer . i use a very thin mattress pad to isolate the heat . 
i have not seen any indentations . it it still as `` tall '' and straight across the top as the day we bought it . 
marybeth , both my wife and i have found the mattress to be comfortable and supportive . sleeping on our old conventional mattress , she would often complain of waking up with numbness due to pressure on certain joints , with this mattress those symptoms have vanished . one caveat , we have only had our mattress for a couple of months , so while i can speak to its comfort , i can not speak to its durability . 
no it is n't removable 
seems to fit exact queen dimensions , 80x60 . no problem with sheets or bedframes . 
i went for the platform bed without a box spring and have zero complaints . 
i would say yes since it was rolled up when it was delivered 
it 's either 10 year or 20 year . go to dreamfoambedding.com to find out . 
the mattress is vacuum sealed nearly flat , rolled and boxed . here is a video that shows how it arrives : http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=-xv-nsxagng 
i suspect you could but whether you would want to spend $ 800 on a mattress and then not mount it on what it is meant to be mounted on is probably a more important consideration . these mattresses are designed to last longer than their older ones but i 'm sure the way they are cared for matters . 
no it does n't 
a california king mattress will be 72 '' wide x 84 '' long 
my wife tells me that regular fitted sheets are what she uses and they fit just fine . also , note : i phoned the manufacturer in arizona with some questions befoe my purchase . they were more than happy to answer any and all questions and spent about 30 minutes doiong so . i would suggest you do the same . i obtained their name from amazon 's site . larry 
i personally spoke with the manufacturer in arizona about what is needed for support for their memory foam mattress . nothing special is needed ! he suggested to me that i purchase any box spring that is well made , in other words wo n't squeak , and that would be adequate . in fact , if one wanted to , the mattress could be placed on a well constructed wood platform , or even on the floor itself . of course , the floor would make it difficult to get on and off the mattress but the support would be just fine . i purchased an inexpensive , queen size , arkansas mfg . box spring . it cost about $ 100.00 . it is giving all the support the mattress needs . if the box spring lasts only five years , wo n't bother me . . . .i 'll just purchase another for $ 100 or so . larry 
we bought the `` saferest premium hypoallergenic waterproof mattress protector - vinyl , pvc and phthalate free '' here on amazon . it is very nice , good quality and a great barrier . 
i think probably yes . the unit is very sturdy . i had a problem with the wheels and had to leave them off . 
the shelves are adjustable after assemble . they are not locked into place for good . i have and do adjust my shelves as i need to . i really love my unit . i bought two additional units so far myself . wonderful product . 
13 '' x 30 '' 
instructions are not included . pretty easy though . put the plastic bushings around the poles where you think you want them , starting with the bottom shelf . lightly grip each bushing and slowly pull up and down till you feel them click into place . once you have all four bushings set for a shelf , firmly push the shelf down onto them . 
sorry i do n't know as mine came without any directions or paperwork . 
30 '' w x 14 '' d x 63 '' h ( or 59 '' h without the wheels installed ) 
exactly what the amazon product drescription states . 
we`ll i really do`nt know for sure if you can paint it.my felt apart within . a month . 
no , but it can be painted ! 
yes we do , if you search bunk junk you will see all the items we have for sale . you can also go to a la mode jewelry storefront . thank you for your interest in our amazing camp products . 
it is 24 '' tall 113 4 '' wide 12 '' deep . 4 drawers over 10 '' wide 11.5 '' long and 5 '' deep . remember it is cardboard and can not hold heavy weight . good for undergarments or for light paper storage such as bills and recites . 
no 
hi wendy ! top=12x13 bottom=9.5x11 8 '' tall `` scoop '' =8.5x3.5 
to store them , yes . 
hello , thank you for your question . according to the manufacturer the dimensions are 13 x 12 x 8 inches . this information can also be found on the product detail page under the `` product description '' section . i hope this helps ! 
the bottom shelf is 15.75 '' deep , not 11 '' at all . 
it has to be leaned against the wall . we used it in our guest room and it is perfect for a few books , odds n ends and some towels . if you are using in an office for a ton of books i would look for something else . 
if i remember correctly , the instructions were more confusing than helpful . i built it by carefully looking at the picture . i assembled the top half first , which touches the wall . fix the smallest and next to smallest shelf so that the lip part is facing the back . then , assemble the bottom with the next three shelves in order of size ( biggest at bottom ) . attach the back foot . once both halves are assembled , place the bottom half against a wall and slip the top half unto the brackets . 
it is a very nice unit . it is white not off-white . it has a great deal of storage as well . it is worth the price . 
it 's made of wood . i really love it ! 
i have mine on a laminate wood floor and it 's fine . the center stabilizer was broken when i received it , so i just unscrewed it and replaced it with a block of wood the same size and it 's fine . great looking product ! 
12 1 2 inches 
i 'm really not sure how much , but mine is loaded up with books , ceramics , and even a vintage typewriter with no problems . 
hello . because the book case is slanted the part thats not flat may not matter . if it does n't work , amazon has a excellent return policy . good luck 
the shelf is just under 72 '' . 
the 50 mm measures as a tiny bit under 50 mm , so it should fit . 
it fits standard 55mm or the basic coffee holder basket in any manuel espresso maker . the 55mm is universal . i would buy a better quality one , though , this one tarnishes after the first wash and is not very heavy or balanced . you get what you pay for , right . i would recommend spending a little bit more if you are going to keep it a long while . i would also recommend seeing one in person before buying . this looks small , but it is really big in size . 
this is prinarlly used for compacting the coffee foe espresso.. fill the adapter w coffee , compact with the large dia.. keep doing again sfter some more coffee powder.. then compact with the smaller end so that the surface of coffee is below the compactor rim.. load the adpater in the coffee machine tight.. you will get a good espresso at the end.. good luck 
yes , its a true 55mm ... .i use it everyday ... .. 
i think it is . it 's washed daily and has n't tarnished or chipped . still looks like it did from day 1 . 
do n't know . i have a delonghi machine . the diameter is 49mm on end and 52mm the other side . 
not sure if its plated ... feels like tin . has n't tarnished at all 
not sure . it 's light , might be cast aluminum . it 's very shiny , solid and works great though , i love it . have n't put it through the washer , no need because it does n't get very messy , plus if it is aluminum , it might lose it 's shine . 
yes it did for me . 
it 's very thin . probably as thin as a fitted sheet . it slips off really easily too . i 'm constantly adjusting it and putting it back on my 8-year-olds bed . 
its just a waterproof topper . only protects mattress from any liquid stains and sleeps very cool with zero detection . 
i put mine in the dryer ( washed before putting on the bed ) and did n't have any problems with it . i made sure that it was on low heat and was only in there for about 25 minutes . it did n't need more time than that . 
so far i have had no issues with either the queen nor king mattress that i put them on . 
i know this is going to be an odd answer - but our lovely cat does n't like when dad is out of town , well her way of expressing her displeasure is by peeing on his side of the bed during the night . the few times she has done it we have had nothing soak thru to the mattress itself . 
yes it is made in china . but it is n't a pad , it is a waterproof protector . 
yes , we do offer a full size mattress protector , but we are temporarily out of stock . we expect to have more inventory next week . 
i dont think that it would work well over a fluffy mattress topper ... the pockets are not very deep and it would shift alot . hope this helps . : ) we just bought a new bed and the mattress is very thick , i am finding that this cover shifts alot and keeps coming up on the ends . 
yes it is exactly like a fitted sheet . 
it keeps your sheets nice and cool . even in the summer months my sheets are cool . now i need something for my pillow . my pillow always gets hot . 
i think it does help some . i get hot flashes also and this one is way better than the previous one i had . 
yes i believe it will . i have a sleep number mattress , with the 3 '' memory foam topper on top of that , and it fit fine . 
yes and it is very easy to put your bed 
i 'm not 100 % certain because i can not actually compare it on both mattresses , but my impression is it will not fit a waterbed mattress . 
hi , great question . according to the product title , this mattress protector should be available in queen size . however , it appears that the queen size is n't available at this time . in this case , i 'd suggest contacting the seller directly to ask if they have it in queen size . just click `` contact seller '' on the bottom right-hand side of your screen under further information on their storefront page 
i have not had an issue , but i bought it in the winter - in nh . i have not experienced it in the summer , yet . 
made in china , veronica . 
yes but it 's a thin plastic fabric like 
i have a cal king that is a waterbed insert mattress and it is pillow-padded on both sides which makes the mattress pretty thick . i also have a 2 inch memory foam pad on top of the mattress ... not exactly sure how this all of this is , but this mattress pad covers it all . the description says `` twin size ( 39 in x 75 in ) ; fitted sheet style ; accommodates mattresses 9 to 18 inches deep '' . i would give it a try if i were you . you can always send it back if it does n't fit your mattress . 
yes it will work . i have a 15 inch memory foam works wonderfully ... 
i have had this for over ten months ( through the hot summer months ) and have had no issues with heat over a memory foam mattress . i did n't get sweaty , so i ca n't answer for someone who has night sweats . 
i have washed and dried this cool shield mattress pad in the dryer numerous times and it still looks and feels like new . it holds up very well . 
absolutely not ; and the manufacture makes no such claim . 
i am not sure . i have had the cover on my bed for some time now and no longer have the bag it came in so i do not know . the product seems to be doing ok. it is durable but can not honestly say it is helping with my allergies . all i know is that it ca n't hurt . : ) 
no , they do not cool you down when you sleep . 
it 's like a fitted sheet . 
the cool shield waterproof mattress protector is a `` fitted sheet style '' . the sides are made of a mesh that stretches to fit around the sides of the mattress , so there are no straps or zippers . 
i have a memory foam mattress and for us it worked great . 
i 'm not sure about the pillow top . i do n't believe it matters though . i purchased the king size and it fits nicely . my temperpedic mattress is about 8 '' thick and there is plenty of room to go higher . there should be room to for the pillow top . i love mine ! do not put in dryer , you have to hang to dry . the rubber backing will start to peel if you put it in the dryer . 
it has definitely helped , but i still get hot at times . 
not sure . the top is almost terry cloth feeling i 'm sure the bottom is waterproof as my son wet the bed and it did not leak through 
i believe in china 
i recommended this for my daughter who is also potty training her little girl . they have deep pockets so it should fit over any mattress . i do not dry it in a hot dryer but on a lower setting.it does not make you hot at night . i highly recommend it . 
yes , all the way around 
no 
there is terry on top and a thin layer of some kind of super soft and flexible `` plastic-like '' material on the underside . the sides are a shiny , stretchy fabric . 
i bought queen size . the packaging does n't mention dimensions , but the amazon page for each size does . it 's the last feature mentioned in the list on each page . for queen size , it says dimensions are 60 '' x 80 '' . twin and twin xl are only 39 '' wide . twin is 75 '' long and twin xl is 80 '' long . my queen-size mattress 59 '' x 77 '' . the extra terry cloth just stretches over the sides of my mattress with no problem . the actual sides are a thin , stretchy , somewhat slippery fabric with elastic . it 's big enough to fit around my mattress my box spring . i did n't cover my box spring , so i have easily 6 '' of the thin , slippery side fabric pushed between my mattress and box spring on all sides . ( my mattress has a 1 '' memory foam topper . ) my cover stays put fine because of the weight of the mattress and its topper , the box spring below , and the non-slip property of the topper 's cover . depending on the height and weight of your mattress , you might have to find a way to fasten the extra fabric beneath the mattress so the cover stayed secure . only you can answer this part based on knowing your mattress . and maybe someone else will weigh in . i hope this helps . 
no it felt much hotter to me 
yes 
i bought the twin xl and it fit one side of my serta icomfort adjustable split king perfectly . 
i love mine.yes it 's quiet . 
it 's like a fitted sheet . 
dimensions are listed in the last bullet point on the page , right below the size selection options . the twin xl is 39 '' wide x 80 '' long . other sizes are as follows : twin : 39 '' x 75 '' twin xl : 39 '' x 80 '' full : 54 '' x 75 '' full xl : 54 '' x 80 '' queen : 60 '' x 80 '' king : 78 '' x 80 '' cal king : 72 '' x 84 '' 
yes ! that is the reason i bought this product . i am a very warm sleeper . other waterproof pads had me waking up in pools of my own sweat . this product is n't quite as cool as traditional non-waterproof pads , but it is better than any waterproof pad i tried previously . expect to only have 15-20 % of the sweat caused by most waterproof pads . 
i returned . 
this should be placed right under your fitted sheet ! 
it protects the mattress without generating any heat and it does not draw heat from your body the way other waterproof covers can . 
it acts as a mattress cover and i 'll be honest , i do n't like it . it slides all over and does n't stay tight against the mattress . 
my mattress that i bought this for is a memory foam , and it does not make me hot . so i would recommend it . 
this is a cover for your mattress so , no it does n't make noise . 
it does not cover the bottom of the mattress or have a zipper . it is n't a full cover . it has elastic in the corners that wraps around each corner . 
i have a memory foam mattress and it did n't work for me . i do n't need a wetness shield . i needed something to keep me cool . it did n't help . hope this helps 
i bought this as an allergen protector..it sits under a regular mattress pad and 2 '' memory foam mattress topper..only way to survive college life ! however , as a care-giver for a 94 yr old his seems to work fine . ..have n't tried just pouring water right on it though . have you thought of putting the mattress in a zip-on plastic cover and then using this one on top ? sure to stay dry that way ... 
yes , that 's what i have 
it has different size fittings on it to be able to fit different size mixers . 
yes it does . 
yes . it fits both models by just turning it around . there are different size clips on the back and the front . 
yes 
no . i would not recommend stacking them ... 
it 's a little over 5 inches tall 
very light . 
yes , they work perfectly in the microwave . they never come out hot to the touch ( we 've only microwaved them for 2minutes at most ) . we use them every day . great glass ! 
i never have attempted to put a cover on one . if it is to keep the beverage warm or cool longer , i do not believe it is necessary . the double walls with the vacuum between does a good job of maintaining the temperatures . i would be careful about taking the glasses in the car or other places since they do shatter when hit or dropped . 
borosilicate glass is the hardest glass available and lead free . pyrex products are made from borosilicate glass . ozeri glasses are from china . 
2.5 '' x 5 '' x 8 '' tall . the handle extends 1.25 '' , for a combined 6.25 '' wide . it 's a fairly small narrow pitcher . 
i would n't think so . i sent mine back because of the size . i was n't happy with the top either . 
on the bottom of the container is displayed `` 1.7l 67 oz 1.8 qt '' . i have been looking bpa or bis free containers to hold water out of my berkey filter . this was one on the only containers i could find . glass is too heavy , thus ... ... the search continues . 
i have three different lock & lock pitchers and all have measurements on the side opposite the handle . 
a normal sized drinking straw will fit . the opening does not look big enough for an over-sized straw . i used paper straws when i used them for a party . plastic straws should fit as well . 
metal . they were of excellent quality . i ended up buying 100+ to use at my wedding . 
wide mouth jar lids have a bigger diameter so no , i do n't think they will fit . these lids are designed for the regular tapered canning jars . measurements are available on various web sites that sell canning jars , like walmart and k-mart . 
it fit mine but was disappointed inthe lid as straw will not fit in middle hole 
yes , i think so . 
these lids are designed to fit any size jar as long as it is regular and not wide mouth . hope this helps ! 
smaller than boba , larger than taco bell . i found lots of straws online and they all seemed to be standard sized . whatever they sent me was just perfect ! they can also use standard grocery store straws . enjoy ! 
it is all in one , just a normal lid . so no other parts are needed . hope this helps . 
yes , that is the measurement . they fit on a surprising number of things . 
i would think that stainless steel straws can be used with the lids . depending on the size of the straws , you may have to put them through one of the `` petal '' sections rather than the middle circle . i used paper straws and fitting them into the middle was difficult but i think using them in the petals is better since that way the straws are slanted and easier to drink from . 
all parts of the pro chef nicer dicer plus food dicing and slicing system are completely dishwasher safe . i am reviewing our manufacturing ingredient specifics to confirm the bpa status of the various component parts of the pro chef nicer dicer and will update this response within the next day or two upon completion of my review . preliminariiy , however , my recollection is that the storage container and freshness-seal cover are bpa free , while the cutting blades are encased with an abs hardened plastic that may contain trace amounts of bisphenol a. i will update this reply shortly to confirm the bpa content status of the pro chef nicer dicer plus . thank you ! 
the pro chef nicer dicer plus is manufactured in china ( guangdong province ) using finely tempered 420-grade stainless steel imported from japan . our factory is certified , compliant with all international labor standards , and has specialized in manufacturing kitchenware , cooking tools , injection molded food slicers and dicers , ( in addition to more than 20 diversified product lines ) , for more than 20 years . the pro chef nicer dicer plus brand retained independent component and ingredient analysis from the french national laboratories . the fnl confirmed that all constituent assembly parts of the finished product exceeded international engineering academy standards in all categories . we hope this answers your question and , as stated in our response to a prior inquiry , we offer you a full 30-day unconditional money-back guarantee on the pro chef nicer dicer plus . we hope you will give it a try -- risk free ! 
hi silvia -- great question , in part , because the answer discloses the core uniqueness and the key factor that distinguishes the pro chef nicer dicer plus from all other nicer dicers on the market today . and the answer is : as of today , no . as we are fond of saying , `` if it 's not black and white , its just not right ! '' when the product development team at new world cuisine set out to re-design the nicer dicer , we had one simple objective : design the very best food dicer possible regardless of price , then make it affordable to serious folks who love cooking as much as we do and who appreciate the value their time that will be saved by using the dicer . we carefully studied more than one thousand customer reviews from folks all over the world who purchased a nicer dicer during the 2012 13 production cycle . we found that there were two clear issues driving the customer experience into negative territory . one was the flimsy plastic casing and the other centered on problems with the steel blades . the blades were not securely encased in the abs casing and oftentimes would break , rust , or become too loose to or dull to cut . after evaluating the customer experiences , we set about to design structural changes that would address both areas of concern while also improving its overall performance dramatically . the result is the product that we released last month under the brand pro chef nicer dicer plus . we used a maximum strength multi-polymer abs plastic casing to enshrine the highest grade 420 stainless steel blades ( rather than the 301 stainless used by genius and other smaller competing brands . ) . the result is nothing short of spectacular . in all respects , the pro chef brand of nicer dicer plus outperforms all other products hands down . it is stronger , sharper , and easier to use than any other device in its class . so , bringing the color question full circle . most nicer dicers from model year 2012 and 2013 are green and white , with some appearing late last year in burgundy red and purple ( genius products on e-bay and qvc ) . we wanted to make sure that the pro chef brand stood out not only in terms of quality and performance , but also in terms of its appearance . we also wanted there to be no doubt in our customers mind that our product , the pro chef brand , was uniquely the best one available . we made it black and white , and that way , you know it 's right ! we offer an unmatched , best of market guarantee as well . so give us a try , risk free ! if , for any reason , you are not completely satisfied , let us know within 30 days and we will gladly refund your purchase price ! thanks , rich mathias , for new world cuisine . 
you can make two sizes of cubes - about 1 4 inch and about 1 2 inch . it works really well if you do n't overload it . 
the mandolin style slicer provides a one-size slicing solution and it is quite thin . if you push a little harder on the slicing platform , you will achieve a slightly thicker slice , but not appreciably thicker . so it is best considered a one-size mandolin slicer . - rich mathias 
i 'm not quite sure what vg rating you are referring to in your question . what i do know is that our 420 stainless steel sources from japan and that the quality and grade rating was confirmed independently by the jiangsu puv product services laboratory , shenzen branch . i will check into the `` vg '' rating issue and update this answer if necessary . thanks , rich mathias , for new world cuisine . 
the warranty and return policy for this pro chef nicer dicer plus include not only the complete amazon a-z guaranty , but we go a big step further . we are so convinced that you will love this product , that we are extending a 30-day return warranty -- if , for any reason , you are not happy with this product , you may return it to us for a complete refund of your purchase price within 30-days of your date of purchase . try this amazing dicer risk free -- you will love it or i will take it back . rich mathias . 
yes . all of the cutting pieces , the bonus peeler , and the bonus free stainless steel grater , all fit inside the container , which also includes the sealing lid for storage of your remaining diced or sliced foods in the fridge . 
quality is by far better ! blades sharper , hi impact plastic . well worth the money , in my opinion ! 
i would not suggest that . you could crack the plastic or even distort the cutting blades . my guess is that the blades are tempered . 
the outside of this toaster remains quite cool while in use . this is a very good toaster that gets heavy use in my household . 
no , it is a 2-prong . 
1800 watts 
the cord is 32 inches long , not retractable . 
hi . it may but the full width is 5 1 4 and the thickness is 1 1 4. so far it 's been a really good toaster , just make sure ( as with any appliance ) to check your timing settings to make sure you get the results you want . best regards . rick 
it is metal mounted in plastic . the black you see is plastic . 
yes rosie..i 'm happy with the toaster . i have had many toasters over the years and so far , this one seems to do a good job . 
i tested the bottoms by applying a magnet and the magnet stuck , so it has iron in it . i did this test to make sure they would work with an induction stovetop , as i am buying an induction stove . these pots are the best i 've ever had . foods do not stick , even when cooking without oil . 
yes . i bought it to use with the nuwave magnetic induction systems . works great with them . good luck . cracks me up that amazon ca n't get the spelling right . i have told them twice before ... lol it 's stonedine not stoneline . 
i am not sure , but it makes the best fried potatoes and cabbage which was a recipe from my grandmother who was from germany . 
it is 7 and 3 4 inches across the bottom 
yes , ,it is a frying pan , ,can be used on any type of stove 
yes . it can i have utilized it up to 400 degrees 
no 
it does not have a steam vent in the glass lid . 
i love it 
the coating . 
the mats arrive rolled on a cardboard tube and quickly lay flat after you put them down on the floor . 
the mat ships rolled up . it takes only a few minutes for it to regain its shape . i would say the box was about 3x3x22 . hope that helps ! 
not at all . there is a cat in the household with extremely sharp nails and she has not damaged the mat . it holds it shape perfectly despite constant traffic and does not appear to stain . 
i would probably go with mocha for more contrast and if you ever change the colors of your kitchen , this color will always compliment well . 
it is a different design , but exactly the same color . i have both in my kitchen and they match just fine . 
i think that 's the brand name ... ..all i know is it 's the best mat i 've ever found . i have 4 of them ! 
i suppose so , but it really shines for standing and making small steps like you do in front of a sink or a washing machine . 
i did not notice a smell in any of the mats i purchased ( four total ) . 
it 's about 5 8 '' thick . very well cushioned and comfortable for standing at sink or range . 
mocha , its blends in with most kitchen flooring and looks great . no , it does not show dirt . 
it does not come with a straw . i bought glass straws . 
i have two and have not had that problem , but was wondering if there 's a way to get replacements . mine smells like coffee , which is fine when i am drinking coffee , but not so great with water . 
it 's for the large mouth . 
i have stainless straws and they fit . they are thinner than traditional straws , but the hole would be big enough to fit as big as traditional plastic straws . smoothie type straws would be too big . hope this helps ! 
this is sold as a `` one pack '' , one per package . 
theres two different sizes . i bought both they work great . 
usa all the way . the design was originated in cambridge massachusetts i believe 
no it doesnt . i just used the widemouth ball jar band . it 's worked perfectly 
http : www.amazon.com gp product b00ajg5e1u ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 i also ordered the smoothie straws and they are fine ... 
no , not at all . 
the top of this pan is 10.5 '' 
dear chen , thank you for your inquiry . the weight capacity is 2 to 2.5 lbs . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
dear amna ali , thank you for your inquiry . the farberware 10.5 '' stir fry will hold approximately 2 - 2.5 quarts . we hope you find this information helpful . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
1 1 4 '' inside height , 1 3 8 '' outside height 
i 've never actually put mine through a dishwasher as i do n't have a dishwasher , but it really holds up nicely no matter what i put it through . 
sorry , i do n't know the answer to this question . i gave the pan as a gift . the recipient has used it on gas , electric & ceramic but do n't know about induction . 
i did not do specific testing but in use i found the air clean & the dust down . i can not leave it on when i sleep as it stimulates me too much so with all of this i believe it works well in the 25'0 '' * 40'0 '' room we use it in ! 
it comes with a detector . it really works . i like it , you can feel the effect by putting your palm in front of it . it does look like a retro spy cam so if you have guests they will comment on that : ) 
it has a range of at least ten feet , so take it from there . do n't aim it at computer equipment , especially a wireless router . mine accidentally got aimed at my router from about 8 feet distance , and my router started resetting itself over and over because of static buildup on the antennae . no permanent damage but very puzzling until i noticed i was getting a little zap when i touched the router , and then noticed the ionizer had been moved a bit . ( cats ) 
negative ions do n't have a very long life span , they come out looking for something to attach to . there really is n't a facilitating room size . you can maximize your results by putting it high up giving them more space to fall through , i have my on top of a box on top of a wardrobe so they have plenty of room to fall . its also suggested if you are using it for sleep you have it about 3 ' from you . negative ions do n't bounce , if they do travel to a wall or window they can leave the legendary black spot , essentially they take anything they have attached to and stick to positively charged surface . however this unit does n't have a fan so they do n't blow across the room and make a black spot . the cord is a good 8 ' . is roughly 4 '' x 6 '' and 2 '' high . it has a `` tester '' but it only tests that its working . there is no on off , if it is plugged in its on . 
that is the ion detector . it 's a seperate little device you hold up to the projector to see that it 's working . as ions pass through the loop it lights up a little led . it 's good because it dos n't really make a noise and it has to be pitch black to see the little plasma at the tip of the projector . this projector works well . 
i do not know if it is replaceable , but they do have a guarantee . mine works great ! 
place the ionizer as high as possible in the room with nothing in front of it so it can project out in front of it . i do not use it when i sleep as the energy it gives off seems to keep me awake . 
hello , if you are asking if a static charge will develop around the surface of an object if the ionizer is aimed at the object - the answer is that it depends . for example , if you stand directly in front of the ionizer ( within a couple feet away from the ionizer ) and you are wearing shoes then your body will develop a slight static charge . however , if you are barefoot , then the floor will drain the charge away before your body has a chance to develop a static charge . 
the negative ions will interfere with the electromagnetic field generated by those devices and its possible to short them out and that would n't be good for you . 
i used my phone in bed 6 feet away without a problem . 
i suspect it could . depending on the thickness of the material , i think this steamer could work just as well on curtains as it does on my suits . 
a little when you first start using it , but not bad enough to be a problem . 
works with voltage 110 and it works great . 
does not work well . is not strong 
yes 
you should return it . 
i could n't find any info that said it would work on 220v and there were no extra cords or places to plug them into on the machine so i would say no it will not work for your travels . great little steamer tho . 
i could n't get it to work either . i returned it 
this item works great on 110 , the 110 plug in is the only one that came with the steamer so i assume that it is not dual voltage . 
i 'm dissapointed . the steamer i bought can not work absoultly . steam can not come out . since it is not expensive and it is too trouble to return or exchange , i do n't want to pay attention to it anymore . 
it is light blue ( baby blue ) . i love mine ! 
no it does not 
it is plastic so needs no liner . 
nope . 
i 'm not sure if it 's pvc free . it 's a thick vinyl material . it 's made well and gives me something extra to smile at each day . 
it 's very lightly frosted which means it 's somewhat see thru 
no , just the curtain . 
price is for the quality . 
70 '' x72 '' 
no and they do not have numbers on them as well . wish i would have purchased wilton . 
on the package it does n't say where at all , so you may have to message the seller . they shipped from swizterland , so maybe there ? hope this helps a bit . i just received them a couple weeks ago and they 're are awesome . very satisfied with them . i read other reviews that the container would n't stay shut . i do n't have that problem or any problems for that matter . i highly recommend them . 
yes , it does . 
almost all the tips are in the 52 set and they are very strong , though not numbered like wilton or ateco . i never bought 55 set before and i do n't know those tips that are missing . thanks 
yes i use them without the plastic thing . 
most of the tips are n't numbered . only size 1,2,3,18,352 and 3 different star tips , tip for filling cupcakes basically all starter tips . im a beginner but tips for roses , curved tip for daffodils , shell borders , basketweave , fine tip for writing , 3 different leaf tips etc 
no there are no numbers inscribed on them 
there are actually 49 tips with the 2 flower nails and a coupler to hold the tip in your decorating bag . the flower nails are n't that long . maybe 4-5 '' i would say . this is worth buying . it did n't take long to arrive and i use them all the time . 
i 'm sorry i ca n't help . the set i got had no sizes on them . 
all parts are bpa free . 
i would n't put anything with a rind w o first peeling or scoping out the fruit . nor would i put anything with an extremely stringy texture . i have n't tried `` all '' fruits & veggies . 
cleaning is super easy . especially if you put a plastic bag in the pulp catcher in the back . that way , you do n't have to bother washing that part out . everything else pretty much rinses out with hot water , except the blade itself . you 'll need a cleaning brush to clean it off . 
it hardly can handle fruits . let alone seeds . there are many other brands available . 
i looked at mine and i do n't see anything like that . you may want to call the manufacturer . 
contact the manufacturer directly . 
3600 rpm on the professional series ( wal-mart sells this one for $ 120 ) and 3000 rpm on the entry level series ( the one they advertise on the infomercial that is not stainless steel but is still $ 120 through them . i purchased mine from wal-mart so mine is stainless , 3600 rpm . ) 
i do n't know it has n't arrived yet 
the book provides a cooking guide for meats , fish , vegetables as well as root vegetables , rice & pasta even eggs and fruit . it has a few recipes to get you started and comfortable - easy peasy just like regular traditional cooking i live this appliance 
mine is 11 inch square and to the top of the cover it is 9. fyi i also love it ! 
you may wipe out the main part of the machine . the trays and lids maybe put in the top shell of the dishwasher . 
the picture diagram on the interface is pretty self explanatory ; just press the corresponding button for the unit you want to use until you reach the preset column you want . once there you can adjust the preset time by using the arrows . you do n't have to use all the units , as they work independent of one another . you can use the trays for grains , sauces , etc and the elevated tray with holes for meats . so , for instance , you can make a meal by using the larger bowl and compartment for rice , fill one of the smaller compartments with vegetables , and the other small compartment with a marinated meat or eggs . or use the elevated tray for fish , one of the smaller compartments for sauce , and the other small one with quinoa . experiment ! 
yes.. it is ... . that 's why i bought it ... . 
i do n't know but i was particularly disappointed in this steamer - tried two , returned them both - and i do n't think i 'm overly picky . 
yes ! 
i just checked the label and it was made in china . this is one of the best purchases i 've made on amazon because this is a product i use almost daily . better yet - it works as advertised - both here and in the uk . 
yes 
i use my regular tap water , but i guess that would depend on , the quality of water where you live . 
i 'm not happy with this , honestly . when i try to put it into something small ( which is what i bought it for ) the little spongy pieces of which it is comprised break off . i do n't use it terribly often , and i get the sense that if i did , i 'd quickly have a wire at the center with only the slightest bit of sponge remnant on it . definitely not the best bottle brush i ever bought . 
yes , but be warned . you have to be careful with this brush . it looses pieces of material when you try to force it up and down . otherwise , it works fine and cleans up great afterward . 
i tried to put it in a plastic water bottle that would have about the same size opening and could n't make it happen . hope that helps ! 
i doubt it . 
yes , this brush will fit nicely into a 1.25 '' diameter opening . i use the brush primarily for a small container with a 1 '' diameter opening . this is a quality product and works fantastic for me . 
i believe it can . i use mine for large , hard plastic bottles . 
no , it is not ! i made the same assumption and found out , after it arrived , that it only came up in search because of the color : `` electric blue . '' god bless 
i bought it for a gift so am not sure ; however , i have not received any complaints . 
no , but it is super soft , and i did my research and amazon has the lowest price for a new dreamfoutain , i also found out with experince that when its cold the blanket will become warm , no joke ! ! ! so it doesnt have temperature settings , but it is very comfortable and afordable & # 128512 ; 
there is no cord . it does n't heat . just a simple throw , but beautiful and warm . 
48 '' x 60 '' ( 4 feet x 5 feet ) 
we 've been using this type of grinder for years . it does a great job , but i 'm not sure i could ever tell any difference between this and a burr grinder . 
i only grind a couple of scoops at a time , but it would probably grind about a half cup at a time 
john , i have never tried that , but it might work . it works very well with coffee . 
very easy - i use a soft bristles short handled paint brush ( get it at any art supply store ) 
very good for the price , but fast . pay . attention while grinding ! i 'm happy . 
we are very pleased with this coffee grinder . it is our second one . would recommend it to everyone 
i love the couch . there were some challenges putting it together , yet i built it myself . 
the picture you see will vary depending on your monitor . but the color is a rich , bright red . 
1. yes it is washable , but the manufacturer recommends steam cleaning over washing machine which will protect the fibers better . 2. yes , it is reversible . the chaise can be in any of the 3 positions on the sofa ; left , center or right . 
not really . it feels soft like corduroy , but it does n't have ridges . it makes the `` shadow `` like microfiber when you run your palm across it . my puppy slobbers on it and my neighbor drops his cigarette ash on it and it comes clean very easily with just a baby wipe . 
yes , it comes in 2 cover options . tomato and brown sugar are the fabric selections . 
the cushions arrive compressed in a bag with all the air removed and the instructions tell you to put on the covers immediately . i have n't had to clean the cushions but i imagine it may be a tight fit but not impossible . 
id say its taupe ... definitely more brown than gray , but a nice warm neutral . i have it in a room w pale gray and it works . 
this loveseat is manufactured in the usa .

yes , there are little indicators on the side of the pan to help measure out your rice . we make 2 cups each time but you can make 1 cup just the same . not sure the very minimum you can make but yes less than 3 cups can be done . we make jasmine rice with a little salt & butter in the mix and it is terrific . when we travel our little rice maker comes with , it 's been great ! 
yes 
yes we are in fl and used it last night again with jazzmine rice . love it 
the company is a japanese company . there are offices throughout asia and in california , but i believe california is just a sales office . 
the description and packaging states that these are made with non toxic distilled water , basically for safety.. however , that does n't mean that the plastic material is bpa free . i can not find anything on the actual packaging stating the the cube material is free of unsafe chemicals . but they brag that the water inside is non-toxic . 
i do n't think they would withstand the heat . i no longer have the packaging to see what it says on the label though . 
yes 
i 'm not sure . will have to look at the package to see if that info is on there . 
absolutely ! 
curious about your question i checked my two bags . i found only two that appeared to have `` lines '' in them but i could feel no crack or roughness on the surface other than the manufacturing ones . i 've had mine several months without any problems other than one created by my husband when he put tumbler with unrinsed cubes plus soft drink back into freezer ; those leaked when washed . 
i have not put them in the dishwasher , they are super easy to wash off and put back in the freezer though . i probably would n't recommend putting them in the dishwasher . 
not long ... an hour and a half . i love these things ! 
no it does n't . 
the case is sturdy , though it does n't stand as well as shown . the magnet closure is good , but not great . however , that said , it works well , the camera is not obstructed , the color is good and the construction very good . 
no 
i really dont know ... sorry 
i think you will need to find one for the rca 7 '' tablet , as the holes for power and camera would probably be different . this is a great case . we have not had any issues with it at all . good luck . 
you would have to check dimensions of both tablets to decide if it will work with samsung tablet 
i was wondering the same thing , and after some research , it appears that there is one vital difference between the livingbasix and glip : the glip only uses convectional heating ( rapid heated air ) , and has no infrared heating . the livingbasix uses dual heating methods , both convection and infrared to help cook things more thoroughly without drying it out . based on this , i would definitely go for the livingbasic . 
it works very well indeed with fresh food . you can roast- lamb , beef , chicken or grilled fish with herbs and spices just as you would cok conventionally . or you can prepare complete dish by cutting the meat into pieces , put vegies together and just turn on the heat and timer . you can practically cook anything you would using this air fryer . 
this is an oil free fryer . i would say 2 quarts of food , for example , 2 dozens of wings and or 4 cups of fries ; it depends on what you are frying . i have to say that the wings and the fries ( from scratch ) come out golden and crispy , just the way i like them . 
i 've only seen a demo of the phillips . i have living basix . they seem to do the same thing . we are very happy with our choice . mainly we use it for fries and it is great for that . 
it is not the weight so much as the bulk . the bottom of the screened basket is about 7 '' x 7 1 2 '' . so anything such as fish , steaks , etc . will have to fit within that space . of course the cooking time will vary depending on how thick the pieces are . the cooking times and temperatures vary and i noticed that the skimpy book that came with it and the times on the front of the cooker are not the same . i am very happy with mine ... but it does take a few uses to learn what works best . the one thing i do like is that the food is not moved around with a paddle which knocks off any coating that you use . also , i would not recommend this one for family sized meals as it is too small . for one or two , it is great and so easy to clean . 
i turn it up to 400 f and it takes about l7 mins . that of course depends on how full the basket is . i also stir them with a spatula half way through . yam fries are also great and some of the small potatoes quartered are wonderful as well . what i do is to put the potatoes into a plastic bag , drizzle olive oil and a bit a balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with spices before cooking . enjoy . 
no , its a fryer and the down part is empty , hollow , and the oil exude to external box as in a conventional fryer . 
you see , nothing non fried will ever taste as great as something fried , but things cooked in this device are pretty good . frozen fries are almost as good . what i like the most is that it 's simpler than frying , and after a while using the machine it even gets faster . 
you would need a robust step down transformer to convert 220v to 110-120v . read the specifications for the fryer , it may require around 1000w so your transformer must have at least that much if not 2-3x more . 
this is an oil free 'fryer ' so it 's basically a convection oven with a basket . 
the edible sheets have a shelf life of 12 months when kept in a sealed bag . so you can order yours today even if you do n't use it now . 
i do have a 10 x 16 cake topper 
just send me an email , with your order number and the name you want 
no 
application and storage instructions were included with the cake image . but honestly most bakeries already know how to handle the topper . 
yes , 
send us your order number , name and age of your child . thank you . 
i have purchased 2 in the last 4-months . i never heard of any copyright issues ... ... ... 
yes , the cord is a high temp cord that can go in an oven , bbq or smoker . 
when batteries are installed it will come on but not register a temp . gives you the desired temp for each possible meat . 
hey shawn , no the display is not back-lit . 
the probe cord is made of a plastic material , so i would not advise it . 
it 's approx . 11 1 4 '' l x 6 1 4 '' w x 4 '' h hope that helps

ordered on a sunday and it arrived by the end of 3 business days . 
i 'd say a little wider than a twin bed , with the exception of a shorter length ( head to toe ) . does that make sense ? also , it 's alright to sleep on , except that there is a bar in the middle that can be uncomfortable . when you first get it , it 's a little stiff , but after breaking it in , it 's decently comfortable to sit on . 
i have two cats and a dog . it does attract some hair but is easily removed with a damp washcloth or lint brush . 
it 's about a short twin size 
i am a 5'10 '' male , when i sit , my feet are capable of being flat on the ground , perfect level for having a laptop on your lap , or for reading . although sometimes i extend my feet when relaxing . 
it is more of a twin size . you can find the actual dimensions on one of the pictures located on the description page . 
not sure about that but when my sons sleeps on it a twin fitted sheet fits great 
some wood some plastic 
not really that cushiony but very sturdy . ok for someone under 100 pounds 
yes . the `` mattress '' is built into the frame -- the whole thing is an integrated unit . 
each one is around the size of a quarter , but much deeper . 
hi , yes , it does come out as kitty if we did it properly but is not easy to clean it thoroughly 
i thought it was great but it 's not completely 100 % identical . if you are very picky about details than you will notice that her head is just a little more like a circle than oval shaped . and there 's something about her eyes.. however , i do n't care and my family did n't either . close enough for us . 
no , it is not like sil pat . i have only used it for candy making 
unfortunately i 'm not finding that this membrane will work with your system .

i do n't know about etchingthe cup . i do know one of them cracked on the inner glass . i 'm just waiting for the other one to do the same . not a great item 
i have only put it in the microwave once and it seemed to work ok 
was too tall for my nespresso machine ... 
yes , it is bpa free -- it is glass , not polycarbonate . as stated in the description : borosilicate glass is both food and dishwasher safe 
not at all , no 
yes . i 've reheated my tea , often in the microwave , while using this double walled glass cup . 
it must be placed on some type of baking sheet , not directly on the oven shelf . 
i use them for the french macrons

turntable diameter is 16.5 inch 
see the answer above -- 10.5 inches . for your information , i have been shopping for large microwave ovens this evening since my 1984 sharp microwave failed today after 30 years of good service . it is 10.0 inches tall inside . i think i have seen one tonight that is 11 inches tall inside , but that 's the maximum . 
maximum height would be about 10-1 2 inches . sorry . 
no it does not seem to be loud when opening or closing the door it has a lot of room and is relatively quiet when operating hope this helps 
mine did not come with one . 
there is no selection to turn off the turntable , but you can remove the brown element that causes the plate to spin . 
the book says a minimum clearance of 3 inches is required between the oven and any adjacent walls , one side must be open leave a clearance of 12 inches above the oven

no it does not . you can have the sanitize function on or off and the filter rate is manually controlled up to level 5 
no i have not found that to be true 
i can not answer the cadr rating , but i can tell you that the filter is securely attached to the case and no air particles can bypass the filter . this thing is great and worth the cost . one of my family has rld with constant cases of bronchitis . all instances of this have stopped since we introduced the device in our home . 
hi mr ritchie just for this limited time the new clouds are in and the ( cloud ) does not have any ozone . but the summit that i am selling as a ( cloud can have ozone if you chose at anytime ) . the ozone plate comes with the ( summit ) does not come with the ( cloud ) but can be bought any time for 25.00 plus shipping.ozone plate produces ozone and is a purifier kills bactria in the air and on surfaces . any questions i have not answered call me lou lombardi toll free 800-868-5534 thanks . 
the cloud works ok with most odors . but when it comes to pet odors the only purifier that will work for pet odors would be the summit . the reason is that unit has ozone and ozone will break down the urine odor and penetrate in to carpet and soft materials . but if there is a lot of urine in the carpet and pad you will need to have the carpet steam cleaned to remove a lot of the urine . there will be some in the pad but the purifier put in the room with the worst odor will keep the odor from migrating in to other spaces . need more personal guidance call me lou lombardi toll free 800-868-5534 . 
yes this cloud air purifier has an ionizer that emits negative ions . that charges up the particulate in the air and stick to each other . they become weighted and falls to the ground and is vacuumed up with your normal cleaning . so to answer your question yes it will settle out the dust in your home or office . you will not see dust when the sun comes in and lights up the air in your home . now if you are also looking to remove wood burning odor the summit ozone air purifier would do the same as the cloud but with odor killing ozone . any other questions you can also call me lou lombardi toll free 800-868-5534 . 
dimensions : 14 inches long x 11 inches wide x 14 inches high weight : 22 pounds power 110 volts . hope i was of some help you can call toll free with more questions lou lombardi 800-868-5534 . 
hey mike there is a purifier for you ! but there is a good amount of maintenance with having a good air purifier for smoke . cigars are not as bad as cigarettes but nicotine makes a mess in all air purifiers . with that said you need a ozone air purifier ( summit ) not the cloud . the ozone will kill the odor of the cigars and the ionizer and charcoal , hepa , pco filters will also clean the air and remove smoke . but as i said you will need to wash the filters more often with cigars and the smoke . hope i was of some help you can call me for other questions toll free 800-868-5534 thanks lou . 
hi christie first i want you to know that the things you are asking for are for very large companies . the reason why only big companies do these tests is because the overall cost of the tests and ratings are not worth the investment for very small companies . so if you are looking for all that you need to spend 899.00 to 1,200.00 and up . you need to go for the iq air system . this is a simple ozone free hepa and ionization and also a pco filter system with uv light this is a low cost system that most people can afford . and it does work well i my self have had this type of air purifier for my kids for many years and improved my indoor air very well . want to talk call toll free 800-868 5534 thanks lou hope i helped . as for the clean air delivery rate we do n't have one . 
sorry about that i miss under stood the question . but as for the cfm of our machine i do n't have the answer for you . i have been selling this machine for 6 months with some of the best results in sale in many years but the company has never had the unit tested for cfm . but the company told me they will try and find out from the actual motor manufacturer who make the motor for the air purifier . but as you know it is not that important for cfm 's as it is for regular air flow in your home or office . there is no way a little fan in a air purifier could ever cover a whole house with air circulation . ionization and air flow is how this unit works . like when you burn toast in your home you can smell the burnt toast through your whole house . want to talk ? call me lou lombardi toll free over 40 years in the cleaning and restoration air purification business 800-868-5534. this is truly a fantastic product with a fantastic warranty . 
i kept in the refrigerator for 1 month . i wrapped it in saran wrap then placed it in a waterproof envelope . it was great and my grandson loved it 
2-5 business days and just reply to this email for the name . i also offer 2 priority mail 
on the amazon web site you would go to `` your orders '' then click on your order and there should be a link for contact seller . 
the best way that works for me is to place in freezer for 1 minute and handle carefully when removing backing but it should pop right off . since different types of frosting may be used by different sellers you may want to contact the seller you purchased from . 
i ordered it and it 's the same size as an 8x11 
the entire sheet goes on and be sure to only leave image in freezer for specified time bc i left mine in too long and it almost cracked . : ) 
9 x 13

send me an email with that information and yes you wil get cake topper before thursday 
yes , it is a hard envelope , via email send me the name you want on your cake topper . thank you 
i will send your order priority mail . 
i have noticed that it does go from blue to red ; however it eventually goes back to blue . i believe the sensor as it senses more pollutants in the air when it goes red . 
i clean the foam-like part of the filter monthly . most of the time i have it set on automatic and the fan speed adjusts based on air quality . we have 3 cats and 3 of these units in our 1068 sq . ft. home . 2 people with asthma and we are happy with how it works . the only thing that may be a negative feature is the light show , it will light up the room and colors change based on air quality . i cover the lights with electrical tape . 
yes . it has an on off switch on the back and touch screen on the front for levels .

good question about this air cleaner in december of 2013 so i 've had it for a couple months and it does n't seem to need a filter yet it has a display thatwill light up when the filter needs changing i have n't seen that light come on yet and i use it everyday at least 12 hours a day if not more . this air cleaners very responsive i would highly recommend you buy it . this is my first air cleaner and it works really well not only picking up dust but also removing smell on orders 
i have had myone for about 6mos now and run it 24 7 on auto mode . it sits next to the cat litter box . does a fantastic job . usually after the cat leaves the box the fan automatically adjusts up to a higher fan speed momentarily and when smells or dust are gone it adjusts back down . i have not noticed an adjustment in my electric bill . i think it draws no more than any othe small appliance.. so , no not expensive to run . 
by rebooting , do you mean reset the filter after you change it ? turn machine on , press `` filter '' icon ( of whichever filter you changed ) until it beeps 3 seconds . select filter icon of the one you changed till it 's lit up . press and hold 3 to 5 seconds . the filter is reset .

good morning , this does n't get rid of smells , just rids the air of mold spores and allergens . 
sorry , i really do n't know . 
there are couple of seller list under this listing . i can not guaranteed theirs but the jars we sell have special bpa free lids and you can use them for foods . they can also be waterbath for the jams . 
no . the opening in narrower than a tea light . 
yes 
they are small ... .about 1 1 2 `` x 1 1 2 `` . good size for homemade lip gloss ... . 
the lids should be turn 2 times . sometimes customers thought the jar closed after one time turn and after a while when the lids open what 's inside spilled . the best way to loose the lids are open and close the lids a few times until it does n't turn anymore ( jars has a stopper to stop lids to turn more ) . to use silicon pot holders or gloves to grab and turn the lid helps it . 
what size candle ? i personally would n't use it for candles . 
i have never had a problem with the seal . although you do n't have that little bump you have in other jars , this one is just a matter of trust . i tighten the lid really good . when i make jam and after i put the lid on , i just tighten the lid , turn the jar upside down ( inversion ) and set for 5 minutes . turn over and it is sealed . now remember the jam is hot and would seal as would a ball lid on a jelly jar . are you putting in a cold liquid or hot liquid ? cold may make a difference . 
as far asi know , yes . they would not be made in us if they were lead . 
i think so -- they are glass with metal lids . 
it 's 44.360ml per 1.5 us fl oz . 
according to sabeel ahmed , founder of chicochef , this product is made in china in an fda-approved facility . 
yes . the borders are silicone also . 
better ask mfg but i remember reading that you should not even fold them or fibers may break . i would n't count on it . maybe they make different sizes . 
mine came rolled up in a bag . i store them that way , too -- rolled without the bag . saves a ton of space and makes them easy to get out . 
i do n't change any temp settings using these mats for anything i do ! they work great . i want to use them with my induction cooktop but have n't gotten any answers from chico chef if that works 
i wash mine by hand . they clean up very easily and nicely without a dishwasher . not sure if they can be put in dishwasher . 
i have not had that experience with my mat . are you sure you had the right side down ? 
i 'm not sure what you problem might be . i have a convection oven and place my silicone mats on top of my double-layered cookie sheet . the only adjustment i 've had to make is to cook the cookies 3-4 min longer than normal . my daughter has a standard oven and has n't reported any problem with hers . i know that with my old oven i had to buy a thermometer for inside as the electrical power in our neighborhood fluctuated terribly ... sometimes 175 degrees hotter and sometimes almost that amount under ... 
since you can not cut the baking mats , i use them to keep food from sticking on baking stones and baking sheets , in which they will fit . a good replacement for parchment paper or greasing pans . have n't tried them with cakes , brownies or casserole since they do n't fit in those pans 
they are pretty thin , about the width of twenty pieces of computer paper . they are awesome and i definitely recommend them to anyone that does any cooking at all . well worth the price ! 
not sure of the exact type of wood , but definitely solid , not particle or plywood like . it is very sturdy . 
mine is espresso ... ..you 'll have to ask the company what they mean by cherry . thanks 
yes , they are even . i imagine you could do that . 
12 '' 
yes , i am 5'2 1 2 and i hit my head 
there are safety rails on all sides . you wo n't be disappointed with this bed for the price . 
you are fine . the weight limit is 200 pounds per bed but many customers stated much heavier adults sleep very comfortably . the bed is very sturdy . thanks for the question ! 
espresso ... like a very dark brown . 
i do n't know if they do or not . you 'll have to contact the company . i did n't need any when i put mine together 
no 
that 's about all we use it on - no scratches at all and works great . 
i believe the signature series has stronger suction than any of the previous vacuums . also , the signature comes with the regular bladed `` brush '' , while the xv-21 comes with the pet bristle brush . the signature pro comes with both brushes . you can also just buy the pet bristle brush separately with the signature vaccuum to make get the `` signature pro '' for less money . 
not sure what the official documentation says , but , the neato signature has a charging base station that plugs into a wall outlet . inside the base station is an ac to dc converter similar to what laptops use to charge their batteries . this provides all power . the converter in my base station is marked as input 100 - 240 vac , and output is 24 vdc @ 2 amps . in addition , the power cord can also be removed replaced to accommodate other plugs . 
one year . for details : http : www.neatorobotics.com warranty 
no it can not 
i have hardwood floors and it works fine but it 's very loud on hardwood floors so i just set it on a timer and it cleans while i 'm not home 
there would be nothing to stop it from smearing . the machine only diverts if blocked by a vertical object . 
i am pretty happy with the neato so far . i normally set neato to work when we are away from home . i have the neato to clean the first floor on monday , wendsday , and friday , and the second floor on tuesday , and thurday . the bad thing is that i have to relocate the neato everyday . one of my friend bought two of them so he does not need to relocate it . it is pretty loud just like normal vacuum works . 
i got the pet hair adapter because i have two long haired pets and i have long hair myself . i have hardwood floors with rugs and it does an amazing job . i 'm actually shocked at how much hair it gets up daily . i 'm not sure how it does with the original brushes . 
no , you 'll need to either order the kit ( like i learned the hard way ) or just buy the signature pro and it 's included with that model . so far we are very happy with this machine , it 's worked very well . 
tag reads : 100 % polyester , machine wash cold gentle cycle with like colors , do not bleach , line dry . 
you cant see thru it so i used a 10.00 clear plastic one there are so many colors to match 
the leaves are a very real sage color , the other medallions are more of a muted aqua . 
yes 
polyvinyl chloride 
there 's no red . the darker color that looks like red is a really dark pink color . 
no it does n't , some viewers said it does , but mine did not . and it 's not waterproof , so you will need a inside liner , i thought it was and mine mildewed a little on bottom . : ( it looks nice hanging though . i also bought the curved rod from amazon and it turned out nice ! 
yes : ) 
i think it would work - the shower curtain is sewn together with a cream colored lbacking adds more weight and helps the curtain hang nicely . hope this helps ? ! 
i think yellow and gold are forgotten colors , really . i could n't find yellow either and i ended up getting a pink , a blue and a white pillow ... they look good ! 
it has a lot of burgundy and a small amount of violet ( very light purple ) . 
no you dont ... the liner is attached to material . 
no 
no 
i bought the king size for our double ( full ) size bed . the top of our mattress is 24 '' from the floor and the king size was perfect ... no skirt needed . hope this helps ! 
it 's on a bed in my colorado vacation home so i ca n't measure it as i am currently in texas . this is the most beautiful teal dk turquoise color . the fabric is lovely , the quilted motif is lovely , i 've washed it once and it washed very nicely . i could n't be happier . and it is generous in size and covers the top mattress well . 
sort of they are abstract floral . got them on ebay the green in quilt is one of many in curtians including orange . it looks great

yes , it does work with wheatgrass . however , this machine makes the juicing process awkward and laborious as the suction cup feet continually loses gripping power , causing the machine to move around quite a bit . also , on a scale of 1-10 ( with 10 being the best and 1 being poor ) , i would rate the amount of juice extraction a 2 . 
yes it does . the larger cup with the green lid holds the juice . the green lid has small holes and acts like a strainer . the smaller cup shown by the handle is placed in front and holds the pulp . the white tip nozzle at the very front can be adjusted to control the pulp . hope this helps . 
nope . this is for very small amounts only . in my opinion you would be better off getting an electric juicer . 
no . made in china . 
if you 're asking can it juice carrots , the answer is y.e.s. ! ! ! ! 
yes it does a good job on kale . 
of course not . why would it ? once the insides of the fruit is cut open , you already start losing nutrients . you also lose the pulp that comes out the other end . 
hi edward , the nozzle unscrews the other way - turn it to right to loosen it . i know it 's counter-intuitive , but try wrapping a rubber band on it , and turn it to the right , and it should loosen . it 's odd that it should come assembled . hope this helps . 
the drill piece is metal i think . this wad my first juicer and i love it . it takes a little more work but you get a work out juicing 
yes i travel with it it only takes up a small corner of my suitcase 
there is some sort of error in the listing . when i pull up this model number in my account it comes up correctly for the stool which you could view at this link 
hello , i am sorry , i so not have a picture of the drawer open . the front face of the drawer folds down and the drawer pulls out . 
yes , the drawer front folds down for keyboard use . 
that is n't listed among the ones this is for , so i would guess not . but i do n't know for sure . 
it fits on ours & works very well 
yes 
i do n't know . it would n't work in my 530. had to ship back and get a refund . it was n't compatable 
there 's really no reason it should n't be . 
yes 
i have a 650 and it worked on mine better than the original ! 
i have model 572. i do not know if it will fit model 520 . 
i ca n't find any reference to a model 589. are you sure it 's not a 585 ? anyway , my roomba user manual is for the entire 500 series , so i am sure the battery is common across all 500 series models and the battery you are considering will fit yours . by the way , it 's been a great battery at 1 3 the cost of the roomba battery . 
i used the first one of these for 2 years and have just recently replaced it with another , it lasted as long as the original battery , with about the same run time 
they 're great ! the tip is n't flimsy at all . 
i looked everywhere on the tongs , but found nothing . where else , probably china . but , i will say it is my favorite ( i have 4 ) easy to hold , cool and a good length . 
do n't know where it was made , but it is very good quality . 
the interior space in 6.5 inches tall . the bottom of the storage area is 16.5 inches of the ground . the top of the table is 24.5 inches off the floor . overall i think almost everyone 's impression is that the tables are bigger than expected once seen out of the box . 
the inside is 22 inches in width , 7 inches in height . 
i recently purchased the same item . it arrived with a few dings and the veneered ends are starting to peel off . 
yoshihiro cutlery 's hammered damascus knives are very easy to take care of . hand washing and drying is recommended as well as using a good quality cutting board . honing on japanese whetstones is also recommended because honing steels can adversely effect the edge of a japanese knife . 
no i havent , i use mine 12 hrs a day , be sure to only use a wetstone to sharpen , and only use ceramic not a metal steele , never cut through bone , it should be fine 
it means there are 2 cutting edges . usually 50 50 meaning equal angle edges . this does n't really mean anything unless if you sharpen your own knife . 
it is 1.8125 '' ( 1 and 13 16th inches ) wide at its widest heel . 
oh my yes . 
this knife allows you to make surgical cuts in just about anything so i would think it would be ideal for sashimi , although i have not used it for that purpose . 
the wood portion of the handle is 4.25 '' . 
it is much more of an all purpose knife . it will work for sushi but you really need a longer blade for proper sushi or shashimi 
it comes with a hard papper box and it 's a really nice knife but you should get the nsw shitan for $ 209 way better 
i would contact yoshihiro and ask a sales rep ? i 'm not sure . 
this is a full tang blade , so it extends all the way to the end of the handle . the bolster seems to be a separate piece . i would ask yoshihiro to confirm , but this is what i see from my knife . 
i have n't let mine stay wet . i use it and then hand wash and dry it . high carbon steel does rust and the knife has layers of stainless steel and high carbon steel . i imagine that if you put it away wet it would rust . the core is high carbon steel . that 's what makes the edge . you would n't want the edge to rust . 
mine was oob @ 15 , but i took it down to 14 
i reduce the temperature and the cooking time , by about 25 % . you need to lower the temperature by about 50 degrees , i experiment with the time , using less time to start with , then add more time as i cook or bake . you will need to experiment a bit , then you will be fine the next time you cook that similar item . just take note of the temp difference and time . i have had tho oven for many years . 
yes it does 
hi . i 'm not really sure what used means on amazon . i 've never purchased anything from the site that was used . mine was new in the box . sorry ... . 
this is the second one of these i have owned . the first one lasted several years and the door hinge broke . decided to replace the entire oven rather than try to repair . have not used any other brand or any other krups . i love it . it is about the only oven i ever use ... .especially in the summer ... .large oven makes the house too hot . can make almost anything in the small convection oven that can be made in the large oven and it tastes just as good and much more cost effective . only use the large oven occasionally . 
34 '' 
one year warranty . 
for normal bread , you flip the grate around to centre it in the oven , there is a `` toast '' button and then up down buttons for length of time for toasting . i find that even with the grate centred , the toast browns slightly more on the top than the bottom . for buns , i leave the grate lower in the oven and toast that way as it centres the buns better . 
yes it is lit with a blue background for a few seconds after the oven finishes cooking , but other than that it is an unlit lcd ( black on gray ) 
it is about 20 1 2 '' wide ( with handles ) , 14 1 2 '' deep and 10 1 2 '' high . i love it . 
the msrp ( manufacturer 's suggested retail price ) for this oven is $ 299.00 . the map ( minimum advertised price ) is $ 199.99 . thank you 
yes they can carry at least that much . they are tall deep . i usually put boxes of cereal in them when i grocery shop and bag my own groceries . yes they have the two handles , one long and one short . 
no they do n't , sorry . i had also thought they would be a heavier weight plastic than what they are . 
absolutely ! ! ! ! ! i use one of my recently bought 2 ikea bags for just that reason . daily , i pick up trash and recycleable items on the highways near me . i come back with a full bag . i love my bags . i keep the other bag clean and just used it yesterday to carry towels to and from muir beach here in northern california . jane 
they measure about 17 3 4 x 7 x 17 3 4. i constantly use mine . my only problem is getting my kids to return them when they 've borrowed them . i need to order more . 
i was suprise too . but if you fold the edge , do it like a paper shopping bag , than its a vritical bag . but need check the stitching , if any thread is lose , a open hole there . 
17 3 4 '' tall , 17 3 4 '' wide , and 7 '' in depth just as stated in product description . i measured them after i received my first order and the measurements given are accurate . 
measurements given on product page are accurate once opened as in picture . they hold a lot and seem very sturdy . i have 4 of this size and family members own 6 or 7 of the larger bags that keep in cargo area to tote groceries in the house or whatever . recently used several of both sizes when i cleaned out linen and clothes closet for donations which saved on number of trips to car to load up . very versatile bags for anything you need to tote around . 
17 inches 
idk ... 
sorry - no idea . they seem very sturdy , but we have n't had anyone much over 200 lbs sit on them . hope this helps . 
i do n't recall what the packaging says , but i 've put mine in the dishwasher a number of times . they retained their shape and still work just fine . 
yes , it fits a straw nicely . i use stainless steel straws , but it would also accommodate a plastic straw . 
they probably wo n't fit . you could always cut the hole larger . the holes are similar to a standard to go hot drink lid . 
fits fine for me . it is a nice little box . 
approximately w3.5 '' x l3.5 '' x h2.75 '' 
approximately w3.5 '' x l3.5 '' x h2.75 '' 
dump it in the bottom of pot and fill with water then set the top on and push . great coffee and fun to make . 
i hav n't had that prob-i hand wash. top knob does unscrew so you can pull plunger out . maybe then shake water out ? 
to heat up water in ? you could but i do n't think it 'd work well , it 's double walled so no heat will be directly applied to it 's content . 
it is difficult to unscrew it but keep trying . i actually had to take a plyers and gently hold on to the post and hold onto the base with a towel so it does n't slip and then turn it . i found that after i got it unscrewed the first time it seems to come apart much easier now . good luck . 
this press is all metal construction . no plastic components . 
you should not ever need to replace the screen . french presses , such as this one , are made with a permenant screen . 
inside dimensions are 3 5 8 . *note-to be sure that coffee stays hot , i make a plug out of aluminum foil . 
since you use the press to make the coffee , you pour the coffee off after it has brewed for about four minutes . if you leave it in longer the resulting coffee is very strong . so , the press is n't really intended to store hot coffee . 
after allowing for coffee , it holds about 4 cups . 
all stainless-steel ( pot , plunger , screen , wire tensioner ) . no plastic bits . 
yes , i use mine all the time on my glass top stove with no problems . 
they work really well on mine and i have an induction cooktop . 
i had to research and this is what i found `` says dishwasher safe : no . do n't do that . enamel can etch over time in the strong detergent used in dishwashers . enamel can get an ashy surface as the glass substance can get etched with microscopic scratches and haze ( enamel is , basically , glass fused onto metal . ) '' 
is this still on sale ? 
it was on sale.. it is no longer 
it is around 6 cups . 7 '' across and 3 3 4 '' deep . its very nice you will love it . 
totally dishwasher safe , cleans up great also ! 
we use it for chocolate and it does fantastic ! and it 's easy to clean too ! my son just used it to teach a chocolate class and it all went a lot smoother with the silicone ! and with my small kitchen , it 's perfect ! 
laura , i would think so if you melt candle wax by putting this over a pot with hot water on the stove . it melts the candy coatings fine so i would think it would work for candle wax too . 
i would think so because it 's placed over boiling water so can withstand a great deal of heat , but not absolutely certain . i melted white `` almond bark '' and put in crushed peppermint sticks ... but did n't keep it on burner to melt the peppermint sticks and still it was hot enough many of the smaller bits melted . 
no 
yes , it is - i have only used it once so far , and it worked really great . i warmed up refried beans , and they turned out great ... ..usually i burn them . 
i 've used it with both my 3 qt . and 4 qt . saucepans but it does n't fit either really well but i think that 's because my saucepans flute out at the top . i usually use it with my 4 qt . more often and let steam escape out the other side while one side fits snugly . 
i think it holds 6 cups 
i 'm not sure . i 've used it to melt paraffin , and though it took a while since it 's indirect heat , and we had to break apart the paraffin into small pieces , it melted it just fine . we had the water at a very high boil so the steam would heat the bottom of the silicone unit . 
the lid is stainless , nice quality . i bought it for a de buyer 14 '' frying pan ( 2nd try ) . the lid did not fit without a little modification . i used a belt sander to remove a little from the rim at the location of each handle . it now fits perfectly . this is a large lid , make sure you have a place to store it when not in use . 
i measure it as 14.5 '' from edge to edge . 
dear s.b . cleary , thank you for your inquiry . this is a 14 inch lid so , so it should fit a 14 skillet . to get the proper fit of lid we suggest that you measure from rim to rim and round it to the nearest inch . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . sincerely , tonia d . 
dear shuling , thank you for your interest in the circulon product line . our products are made in our oversees factories , either thailand or china . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
lightweight stainless steel 
i 'm actually using it for a kitchen aid flat bottom wok ( which works great ) ! 
dear bonhollio , thank you for your inquiry . this lid measures 14 inches . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . sincerely , tonia d. consumer relations representative 
dear seema soni , thank you for your inquiry . the 14 inch wok lid weighs approximately 2 pounds . i hope you find this information helpful . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . regards , susie consumer relations 
hello amazon consumer , yes that item is stainless steel , however the gauge i do not have available . i have inquired and will be able to provide you with an answer within 24 to 48 hours . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . sincerely , audrey consumer relations 
i made egg muffins this morning and the recipe called for measuring the batter as one-third of a cup per muffin indentation ; that worked perfectly with this silicone pan . 
this muffin tray is not strong enough to be used without support . i use an old cookie tray underneath it when baking . i would recommend some kind of rack or tray . 
the one i just received says `` made in china '' . 
12.75 '' l x 9.75 '' w x 1.25 '' h 
dear aimee , the twist test actually shows the difference between the fda approved silicone material and the european standard lfgb , both are 100 % silicone products however silicone comes in different consistencies . this has nothing to do with silicone content . our products are 100 % silicone otherwise they would melt in the oven . thank you for the great question . 
hi big t ... yes its pba free and we use silicone that is lfgb certified which is higher then fda certified , its actually a european standard which for whatever reason is higher . please let us know if we can answer any other questions . 
this is in response to the fuffin cup size . they are 1 1 8 deep , 2 5 8 at the top and taper slightly down to 2 1 8 at the bottom , hope this helps ! 
the instructions say to spray it with a little oil , so i do . but they slide out so easily i 'm sure it would be fine without any oil , unless you 're making something with absolutely no fat in it at all , that might stick . 
the instructions said to season with vegetable oil before the first baking . i used pam and it came out fine . subsequent times i used nothing and they popped right out . but the oil content in the food might make a difference too . 
no , i did n't 
i just tested it and got 2 tbsp . of water in a cup , so it looks like they 're an ounce . 
not me . to the contrary , i believe this pan bakes more evenly and take a little less time than my old non-stick pan . 
it 's pretty floppy , so i have n't tried using it without putting a cookie sheet under it ( i use it all the time ) . you could probably do it without , but i just prefer the extra stability ! 
1 ounce for 24 cup muffin pans 
2 inches 
the lack of sufficient oil may cause this . 
no , its for the 12 cup muffin pan 
standard 
the depth of this muffin pan is 1 inch . 
when i tried to access the free recipe offer on line i was messaged that this offer had expired and would not be available ! 
i do n't think disposal straws will keep a tight seal . the reusables are in the lid fairly snug . i just your average pipe cleaner and dish soap and they get clean even after thick smoothies . 
yes , as long as the mouth of the jar is not a wide mouth . 
pint size jars 
the wide mouth lids will fit any wide mouth jar : pint , quart , or half gallon . 
the jars are glass , the lids are plastic . they work great and i use my jars all the time ... especially now that i have the lids with the straws in them and can access freshly made juices , etc away from home 
it does not leak out of the lid or the rubber grommet . its a water tight fit . the straw is hard to get in the grommet tho . you have to get it wet first and twist it while you push it in the lid . liquid will come out of the straw tho , but that part is expected . we love the lids . 
they can be used with pint or quart jars 
the hole size is normal straw size . i do n't see why it would not work . you would get a good seal and the cap is very durable . 
rebecca , these are just the lids ( jars are not included ) . yes you can use other straws with them 
it would depend on how the soap pump is anchored in . we have never tried this yet . 
you can always call the seller and ask that . 
how comfortable is it for an adult ? i weight 186 lbs 
hi sherrin ! a couple responses ( after using mine for about 6 months , and taking some measurements ) : ( 1 ) the recline is not adjustable ( only 2 positions - open or shut ) . ( 2 ) i do n't think it reclines as much as you think ( if you look closely at the photo , i think the placement of the hinge creates a minor optical illusion ) . i actually measured the recline - it 's about 20-21 degrees , whereas an average dining room chair back would be reclined 15 degrees , and the average living room furniture would be 15-20 degree recline . to me , it feels the same angle as any other living room furniture i 've ever used . ( 3 ) because the chair sits lower to the ground ( 12 or 13 '' , compared to an average dining room chair of 16 '' ) , your knees would be in your chest if you tried to `` prop up '' the back too much . yes i think you could back it up against a wall , just does n't seem like it would be comfortable . i 'm over 6 ft , i think this chair is super-comfy the way it is ( i 'm usually working on my laptop , but i also use it for watching tv & or gaming ) . my suggestion is , take your measurements , only get it if you think it will work for you as-is . 
the box says 225 pounds ( we 've had heavier people use them with no problem though ) 
we do not have memory foam , but yes , the gel pad does lose it 's coolness after a few hours . but it still provides hours of cool sleep ! i bought this for my husband and he loves it ! there have been a few nights where he wakes around 4am to remove it ( because it got warm ) . but he still loves it and recommended it to multiple people ! i hope this helps ! 
no . it was remained pliable for me for several months now . however , i have kept it folded in my bedroom at room temperature . 
i do not think so . i tried it on a regular spring coil mattress and it behaved like a gel eye mask . it stayed cool for approximately an hour and it was very pleasant during that time , but eventually it started accumulating heat and radiating it back . by the way , my condolences on owning a memory foam bed - those things are impossible to sleep on because of overheating . nothing beats regular mattress . i only tried this cooling pad because my bedroom gets hot during summer , but it turned out my bed actually felt cooler without cooling pads on it .

chair height total - 43 in width - 16 in seat height - 16 in 
i am not sure but maybe between 20-25 pounds 
i have carpet and they do not slide . i am sure they would slide easily on hardwood , if you put felt on the bottom of them . overall very nice chairs and have not had any issues with them . 
approx . 17.5 inches from floor to seat , 43.5 inches from floor to very top of the back of the chair . 
these chairs have a lot of bounce to them due to the way the metal legs make the u shape from the floor to under the chair . i 'm sure they would hold someone of that size but i do n't know for how long or how comfortable it would be for them . also , the width of the chair seat is about 16 inches max . i think this would prove to be very uncomfortable for the person . 
they came 4 in a box , so i guess you would have to contact the company . they are great chairs tho ... 
i really like these chairs . it 's a true white . the only thing is that they are too easy to get other colors . like me seating on this chair with a jeans , and it turned to blue . 
i feel that they are not all that sturdy im 145lbs my husband is 200lbs it hold him but he also feels like it isnt sturdy . 
about 43-3 4 '' . 
the color is definitely whites and not off-white . i will be honest , these chairs although they are sturdy , have quite a bit of bounce in them when you sit on them and making them feel cheap and unsturdy . i would not recommend them . 
these are very comfortable , and the height is the same as any other full-sized chairs . these , for the price , have a very nice lumbar support , and in my case , provide good upper back support as well especially at the shoulder level 
antique brass 
nothing seems to be 24.5 '' . the seat height is is 19 '' . the width of the seat is 20.5 '' . the seat from front to back is 19 '' . the back is 41 '' . 
definitely not expresso . i suppose it 's closer to heney . very similar to what is displayed on picture . 
persons that weight 180+ have sat on them with no problem 
yes you must attach the back to the seat bottom and attach each leg.very ez to do . just love these chairs . i did spray with scotch guard fabric protector too . 
i weigh 195lb and several of my friends weigh over 275lb . i do n't know what the mfgr suggests , but i feel safe enough to buy 2more . 
softer than burlap but impossible to put together . holes not drilled all the way , wabbly , screws do n't fit right . 
light beige 
yes . 
yes according to rubbermaid website they are bpa free . 
12 1 2 '' long by 4 3 4 '' wide , love these trays by the way ! 
i bought the one i have for the same reason and i was very disappointed with the outcome on both . the chicken was not cooked in the time it said it should take . i had to re-set the timer twice . i also tried french fries in it and they were not crispy at all just very dry . i am not impressed with the unit , it 's a great concept , but it failed to do what it promised . it was an expensive lesson , because the company i bought it from refused to let me return it , bacause they said it was used . how could i have known that it was not worth the money , unless i tried it . buy at your own risk . 
it is somewhat similar in that it also uses very hot circulating air to cook the food . the philips does not have a broiler element , but a heating element that heats up to 400* and this air circulates around the food to cook it all over . the food sits in a basket and has directional vents in the bottom to circulate the 'jet stream ' optimally . it needs just a bit of cooking spray to 'cook ' the outside and make it golden brown as if submerged in hot oil . to me , it looks like the halogen oven is better for big items like roasting chickens , smaller whole turkeys , etc . it does n't look like the convection heating can get 'under ' the food . the philips is great for fish sticks , french fries , fish portions , oysters , etc . i 've found you can even 'poach ' fish by putting a 1 2 inch of water in the bottom and the fryer thus poaches with very moist air rather than being submerged . similar technology , depends what kind of food you are preparing and for how many . the oiless fryer is good for a couple . 
hi . real life customer here . i had one of these in australia for about a year ( they seem more popular there and you can buy them at most appliance retailers ) . we loved it so much we hunted one down in the us when we moved there earlier this year . it does a brilliant job of giving you the taste and crispiness of fried food without any of the oil . it really works . it is good for frozen fries , chicken nuggets and other types of frozen oven bake style fried foods . heating in an oven gives a good result but this is much faster and is just like it has been freshly fried ... with zero oil . it is also brilliant at reheating takeout . no more yuk cold mcdonald 's fries when you get home with your burger . it is not a straight replacement for a deep fryer though . i sometimes use it to cook fried chicken , but i coat the chicken pieces in seasoning , then shallow fry in a frypan for 2-3 minutes each side just to get some oil into the pieces and then put in the air fryer for 10 minutes . they come out perfect . my mum skips the shallow fry step but just sprays some oil ( pam ) on them then air fries them . they come out pretty good but i find them a little dryer - not quite golden kfc style . i 've not tried baking with it , though i have done nachos in it which turned out well . also anything you want to cook in a batter will still need to be 'sealed ' by shallow frying it first before moving to the air fryer . to be honest , we mostly use it for frozen fried foods ( fries , chicken pieces ) because it is fast and gives a perfect result ... and it is worth it just for this ! 
probably , but i would not recommend it . bacon spatters grease which would hit the heating element and could start a fire 
absolutely . i 've made them . in less time than traditional deep-frying -- and with no oil . 
if you dip it in buttermilk and then the breadcrumbs or whatever , yes it will . as long as it 's not dripping . if its dripping , the fan may blow all the liquid off the meat . the basket is not that big , room for about 3 legs or two breasts . the cooking is done by super-heated , recirculating air . that 's why if you are doing fish sticks or chicken tenders , you need to spray a little cooking spray on the items so they have a little moisture and are not completely dried out . aso , i believe they just came out with a larger capacity model . you might check that so you can make more fried chicken pieces at one time . 
7 '' x7 '' x3 '' 
yes , it comes . 
its analog not digital so its not accurate set time more or less depending what you 're cooking meat better a min or so more 
120v , at least mine is . 
i put it in the refrigerator when i first got it and it got very cold . i have n't put it in the refrigerator since . it really stays cold for me but if you like it really cold and get really hot at night , you can just put it in the refrigerator again . i have never needed to put it in the freezer but you can . i works so good ! ! ! it is so much better than the chillow or any others on the market . i have tried them all ! this one is soft and comfortable unlike the others . 
it is pretty thin and not stiff at all so i do n't see why you could n't use it with a neck pillow . unlike , the tv advertised chillow which gets extremely hard after filling it with water and putting it in the refrigerator or freezer , this one is very soft and flexible . my son absolutely loves it . he will put it in the refrigerator once in awhile to make it really cold but it stays cool by itself for days and days . this is one of the best internet items i have bought in a long time . 
it has the texture and feel of surgical tape . it is a large flat gel ice pack . works great and keeps its cool . 
when i put it in the refrigerator or freezer , it got it too cold . i discovered that just leaving it on the headboard of the bed was enough for it to get cold . one does not last long enough so i bought a second one . now i leave them both hanging on the headboard to the bed and and they get cold enough for me . when i need to use one during the night , i just put it right on top of my pillow . it 's soft enough and it feels fine on my face . the coolness feels great . if i wake up in the night feeling too warm , i reach up and pull down the other one and i put this warm one back up on the headboard . 
it lasts through the night- cool for a few hours but never warm . 
i would put a pillow case over it just to be on the safe side . the pillow case would be really big but it would give the pad protection but i was say yes . 
i seriously doubt it . between the thickness of the pad and the fact it is under your pillowcase , i ca n't see this as a problem at all . 
the answer is no ; there is nothing to keep it in place . first , realize that this is n't a `` large '' size , in my opinion , as mentioned in the ad ; the standard pillow is 20 '' x 26 '' , and this item is 11 '' x 22 '' . second , it is n't a casing filled with cooling material and foam as most cooling pillows are -- this has 4 small chambers : two small ones in the center , and two larger ones on the ends . this helps distribute weight so that the weight of your head does not displace all of the cooling material inside the pad . third , if you sleep with an angled slanted pillow , this item can roll slide fold down or off your pillow ; my head keeps mine in place ! ( the one i received does not have a `` rough '' side , or `` non-adhesive backing '' as mentioned in some of the other replies to this question . ) to me , it 's better than not having anything to cool my head at all ... while it may not seem that it helps very much , the proof can be realized if you stop using it ... so it does make a difference ! : ) 
hi ! i have used this one almost 3 weeks . it is really nice ! it is up to you . i put this one under pillow ( pillow should be one layer , also not quilt ) because most pillow was made of cotton for skin . i think you can put shoulder on the top of cool pillow mat . in my case i put my neck & head on the top . it is great ! anyway , i feel my head cool ! further more , i feel my body cool too ! ! i am very satisfied with that ... 
there is no activation needed . when i take my mat out of the refrigerator , i put it under my pillow and the coolness comes up through the pillow . 
yes , just wash off with warm water 
i do not know , but it 's a month after my daughters birthday and we still have them and a good amount worked . some was faulty , but i ordered 2 sets . the problem i had was the cotton candy did n't stick ... i have no idea if i did the cotton candy wrong , or we needed cotton candy training . other then that , it would 've made the party so much better ! ! ! the kids did n't care much , even though it was the most deformed looking cotton candy i ever seen ! the good thing ! the kids loved it as a glow stick ! 
i do n't see why you would n't be able to . i was actually going to do the same for my daughter 's b'day , however , i found one to rent and the sugar mix for 25 dollars at a local party supplier . plus the kids enjoyed making their own so it worked out . if you do use the premade , i am assuming the stick would slide in easily . 
there are 10 sticks , each stick has 8 different functions for the lights . 
yes , each individual cone lights up . they have several settings as well -- you can have the lights on steady or there are different settings speeds for the lights to blink . 
that would depend on your location 
sorry , i do n't know i just use them for few minutes 
just the holder ...

hi , thanks for your question . you may be interested in the following king size bedding by diaidi : 
it is not very large and be aware that it does not have the same texture or colors as the photo posted . 
yes it has red on it 
does not look nearly as good as in the picture and it took over a month to arrive because it was shipped from china . i ended up throwing it away . 
generally very similar . but of course it 's not a clear print , it 's hand painted , and not by van gogh . 
hi ella , yes , it is already stretched with wood frame on the back , which is ready to hang when you get it . thank you ! lily for accmarket 
the actual dimensions are 70.25 '' wide , 19 '' deep and 32.75 '' tall . 
glass panels are attached . does n't look to me like you could remove them . 
yes , it is a greyish wood color . 
it is actually a dark brown metal , meant to look antique . it comes in a few pieces which you put together bu can leave off and keep only the knobs . however the mounting holes are visible but not too much . 
if i remember correctly , it came in two large skinny tall boxes . very very heavy and a ton of pieces . 
laminate over manufactured wood . 
you can not stain this piece as it is not a real wood surface , but vinyl . with a good primer you may have some luck painting it . 
32.5 '' high , 19 '' deep , 70 '' wide 
33 '' 
sure ... there are no pre-drilled holes for the doors ( and they mount from the `` inside '' ) 
the 8 '' pan weighs about 1.25 lbs , the 10 '' pan weighs almost 2 lbs 
checked into this myself and was satisfied with what i found that they are one and the same . gave a skillet to my son and he loves it so bought more for him for this christmas . if you 're still not sure just research the company . hope this helped . 
yes , i have used them on my induction cooker . 
yes , i love these . my next purchase will be the square pan . highly recommend . 
i am not sure about the handles . otherwise , they promise , it is sure . i use it on the stove top , and more than happy with it . love it ! 
yes , we love it ! ! 
i have had very good luck with these pans . and use the more than any of my other pans . 
my understanding is that they are . i have not used mine in the oven yet , but would not hesitate to do so . 
it does not come with lids but it is a good product and i have really enjoyed these skillets . i have the a green and blue skillet which did not hold up very long . 
no 
sauder does not reccomend that you paint any of their models . it would void the warrenty . 
w12 ' x h 13 ' 1 4 x d 11 ' 1 2 the cubbies have decorative planks on top and at the bottom that are sticking down and up by 1 2 ' . 
no , the shelves are tall enough but they are only 11.5 '' deep . 
overall ours is 47 3 4 h x 53 1 4 w x 12 1 4 d. small shelf openings are roughly 12 1 4 w x12 3 4 h. large bottom shelf openings are about 24 1 2 w x 12 3 4 h. all measurements in inches . 
52 '' w , 45 '' 1 2h , 12 '' d 
it is that dense cardboard that you typically tack on the back of shelves like this . 
53 1 8 '' wide , 12 1 8 '' deep and 47 1 2 '' tall 
there are holes drilled on the top for the molding to go around the back and sides . it 's a little hard to see in the picture . there are holes drilled for the label plaques . you can get stickers with the finish on them to cover the holes if you would like . 
the outside measures width 33 1 4 '' height 74 1 4 '' depth 12 1 2 '' . the inside of each cube is width 15 1 2 '' height 13 '' depth 11 1 2 '' hope this helps 
hi sherry , this is not solid wood . i imagine a solid wood cabinet like this would be about $ 1200- $ 1500 . but this is not a junky cabinet either . it 's really good quality . believe me , i have had those cruddy ones before that have the finish peel off . this is much nicer than that and is really heavy duty . i liked the first one so well i bought a few more of these for my home and my office . good luck , jeff 
no the openings are 12 '' tall by 11 1 2 '' deep 
yes , they are installed near the end but there is no need to install them at all . 
model 414108 is in the salt oak finish and is more gray than brown but not very dark . these are the only two options that sauder has in this style . 
i 'm not sure on how big the canvas bins are , but the shelves are 15 1 2 '' wide and 11 1 2 '' deep and all will hold 25lbs . ( 50lbs on the very bottom shelf ) 
they are optional . 
no . i checked the manufacturer 's website . this collection only includes tv stands and bookcases . 
yes , the ice pack is included in the purchase . i have n't used the ice pack so i ca n't speak to how cold it keeps the food , but it seems like it 's in a good place to keep both the dip and veggies chilled . overall i love it . perfect size for a healthy snack and dip . 
i ordered three of these ( love them btw ) and they were all different . think i got the turquoise , yellow and and a purple one . you ca n't request colors . so do n't count on getting a particular color that you want . love the ice packs in them tho . 
only one and the dip container is very small . if i had seem this in person i may not have bought it . 
it is nicely dense . i have a king bed made up of 2 twins together and bought this to put on top . you can not tell there are 2 beds and it is heavenly to sleep on . so much better than a plain mattress . conforms to your body nicely but returns to original shape quickly . i can not see a reason to buy a thicker one . 
yes , it will arrive in a large box . you remove it from carton , as the instructions say , let it air out for 48 hours or so . there is a slight odor when you first remove the plastic covering but it soon disappates . love , love , love this product ! highly recommend it ! 
no , it actually stays quite cool . i love this topper . 
sorry i have no clue , what you are talking about ... . but it is just god sent . loving it after great work out ~ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
mine is queen size , 60x80 . 
used it for a replacement bar stool works great , i believe it will fit most standard bar stools not sure of thickness . 
thanks for asking . the manufacturer does n't rate the swivels for specific loads . this is because there are many factors that go into that equation based on the individual chair or stool application . load ratings like this are normally set by the manufacturer of the chair or stool . we can tell you that these are very high quality swivels that are made in the usa to top quality specifications . unlike many swivels , these have a full race set of ball bearings and are pre-lubricated . many others have fewer ball bearings resulting in a partially full track that does n't last as long . - the chairpartsonline sales team 
the shortest distance between two holes is 4 1 2 '' . the widest distance between the same two holes is 5 1 2 '' . 
yes 
no it is not ... hope this helped . 
did you install the plate before you tried to turn it ? ? ? they are well lubed with white grease ... . 
the swivel seams very sturdy , i have 4 kids and they beat the tar out of everything . i do n't think there will be a problem with the stools having a back , like i said they are very sturdy . i would make sure the size is right . if you get the right size they go on like butter . oh yea i forgot , my stools have a backrest and the kids are always leaning back on the stools , i do it too . bill 
we do n't currently have a swivel available like what you described . sorry we could n't help out this time & best of luck in your search . 
yes , no problem

do n't open the ziploc until it is time to put it on the cake . i actually had raleys make the cake and put it on , so i am no sure of placement . i do know it does not cut easily . when it was time to cut the cake , we ended up peeling the whole thing off . it was very thick and heavy . we did not eat it . but , it was perfect and we got it really quickly . 
send us an email with your order number and your personalization information 
i sleep very comfortable . it keeps you warm , not sweaty or hot . 
i guess somewhere around 20 lbs . i had no problem carrying the box upstairs to the bedroom other than it was bulky . hope this helps you . 
it is just foam . i have not used it yet , but since it is for a sleep sofa and the sheets are usually too big , i think they will be enough over the foam plus the mattress . also , i had seen many references to product odor for foam pads . this did not have any and looks like it will add a lot of comfort . 
standard sheets should fit on this mattress given this topper is only 3 '' it will depend how thick your existing mattress is . 
came with 2 bags . the bags are the heap filter i believe . great vacuum ! i love it . 
i believe it has a 5 year warranty . i am currently shipping mine back to have a problem resolved . electrolux has been very responsive to getting back to me , issuing a call tag , and telling me how to ship it back to get it fixed . i love this vacuum and want the problem resolved so i can get it back as soon as possible . their call center is very helpful . do n't hesitate to call them . 
bag works well and pretty easy to get new ones . the vacuum has a gauge that shows when the bag needs to be replaced . 
yes there is a small multi tool for crevices etc 
no . choose from the models with the larger , motor-powered , carpet heads . 
i do n't see why not ? 
10 amp 
it is about 9 feet 8 inches give or take an inch . very long ! 
it does 
we 've been very satisfied with this vacuum and no problems with the hose kinking 
substantial ! very nice quality . i bought these for a ladies group to share . as an after thought , i wish i did not get upholstered chairs because i do n't know that others will take as good a care of the fabric chairs as i would . so , if you are going to `` share '' or store in the garage , you may want to consider all plastic chairs . otherwise a beautiful , dressy , high quality set . 
the chair are fairly strong because i weigh 220 # and they have held up well for mee . 
light beige ... .nice quality for the price 
the top is 30 '' x 30 '' and it stands 26-3 4 '' tall 
i am not sure of the exact height . the manufacturer 's information should have that . i will tell you that i think they are a little low . i am 5'8 '' so i guess it 's relative . i would measure for you but i do n't have access to them right now . 
on my page there is only one table and chair set in tan . the chairs are fabric . it is very nice set . i will have to check into what you are referring to . 
33 3 4 x 33 3 4 
yes 
the table is 34 inches square and about 28 inches high . i have a card table that is slightly smaller and another that is slightly larger . hope this helps . fg 
yes . it 's a very well made set . 
my pantry door is approximately 95 '' . i hung the racks over the door using the hooks both because i wanted the extra stability and because at that height , i find them rather unobtrusive from the outside . with all three sets installed ( the lower 2 screwed into the door ) , the bottom basket is about 19 '' from the floor , which works well for me . i 've been happy with these . 
there are a total of 8 baskets per package . the baskets are 17 '' wide x 4.5 '' deep ( out from wall ) , and there were 4 with a height of 3 '' , 4 baskets with a height of 2 '' there are 4 added single-wire support brackets that can be added above the regular baskets to effectively make them all capable of holding much deeper items than 2 or 3 inches . no , a standard dvd or cd case does not fit or sit well in these baskets . hope that helps . 
it is over the door and you have the option of screwing it to the door also . i hung it on the door and used command metal hooks no . 17067-vp to fasten it on the sides to keep it from moving . 
yes , it comes with 3 of the wires to help hold taller items . 
sounds like you 'd use nothing - if so , it will wibble a lot , not be stable . it does need to be anchored so it does n't move back forth 
yes , they should be in there . in the box you should have the baskets , the long pieces that connect together to form the rails and a few attachments that help keep your items in the baskets ( they are little bars that hook into the rails . ) 
there are three `` track '' sections , which means it can be setup as 1 , 2 , or 3 units . however , there is only one set ( 2 ) brackets that hang over a door . this means wood screws would be used in place of the brackets . 
sadly no . the unit is 18 inches wide . 
i do n't know but the shelves can be placed wherever you need them . if you contact the manufacturer and ca n't get more shelves , i would try improvising with narrow plastic baskets for your small , lightweight items . 
do n't quite understand your question ... i have it hung on the inside of my pantry door ... screwed into the door ... though a person can use the hangers to just hang it ... .i wanted it firm against the door and not flopping ... you could use it on either side of the door ... your choice . 
no . it is 120v 60hz . 
we keep the litter box in the basement so i ca n't answer that directly . but we 've found it even removes the scent of a holiday candle or baking from the surrounding rooms . 
do n't know about tobacco odor as there is no smoking in our house , but if someone passes gas the fan cranks up to high in a matter of seconds : ) 
while you do hear the unit , it is n't loud at all and should n't interfere with tv . it 's a bit like a small fan - not half the sound of an oven vent or a large electric fan . 
absolutely . i would not use an ionizer and i turned mine off . very easy to do ! just press one button . on the front of the unit , there are various buttons with lights underneath . the very bottom button looks like a star ( ? ) if this is lit blue , the ionizer is on . to turn it off , press and hold the button until the light goes off ( this take a few seconds ) . good to go , without ions . 
the base is 8 '' d x 11 '' w. the unit is 8 '' d x 14 '' w . 
no and was not designed too . 
not right next to you , as far as possible away in the same room . at first i was sleeping under it , and it dried out my hair , my throat and i had difficulty swallowing . it works just not meant to be close to you . 
we have a massive great dane that sheds constantly . it does n't pull as much hair as my honeywell does but whenever she walks in the room it changes colors and boosts the output . so keeps it free of odors and small stuff but does n't really get all the hair . but placement does matter ! 
the unit includes one hepa and one carbon filter . i ordered the additional filters for replacements . the carbon filter should be replaced after three months of continuous use , and the hepa should be replaced after 12 months of continuous use . note : the front panel has lights to indicate when a filter is due to be replaced . it glows yellow for a several weeks then changes to red , so you get plenty of advance notice that a new filter is due . 
hello sir , if i understand your question correctly , your asking if there is a manual mode speed adjustment in which you can control each of the fans speeds without interference from the automatic mode - if so the answer is yes . this unit provides excellent control functionality allowing the user to manipulate the speed of the fan in any configuration . the only exception to this is the 'aera+ mode ' which can only be leveraged in automatic mode . i hope this helps answer your question . i myself am very pleased with this purchase given the deal i found - it was a 'deal of the day ' that also , ( if one paid attention ) , had a coupon to clip for additional savings . by the time i reached checkout , i owed only $ 109 . after using it for sometime now , i would have easily paid what they are asking for today . anyways , let me know if need any additional information . regards , -a.farrow 
here is the list of california certified air cleaning devices which test for ozone emissions these fellowes are on it just do ctrl + f and type in fel http : www.arb.ca.gov research indoor aircleaners certified.htm 
label on the unit says : `` made in china . '' 
using mine to cover great room kitchen and bfast nook ( open floor plan ) approx 350 sq . wife is allergic to everything . she 's pleased with this device . nuff said . 
it comes with one each . you have to pull them out and take the plastic out though . 
i did ! no more sneezing when i wake up in the mornings ! 
to the best of my recollection it was standard us voltage : one type of plug , and no switch for voltage selection . 
no , not all all . we love ours . the filters last a long time . it blows great and is quit unless you have it full blast . we run ours on low , and on high at night for the fan noise . i never smelled anything from it , even when the filter needed changing . good luck . 
i have not figured it out . i have tried but it will not work ... . sorry 
i have used this temporarily in my kitchen after i burned some food in the oven . it removed the majority of the smell and smoke . 
hello it really doesnt bother us because we look at it as pieces of puzzles put together . we love what we bought . with regards to the space in between the pictures , we put like an inch of space in between but that would all depend on how you wan na do it . 
ca n't remember if it comes with a guide . we just did measurements and it came out fine . just keep an eye on the distance between the panels so they match . 
it is made from canvas on a stretched frame ... .so i do n't know if it might be effected by the heat ? ? ? ? it is beautiful though ... sorry if that does n't give you the answer you are looking for . 
it 's really hard to tell . it is 3 sections of canvas , but my best guess is that it is printed . it is however so well done that it looks like a painting . we really love it . 
i believe it came with the parts . 
i do n't think so . 
yes they do fit under table and do n't stick out 
19 in 
these chairs are really decent for the money . bought them not intending to use them very much , but use them every day . legs are black on both the black leather and the wine colored leather chairs that i have . husband and son are both over 210 pounds -- -- chairs support them great , and are also wide and comfortable in the seat . sturdy enough to stand up to two climbing grandchildren as well . i am 100 percent happy with this purchase . 
it does not have hard wood bottom . this has thick sturdy metal wires , they are very comfortable . i highly recommend these chairs ... i love them . 
chair is black legs espresso 
they are accurate 
no , they been packed two in a box . 
yes , it is . 
hi sarah sorry it took me so long to respond . the height of the back cushion is almost 2 feet tall . when i sit on the chair it comes up just below my shoulders . 
unfortunately , this item is shipped in a set of two within one box . therefore we will not be able to sell for one instead of two . 
we have been trying to change the listing , but amazon would n't allow us to do so . still working on it . 
dear customer , we are not selling this item at this point , because we are trying to fix the listing , it 's supposed to be a set of 2 instead of a set of 4. we have not changed the price . 
furnituremaxx dose have them instock with cheaper price . it is set of 2 stools , not set of 4 
the listing is for set of 2 , not 4 stools . 
the stools are a perfect fit for under the table and not in use . nothing sticks out . you also have a lot of leg room under the table when you sit . 
each leg has a hard plastic nylon , button-like slider or bumper on the bottom . the wood of the stool 's leg would not touch the floor . would those bumpers mar a wood floor ? maybe . the pads are not wide , about 1 2 or so . the stools are light and sliding them around to reposition should n't hurt the floor . sliding around while sitting in them might mar the floor , but this is difficult to do with a backless stool . you have to stand and take your weight off the stool to reposition it , much like you will have to do if you use a carpet . for light normal use i do n't think a rug is necessary . another option would be to buy wider bumpers at the hardware store . i have hardwood throughout the house without any rugs . i put nylon bumpers on any furniture ( dining room chairs for example ) that get pushed back and forth under a table and there is no marring of the floor . 
they 're posted it the listing : table dimensions : 32 inch wide x 24 inch long x 34 inch high chair dimensions : 19 inch wide x 13 inch long x 24 inch high ; 
yes , however i did put a clear acrylic stain on the top , this will keep it nicer longer . 
i 'm 115lbs . if they are assembled well they are actually sturdy enough for twice my weight but , that 's a guess . 
yes 
thank you for your interest in our product . this item you are inquiry for is p3102 which will be shipped through fedex under one tracking number to your door . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
all you need is a phillips screwdriver 
yes it folds flat with all four panels together for storage . the panels can also be flush with each other if you want a flat picture wall..just have to balance it so it does n't fall over . i 'm very happy with this piece , btw . 
it is canvas so it likely will not block much sound ... .definitely block whatever it 's in front of 
thank you for your interest in our product . unfortunately , furnituremaxx ship to lower 48 state in united sates only . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
yes it is . i do that every night and it works great . 
i would not trust it to be waterproof . i would try a store like rei for waterproof spray 
it sounds like either your gas shocks are dead or you did not assemble them properly . did you remove the plastic piece on the shock so the pressure would reduce ? i have 4 and they work perfect . watch the short video below . https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=7kfd_o3n-xy 
ok , the seat is one continuous piece , but i measured them like they were separate . back is approx . 14 '' h , seat is 17 '' l ( from the very back of seat to the front ) , and 17 '' across ( from left to right ) and they are approximately 2 1 2 '' thick everywhere . maybe a 1 4 '' thicker towards the middle , or it could just appear that way . hope this helps . 
not at all . the have a hard rubber piece so thr medal is not touching the floor . 
box was 24 '' x24 '' x36 '' for each box containing 2 chairs ( approximately ) 
more than a little but its very quick and you do n't need any tools . the picture on the instructions was n't very good so that was the hardest part - just figuring out how to put them together . once you know how it goes quick . 
i do n't know the weight of one but on the box they come in , the two of them , along with the box and the few added things in the packing comes out to 38lbs . i would estimate 16-17lbs each . 
the top of the seat , but there is a little padding above that , so make it 24.5 . 
yes 
i 'm underweight , so it holds my weight well and you feel at ease ( not worrying about it tilting or collapsing ) , but you do n't get the `` sturdy '' feeling . on the warranty , i think i 'm holding all the papers that came with it , it does n't say anything about warranty , but it does say that you have a 30-day window for requesting replacements for missing damaged parts . 
the stools are comfy , though i 've only sat on them while at the breakfast bar in my kitchen , whilee having a meal or a snack . i have not sat on them beyond 20 minutes or so ... 
you 're not supposed to take it off 
i would n't say the chairs are easy to tip over when used the way they are intended . i think they are well made because the round base is almost as wide as the seat . if the 2-year-old that you place on the chair is one who thrashes around , i definitely would n't leave him unattended . such action certainly could cause the chair to tip over . just the fact that the chairs swivel could cause the child to fall , especially if he stands on it . 
not if you have a standard height counter top . we bought these because they were adjustable so high . even at their lowest setting , i is highly unlikely . 
yes , 2 stools come in a box ... .so for 4 stools , order quantity ( 2 ) . price mentioned is for set of 2 stools . 
we actually have 4 of these chairs on an exotic brazilian wood floor with no issues . the bottoms have a rubber ring around it that they rest on . i would recommend if you buy them to periodically lift them up and see if the rubber is coming off like i do just to insure your floor . we 've not had any issues with the rubber coming off so far . if you are anything like i am i 'd rather toss a $ 50 chair then ruin a several thousand dollar floor . hope this helps you . 
measured from seat ... ..12 1 2 '' . they are very comfortable , and very easy to put together . my husband is 6'2 '' and is approx 300lb , and is very pleased with them . 
about 20 inches . 
the chairs are very light weight and could easily be pulled over by your little ones ! 
if you are pulling on the side handle while sitting on the chair and nothing is happening , you either forgot to remove the black protective cap from the center post ( lift ) or you have it on upside down . 
it 's about 18 inches wide and 15 inches deep . 
yes , i think it can be refinished or painted . the main structure is finished wood . it could be sanded so it can take another coat of paint , or you could strip it . the bottom of the top storage box is some sort of pressed-board , but it 's fairly thick , and held by wood on all sides . the back panel on the storage section is a narrow panel of the pressed-board , but a little thinner . it 's held by slots in wood on all sides , as well . ( those are where you do n't see them , anyway ) . there 's no particle board . it 's a pretty sturdy piece , and can be sat on to put on shoes , ( if you choose to store them on the bottom rack ) . note re : ginger mahrie 's comment : i did not have to reinforce the lid on mine . it 's designed to be sat upon , or at least i sit on it , and it does n't `` bow . '' always wise to be cautious , though , if you wish . 
definitely ! i 'm 230 and it does n't even creak when sitting down . product is well built and easy to assemble . 
hi nancy , the storage area is 4.125 '' deep . there are , however , two small pieces of wood attached to the underside of the lid that take away about .75 '' from those two spots . i 'll try to upload a picture for you . 
there is a 3 '' clearance between the bottom shelf and floor . 
4 pair of mens shoes , 5 pair of womens , i also raised mine up so i can fit shoes under the shelf . 
it needs to be about an inch from the wall in order to allow the back edge of the lid to hinge open without out touching the wall . hope that helps . 
i 'm not at home at the moment , but i think it 's about 2.5 or 3 inches . most of my shoes fit under the shelf , but thicker shoes , like clogs , get put on the shelf . 
boots would fit if you lay them down 
yes , it 's 13 1 2 in wide . 
it can not be lowered . 
yes , it is made from solid wood , though is a cheap wood . for the price i really do like the bench . my husband weighs about 220 # and it is solid enough to hold him . 
the cherry and white shoe bench are same in dimensional sizes . 
my husband and i have sat on this bench at the same time , our weight combined is about 300 lbs , and there was no sign that the bench could n't support our weight ... so at least 300 . 
it does n't have the slat board in the back but it is finished and looks fine to be seen . 
i 'm not at home , so i ca n't measure right now . but i can tell you that we use it as a `` mud bench '' and store gloves , hats , even my daughter 's ice-skates fit in there . i 'd say it 's about 5 inches deep . the shelf underneath holds maybe 4 pairs of shoes . 
8 inches between shelf & bottom of storage compartment . 
itbisvabout 4 inches deep 
i do n't think it would stand up to dampness . 
there is a parts list that shows where every piece goes . just look at it carefully and you will see that this picture parts list is the directions . very easy . 
no , i measured it and there is a little less than 8 inches clearance between the bottom shelf and the bottom of the seat . 
yes 
it 's a very stable cart 
2.5 interior height , 12.5 wide & 11.5 deep . i keep steak knives , paring knives loose . 
the width is 19 inches . 
14.5 '' wide x 13 '' deep x 10 5 8 '' high 
if you do n't need to pull it out frequently and the height is ok , there is no reason to use the wheels . you might want to use casters to keep your floor from being scratched . 
the correct dimension is dimension : 19 '' x 15 '' x 34.5 '' h please disregard any other dimension for this item as it was a system error . 
thank you for your interest in our product . the item you are inquiring has a width of 22 ' keyboard slide . thank you 
thank you for your interest in our product ! the height from the floor to the bottom of the drawer is approximately 25 '' . we hope this information will help . have a wonderful day ! 
there 's 5 total pieces if i recall : 2 leg stands , back spine , back brace , and the desk top . it 's pretty sturdy and i think it would hold up to quite a few moves . easy to assemble and to take apart ( less than 10 minutes ) , i have only moved it once and no loss of stability with that . 
it 's already assembled . the whole desk only took me 15 mins to assemble and it is wood , not particle board . 
very solid construction . not that i 've tested the weight limit , but i would guess over 100 lbs 
no 
not that i know of ... i tried to look it up but could n't find any . i think the best you could do is look for the same color as the brown desk . now i am wondering myself how to get a bookshelf that will match ! my current bookshelf is falling apart ! best of luck.. 
yes , the drawer opens up then if has a latch on each side to drop down the front of the drawer . it is elegant desk that i am satisfied with it . 
hello , this particular computer desk is made of solid wood . hope this answers your question . thank you ! 
yes it is . 
the instruction sheet does n't say anything about it . my husband is around 220 lbs and they 've held up fine for him . they 're very sturdy . i hope that helps . 
just measured . back of seat is 33 '' . hope this helps . 
they 're metal . 
you ca n't lean back on them , they just give a slight lumbar support , more to push you into a forward position . i could sit in this for a long time , it is just like sitting on a regular hard chair , very slight cushioning . my only complaint is that the foot rest is attached to the swivel so if you want to swivel , which is what i tend to do when i am thinking , you have to grab onto another object . 
i doubt it will scratch the floor since there is a plastic protection ring on the bottom . i assume its there for a reason . 
15.5 inches 
it attaches on the bottom with screws . it does not come off when lifted 
the base of the seat 
you can contact the manufacturer ( roundhill furniture ) for replacement parts . the first set that we ordered contained a `` bubbled '' rubber lip around the bottom of the base . just call them up and they can get you hooked up with a replacement piece . 
thank you for your interest in out product . bar stool comes in color black white red only . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
it fit a 1 2 sheet cake leaving appox a 1 inch boarder all the way around it was very nicely done with really vibrant colors 
i 'm getting all your emails , just send me your order number and the name you want , the same way you contact me now 
yes , no meat or animal products 
the edible sheets have a shelf life of 12 months when kept in a sealed bag . so you can order yours today even if you do n't use it now . be sure to keep it in a sealed , airtight zip-lock bag . they do not need refrigeration ! keep the image at room temperature , out of any direct light 
we placed it on a 1 2 sheet from the grocery store and it fit perfectly . just make sure you heat it long enough with the hair dryer before attempting to remove it from the paper . 
please send me an email with your order number and the name you want . 
there 's a hechscher on the box from the london beis din and underneath the hechsher it says in english : `` manufactured by a jewish company tevilah not required '' there 's also a statement in hebrew that the urn was manufactured according to the psak of rav moshe feinstein & # 1494 ; & # 1510 ; & # 1524 ; & # 1500 ; and that the urn does not require tevila . 
approximately 40 minutes . this pot totally failed after only 8 months of use . the manufacturer replaced the pot with a new one under warranty . the last hot water i purchased was made by regalware but has been discontinued . it worked flawlessly for 10 years . 
no 
it 's not hot enough to burn you , but i would keep it away from children . i run mine 24 7 
this machine is only 110v not 220v . 
no i have n't had this problem 
so , from what i understand , it keeps the water at a hot temperature , versus the regular switch will continue to boil until water eventually evaporates . 
i would call the manufacturer to get the answer to that question . if you call amazon i am sure they can provide the phone number . you do n't want to do anything that would void the warranty . 
i have n't timed it , but it seems like about 20 minutes ... 
quick enough ! 
i have 3 of these , including the xl . i have a family of six and it has been perfect for 6 small steaks , burgers , a whole tube of sausage patties , etc . all at once . i 've had them for 8 months , and i use at least one of them daily ... the xl the most . so far i 've had no problems with scratches or with the surface just plain becoming less non-stick . i try not to use metal utensils , and i do wash them by hand . they are very easy to clean and take up too much room in dishwasher anyway . i know where you 're coming from . i had about decided to purchase a cheap pan and plan on replacing it yearly , but so far , so good with these . ask in 5 years , right ? that 's the test . 
actual cooking surface is approximately 10.5 '' 
i have the extra large one and it 's about 3-4 '' deep . i do n't believe there are any bad chemicals in the coating . you do have to treat it with oil before the first use . hopes this helps . by the way , i love mine . 
yes , the pans have metal ring on the bottom and they are okay for use on ceramic sttoves . 
no lid came with mine . i 'm going to contact the seller because the answer posted here says that a lid is included . meanwhile i have a silicone splatter shield that fits just about right , but it ca n't seal the pan because it 's intended to ventilate . it works for frying though . starfrit 93038 silicone splatter screen here on amazon . 
you know i 'm not sure but they are not terribly sturdy , altho i love them ... i 've had them drop and crack so as not to be usable..bummer.. so it 's not likely an item that will last a long , long time . 
they work very well . just do n't overfill , because the contents do expand in the freezer . 
the container is about 6 '' tall , top diameter is 4.5 '' and bottom is 3.5 '' in diameter . capacityy is 1 quart . 
it is on the package . 
i made some with leftover smoothie this morning and 4hrs later they 're frozen . i was n't checking on them regularly though . 
yes , good quality . safe for kids . 
hi susan , no popsicle needed -- -just squeeze from the bottom -- -- make your own frozen margarita 's ! ! ! yummy 
no 
no . they 're actually a soft silicone . 
they do n't need to propped upright but i wish they came with a little stand so they 'd freeze evenly . we 've had zero spills when they 're laid on their side with the top on securely . 
currently , like the majority of our competitors , they are being manufactured in china . so far we have n't found a cost effective way to have them made in the usa . however , we are definitely looking for a way to make that happen for our awesome customers ! we would , without a doubt , love that as much as all of you . 
i put them in the dishwasher and they seem fine 
no . they get gobbled up too fast for melting to be a problem . 
i 'm not a kid : ) but i love popscicles - and i would say no to the hands getting too cold . i do usually grab a paper towel but it does n't last long enough for my hands to get cold . 
i would try to . i installed my unit in a 500sqft rectangular room . place the unit on a solid exterior wall with easy access for electrical and drainage . mount the exterior condensor above ground with the supplied wall mount . it looks clean and will be out of the way . i did have two leaking valves that cost me to have the unit recharged after 2 months of operation . either than that the unit is good for the price . 
for the indoor unit , yes , included . for the outdoor unit it is not needed if you will mount on a slab . otherwise brackets are available as optional accessory . 
this specific model can operate in heating mode down to 5f . heat pumps work by finding heat in the atmosphere and pumping it inside . there is no heat in the air at sub zero temperatures . use a space heater as a backup . 
absolutely.. heat pumps can not function without a defrost logic in heat mode . all pioneer units have a very sophisticated , self learning fuzzy defrost logic . 
for a perspective , i have a 615 sf one room cabin i built . i used a 18,000 btu ( 1 1 2 ton ) inverter unit here in northern missouri . even at 10 degrees below zero , it easily kept the house nice and warm . it was well insulated with 12 '' walls of r-32 . 
my mini split is model wye018glfi15rl and has a minimum circuit ampacity of 14 a , so i ran 14-2-with ground on 15 amp 220v circuit , to a disconnect then to the outdoor unit . wire harness is supplied for wiring the indoor unit . check out highseer.com for their color sales and technical brochure . 
i do not know . 
poke a stiff coat hanger threw as there is a hole forp the wire and tape the cable to , the coat hanger and gently pull it threw 
answer is between 12k and 18k models . you need to select based on your heat load and insulation level whether to upsize or downsize . 
probably does n't matter all that much , i 'd pick the location based on where the lines need to be run . 
this is a variable speed inverter system . rating capacity in cooling mode is 22000 btu . ( range 10,800 ~ 29,400 btu ) . rating capacity in heating mode 22,000 btu , ( range 11,000 ~ 31,000 btu ) 
mis-wiring 
www.highseer.com is where all the information is available . please click on information library button . 
yes . we used 30amp disconnects 
no problems . you can customize your line set lengths . please see www highseer com . yet max allowed line set length for 9 and 12k models is 65 ' and for 18 and 24k models it is 82 ' . you need to see the specks provided with this product ad ( last picture on the left ) . 
takes between 3 to 6 hours to install . hourly rate changes from place to place . 
couple of cinder blocks is what i used . just put gravel under and call it done 
minimum amps is 16 and maximum is 25. or so it says on the condenser . 
it comes with everything you need for standard installation . 
an inverter means that with out geting to technical is a drive that changes the motor speed . speeds it up and slows it down . you will find that you cant even hear the system run and it will save you money on your power bill . i would suggest an inverter unit . 
http : www.highseer.com pdf wae_wye_15_sales.pdf is the link to the tech specks . it will work down to zero f. outdoor temp . it is a 15 seer unit . it will give you an seasonally adjusted average of 15 btus for every watt spent . assuming an annual compressor running time of 650 hours , total annual consumption would be 520 kw of power . 
sounds like a bad installation 
inverters do not have high start-up amps . they start at zero speed and catch up as needed . so you do not need to worry about this issue . 
this one has a built in defrost . the indoor and outdoor fan stop running when defrosting ( cooling and heating models only ) . from the user manual : `` frost may be generated on the outdoor unit during heat cycle when outdoor temperature is low and humidity is high resulting in lower heating efficiency of the air conditioner . `` . i live in northeast texas and its a rather mild climate so heat pumps work well . 
power input goes into the outdoor unit only . a 4 lead cable ( accessory ) brings the power to the indoor unit , from the outdoor unit . 
yes , they will work.. please assure to clean them 100 % , free of old oil , dust , debris , moisture , etc . 
general rule of thumb is 30 btus per square foot . this can change by some other factors up or down . 
absolutely , works like a charm at least for me it did 
the spigot is acrylic . 
1.38 gallons , or 5.22 liters 
hey james , it 's not a sink into it and forget reality exists kind of couch but it 's certainly comfortable . when i snore too much my girlfriend sleeps out on it and she has no problem . when i have trouble sleeping in bed myself i go out to the couch and fall right to sleep . for the price i could n't ask for anything more . i 've also had no issues with the durability . hope that helps ! 
massive ! ! ! the delivery was transported to my home address and left outside on the driveway . two packages , one with the ottoman and the other with both sides of the sectional . all pillows and cushions are located inside the interior of the couch ( hidden panel under the slouch itself ) 
no . they can not be turned over . the seat cushions are very sturdy and do not show stains . the back cushions get kinda squished after a while but i could probably improve that if i tried . 
it 's very firm , but not so much that it is uncomfortable . i 'm very happy with it . 
thanks for your question , the total length of the sofa with chaise would be 112 '' ( i.e : 78 '' l sofa + 34 '' w chaise ) chaise : 84 '' x 34 '' x 35 '' h sofa : 78 '' x 34 '' x 35 '' h i hope this helps ! 
it is a dark gray 
it was delivered in three pieces . two very large and one large . all three pieces where damaged and you could see the drag marks the one truck driver sent to deliver all the way from the top of drive way around house and down the stairs . i contacted the shipping service provided them pictures and the gave me no help whatsoever . i will never buy anything from amazon again because of this horrible incident . 
the box is pretty big so i do n't think so . i use my own containers . i like the cooler . it 's my second one . 
yes , it will keep it warm for a certain time but it wo n't be hot . overall , we really like this lunchbox . my son used it all school year and now for summer camps . 
yes . 
i usually only use it for cold . the lunch box keeps cold for hours . we love this lunch box soo much i purchased 3 more . 
yes about 6-8 hours it stays really hot warm starts to cool down after that . i have had a hot green tea in the bottle and i drank it after 6 hours and it was perfect ! ! ! 
yes . i have 3. you can put all liquids 
yes , it 's spill proof 
yes , only cold drinks . technically , it will keep drinks warm hot but it 's not recommended to drink out of straw ... could get burnt . 
yup 
the material is plastic . i never use it with oil 
straw detaches . 
almost 7 inches tall . 
no , 1 only 
only if the cover is closed . otherwise will leak is the kid turns the bottle upside down 
on the ninja turtle thermos the straw is silicone . hope this helps 
i have called thermos and ordered replacement straws a few times . it comes as a set , the inner straw and the piece that fits into the lid . very inexpensive . per the thermos site : `` replacement straws are available by calling thermos at 1-800-831-9242 '' . 
not exactly sure what you 're referring to with 'how safe is it , ' but i will say there is no way for the child to swallow any piece of the straw as the silicone piece fits through the top and then there is a complete circle seal on the underside of the top ( if that makes any sense at all ) . the straw then inserts into a silicone pipe looking thing so it 's easy to clean . not sure if this is helpful or not , but as a mom of 2 , i have never been concerned of my child 's safety with this water bottle . 
yes 
no & # 65292 ; it 's one & # 12290 ; 
my daughter-in-law says it 's very easy to clean . the straw pops off for easy rinsing too . 
yes 
my daughter is using it to keep warm water . 
because it is a suction cup of straw.easy to scald . 
that 's how you adjust the adjustable seat . 
it 's about 13 inches square from leg to leg . 
yes . we love these . they will last a long time . 
yes , when lowering . great product 
do n't know exactly teresa but they are extremely well made and solid , my husband is 265 and he sits on one all the time to play guitar . we have 3 on our porch and love them ! 
yes , the seat moves independently of the base . this is how you can raise and lower the seat . it swivels high enough that you can sit at a kitchen counter and low enough to fit under most tables to keep it out of sight until you need it . although it 's so cool that you might not want to keep it out of sight , even if you 're not using it . 
beings it is still winter here -- mine is still in the box . gave it to my husband for his work bench in the garage 
it 's adjustable -- from bar height to table height . 
i do n't know , but every morning we juice at least six oranges or grapefruits and it 's just strong as ever . does not heat up . now , i do n't kniow about commercial use , but for normal family use , this is the best . so easy to operate and to clean . hope that helps . 
i have osteoarthritis with enlarged joints in my fingers and at the base of my thumbs as well as obvious weakness in both hands . i 'd been using a lever style press to juice 10 lbs of lemons every couple of weeks ; this required hand strength and definitely put stress on the joints . my daughter insisted that i needed an electric juicer so , after reading numerous reviews , i purchased this one . i am now able to juice 10 lbs of lemons in one third the time that it took previously with considerably less arthritic hand pain . you only need to hold a lemon half firmly on the spinning reamer and the machine does the work . someone else will have to speak to using this juicer with rheumatoid arthritis but it has made citrus juicing easier on my arthritic hands . 
very easy to clean the epica citrus juicer . this is the most well thoughjt out juicer i have ever seen . it is well sealed where it should be with no nooks and crannys for the pulp to get stuck in . very few moving parts and the ones there are come out easily and are easy to clean . the basket itself will catch some pulp , as will any strainer basket , but if you just run it under water upside down , it 's easy to clean . what impressed me most about this unit was really the build quality . it 's a quality piece of equipment , well designed and well constructed and it just looks really good . i ca n't recommend this juicer highly enough . 
it is a very thick plastic , very sturdy . 
you have a clearance of just over five inches under the spout . if your glasses are taller , simply pour the juice into something shorter , such as a measuring cup , and transfer the juice to the glasses . 
not 100 % pulp free . it captures a lot of pulp in the strainer but not all . 
it 's tolerably quiet , it 's not a whisper quiet but i do n't find it as loud as my coffee grinder . all in all it 's a very good buy . 
not if you want to connect it to 120 volt after the round in the dishwasher . 
it 's does n't clog easily ! i love this juicer ! 
probably is . try to buy anything made in the u.s.a. & you will find that our money grubbing politicians have given our manufacturing to china . 
no 
yes 
they are a hard plastic so i would n't think you could easily cut them . 
no idea . 
am not sure . 
i have no idea , but i 'm assuming not because if they were it would be on the packaging . i just needed some cheap , temporary straws at christmas time that were a little stronger than disposables . we do still have them and people still use them from time to time . but if you want the good ones , i 'd get the stainless steel . those are supposed to be best for health . 
just mattress and box spring . i think there are better mattresses out there for a comparable price . 
hi william b - this bed is both firm and soft . i had my doubts at first but this bed is the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in . i have back problems and when i lay in this bed i do n't want to get up lol . it is worth the money . it is shipped via fed ex and arrives in a two piece box . when i first saw the box i said o boy i made a mistake but i did'nt this bed comes already assembled all you have to do is take it out the box , unfold and your good to go . this is an awesome bed you will not be disappointed at all . regards , holly k- 
i do n't have any idea if this is a firm set or not because this was a gift for my daughter and i have n't tried the bed on personally ( she lives in new orleans and i live in new york ) . i will say that my daughter says the bed is fantastic , so i hope this helps you -- -- please stop sending me these e-mails . 
about 2in wide and about 1.5-2in tall . a good size for making candy or cute ice cubes . i 'm using mine for frozen dog treats . 
i use it for making soap so i have no idea how would hope up in the oven . but the butterflies are small like the size of an ice cube so i would n't want to try to grab it out of the oven 
yes it appears to be silicone . 
under the handle there is a water level indicator which is a window of plastic . look at the second picture and you will see what i mean . this is not glass , it is plastic . 
the range of teamperatures are 60c 140f , 70c 158f,80c 176f , 90c 194f , 100c 212f . yes , it displays the temperature in either celsius or fahrenheit . it will go back to celsius if you do not put in 2 aa batteries in base of kettle . if you put in the batteries then it will remember to keep the temperature at fahrenheit and if you take kettle away from base it will continue to show you the temperature of the water . 
from kitchenaid live chat customer service : `` all of the plastic on that electric kettle is bpa free . the dual wall construction keeps heat in while leaving the outside surface cool to the touch . the interior wall is plastic bpa free coated to protect the interior from mineral buildup . '' 
kitchenaid give this product a one year warranty . 
no 
i am sure it is not possible . 
my son checks it before he makes his coffee and it is 212 degrees . i love this kitchenaid pot . i used to use a regular stove top tea kettle , this is much better . 
hi . it is not exposed . thanks 
1500w 
china 
there actually several plastic parts that contact the water , not just the window . there are two screw covers washers on the bottom , and a strainer that the water passes through when you pour it ( to keep sediment that forms on the bottom of the pot out of your tea ) . this strainer is removable , but the other plastic parts are not . 
the kettle is completely stainless steel on the inside . there are two small bpa plastic covers for two bolts at the bottom and bpa plastic window along the side with the measurements . the pour spout is also stainless steel . 
yes 
can confirm that the plastics used are bpa free . i just chatted with kitchenaid and they confirmed its bpa free and that there are minimal amounts of plastics in the device 
it 's made in china . thanks 
yes , one year : http : www.kitchenaid.com digitalassets kek1722sx warranty_en.pdf 
have experienced no problems like this . 
no the start button must be pressed to activate it at the certain temp you want . simply applying power to it will not set it in motion to boil or heat water 
no , the power in europe is to high it will blow the kettle up . 
oh , no . it is made in china . 
amps x volts equals watts . this blender is approx . 550 watts . 
i use mine to grind almonds and get almond milk as well as grind peanuts to make peanut butter . i should think it could grind rice too . 
yes , made in the usa ! 
56 ounces 
i 've been making , every morning , a celery and apples juice . it makes it really smooth and nice . the other day i pureed a veggies soup , was really crest . but i 've not tried with other raw veggies . anyhow , i think it will do well . it 's quite a powerful machine and quite silent - for a blender . 
i have had no problem with my plastic pitcher . 
no , manual specifically says 120vac only 
no its a very hard plastic 
yes 
my opinion is no , not appropriate ... 
4 to 5 cups depending on what it is that your are putting in there 
yes . it is nice and smooth 
not sure , but the blender i owned was no good . the pitcher leaked and if not put on base properly the gear will grind down . 
plastic however i belive you can buy a glass one 
no , sorry . it is not a good model . 
if you mean blend as blending into a smoothie , yes , i have been able to blend kale well in my kitchenaid . 
110v 
yes , this is good for making smoothies. , thanks 
550 watts 
hi . the difference is that the 1575 model has the diamond shape pitcher . i do n't think that there is much difference with the wattage . thanks 
550 watts . i considered the ninja but it was too large for our counter space . i chop ice and some food processing with this blender , besides making protein shakes ( fruit , powder , ice and liquid every day since i bought it . i love the locking feature so the blender does not move when being blended . i am extremely happy with the one i purchased . 
i personally do not trust for very hot food or liquid . my preference is glass as the best choice . unfortunately very few glass pitcher blenders are offered in contrast to polycarbonate , etc 
no 
yes , i do it all the time . it is no problem . 
yes , absolutely 
no , the carafe is some type of plastic . it has no plastic smell to it , however . 
no they do n't make glass for this model . the only glass one is the ksb565er model which i only have red at this time . thanks 
i wash the carpet the first time with hot water and much less soap than they recommend and then i go over the carpet once more quickly with just hot water to pull up any soap residue and more dirt . it works really well and the carpet stay clean longer because their is no soap residue , that 's your downfall . hope this helps , i 've been doing it that way for many years . 
yes , there are attachments that can clean the fabric on a couch . 
vacuum first 
i use mine on tiled floors almost daily , it does a great job . i put a little lysol in the water , works wonderfully for pet odors . it does get the grout as well . love it . 
this one has great extraction , which is the key part of a carpet cleaner . i have owned dozens of carpet cleaners and have seen no difference from more expensive models . 
around 10 pounds . small footprint , compact design . consider something with a more powerful motor 
not really . i have found you do n't really want the water to be too hot . just hot tap water and the cleaning solution should be fine for 95 % of home clean ups . this bissell 's heating element keeps the water warm and that 's all that 's really needed . 
i can help you with that . i used it on my microfiber recliners & my micro suede couch . worked perfectly ! 
no , but it does n't take up too much room , about the same as a large upright sweeper . and our floors are cleaner than when we pay a professional carpet cleaner . 
i have berber , but i think you can . 
i would definitely think so . it 's just like the rubber mats if you ever worked in a kitchen . 
i think it will , the mat body that takes up most of the surface is about 3 8 '' thick , and about 1 8 '' is the more flexible compressible `` donuts '' that surround the holes in the mat body . but , as you add weight you may lose some air circulation airflow under the mat , or at least at the contact points of your equipment and the mat . the mat itself is high density rubber and quite heavy . 
i think it would , though i have n't used it in that situation . 
yes 
yes . no idea how you would connect them though . 
the sheets lock together on 2 sides . we installed these on the floor of an octagonal bar with a center island , they locked together easily . 
the answer has been provided in the description : 15 pairs `` standard , '' 3 pairs per shelf . but keep in mind that the depth can only accommodate size 9 max , so for shoes larger than 9 , you 'd need to store them side way , but would take up more space . also , you would be able to fit more ladies ' dress shoes . 
12 3 4 ( d ) x 23 9 16 ( w ) x 39 7 8 ( h ) 
yes 
its 1 4 inch painted carboard . but you will see the twenty or so small nail heads that you attach it with . i have it back to wall . i love it . god bless you 
11.5 x 36.5 each door 
hello . sorry , fedex needs a around a week to deliver , thanks . 
hello , sorry , can not be stackable , thanks 
no , it is free standing . 
hello , it is the link for europe , thanks : http : www.amazon.co.uk postage-wooden-cabinet-louvered-hc-005 dp b00fvtpk5u ref=sr_1_8 ? s=kitchen & ie=utf8 & qid=1401111428 & sr=1-8 & keywords=homecharm 
i do believe it 's particle board , no worse than some of the cheaper ikea stuff . ( i just wrote a review for this product . ) 
it can be reused . 
yes , it just has to have a place for the flower ( anchor ) part to rest . that 's usually within the drain . 
i do n't see why not , as long as you take the drain stopper out it should slip right down ! 
you can clean it and keep reusing it , but most people do n't want to touch what they pull out of their drain . it 's inexpensive so i just throw it away and replace it with a new one . i did n't have to replace it for 4 months . 
the middle compartment has an opening approximately 12 '' wide with a 10 '' deep pocket . i have a 13 '' macbook pro and it does not fit unless i put it vertical in the pocket . it sticks out a little bit and makes me nervous that it might fall out so therefore i do n't use it for that purpose . hope this helps . 
the caddy is about 22 '' wide and 10 '' tall . it has three straps 2 '' wide , which just come off the top edge of it . they 're 13 '' long with 8 '' of velcro . the other half of the velcro is on the back of the caddy itself , so the straps wrap all the way around the sideboard and velcro back onto the caddy . see the third picture in the listing . 
my daughter has one and her mac fits in it well . sturdy but have to secure velcro straps well . 
no , it wo n't fit around a sideboard of a bed unless you are talking less than total 8 inches . works ok on a bunk rail as shown but you ca n't put much weight in it . would not purchase it again . 
the main point of a conical is for the yeast to settle in a manner that when you rack your precious beer yeast and trub dont come along . thats why there is a valve on its side . if it were only to harvest yeast , there would be only one valve in the bottom . depending on how much yeast and trub forms , you can rack to a secondary , keg or bottle it directly from the side valve . and then repitch that yeast without having to clean and all ... there is always a diy installing a bottom valve ! 
yes , i bought 2 and use them inerchangeably to make beer , wine and hard juices like lemonade and fruit punch ... wash and sanitize thoroughly before switching between different things though . 
plastic . 
no ... it does not come with a temp strip of any kind . 
i have not had any leaks from the spigot , do a water test when you get it . make sure the rubber gasket is seated correctly . 
yes ... it includes everything you see in this picture . 
the spigot hose barb fits standard 5 16 '' and 7 16 '' hose . 
16.5 in . tall-9..5 in wide . awesome . get 2 and use the other for secondary . 
that may be a little too much head room for a 1 gallon batch . i 've been a big fan of brewing that small but it 's been rough finding stuff to work with that size . the spigot , though is actually bit closer to the ground than i was expecting so you 're actually still likely to wind up with trub around the valve . not too big of a deal , but you 'll want to let the first few ounces flush out before bottling . 
hi rob , sorry but we only ship within the united states . 
i use mine on two floor areas : one is smooth 4 '' x8 '' glazed tile laid in a herring bone pattern with slightly sunken 1 2 '' grout lines ; the other is a slate floor with moderate texture ( ~1 16 '' -3 32 '' , but no sharp edges ) , tiles sized 6 '' x6 '' , 6 '' x9 '' ,6 '' x12 '' , and 12 '' x12 '' , also with 1 2 '' slightly sunken grout lines . the braava works beautifully on both floors . a heavier texture could be a problem . 
the 320 does n't have the reservoir . it does not have the fast charging station . and its not have a high capacity battery . i have discovered that this unit works just fine with the regular pads . there are also some knock off pads to purchase both and wet and dry the work is fine . the little small battery recharges in about in two hours or 3 hours . runs for quite a while . i do n't think i actually need the super fast charger to get the work done . after the first few rounds of cleaning . i discovered that i did n't need it running all the time anyway . we have all tile floor and with the target wet and dry cloths and charge times this one works great 
it 's not a vaccum , it 's more like a mechanized mop , so it will just push the sand around . if you use a roomba for the sand first , the braava can then swipe the floors for light stains and fine dust which you can later wash off from the cleaning cloth . as for apt size , i think it 'll be ok , however i 've observed that sometimes if the room has a more complicated shape it wo n't go into certain areas so you have to move the beacon and try again . 
i had typical flat rugs ( without tassels ) , and it never caught or had issues with my rugs . in fact , i can not imagine any way for the braava to get stuck on a rug . the cleaning pad glides along the floor with a 'swiffer-like ' mop ; so tassels , threads , etc do not bother it . anything 1 8ths of an inch or taller , like a rug , will cause the braava to pause and turn . i have a floor air-conditioner with a lip that is just big enough for the robot 's pad to slip under , so it would cry for help when it got caught . but , i just put a bumper of foam to close that 3 4 '' gap , then it never got stuck again - most people will not have anything that will stop or catch it - if they do diy fix is pretty simple . now , if you have tassel rugs some of the swept up dust and hair might get caught on the tassels as it scoots by , especially if you floor is very dusty , but a normal rug with an edge wo n't . if you let the robot sweep up a few times a week the cleaning pad will stay ahead of any major dust bunnies that could get caught by any rug tassels . i will point out again , this is a sweeper & damp mop , not a vacuum . it dusts and lightly wet-mops a floor , and that is it . oh , it does a great job at that , but it is meant for light cleanings . on the other hand there is not much that stops it , yet it is gentle enough that your do n't have to worry . 
the gps guide 
i use a swifer dust cloth and use the sweep mode , and yes , as i have a golden , but having a golden means having to do this every day ! 
stops on it 's own after the complete cycle ( exactly where it started ) ... takes about an hour . i 've had mine for 4 months now and use it at least twice a week -- -no longer sneeze . this , ibraava , far surpasses the hopes i had for it . amazing is not an overstatement -- - 
it just makes beeps . no words . musical beeps . 
i 've been using the braava 320 for the past month on dark chocolate tiled floors which are extremely subject to human and pet footprints . we are very happy with the unit 's performance , it does a great job mopping , i just wished i had read that it does not come with the reservoir pad to keep the cloth wet . instead of buying one now , we 've decided to use a glass of wter and leave small puddles here and there 
i can use any cleaning product on my floors . 
cr 2032 
no . i use my chefalarm for that purpose . it 's made by the same company . 
although i know what a turduken is , i have never actually cooked one . all i can really tell anyone is that the probe on this thermometer is 2 3 4 '' long . this is a very fast-reading thermometer and i 'm very pleased with both of the ones i purchased . hope this helps you . peg leg , maybe this will be of more help . from the original packing slip : `` thermoworks super-fast mini thermometer . item : rt616 '' the entire length of this particular thermometer is approximately 5 3 4 '' and the actual length of the probe is still 2 3 4 '' unless others are referring to another thermoworks model , i do n't know why there is a difference in the probe length . let me know how things work out . i just want you to have a good `` tur '' -- '' duck '' -- '' en '' , not a bad `` turd '' -- '' uck '' -- '' en '' . good cooking ! ! ! 
not more than 3 seconds 
yes both f and c. it works really good . i am glad i purchased it . 
sorry do n't know about thermopop . just know that we are extremely pleased with the super fast mini thermometer . 
the probe is 2 3 4 inches long . i would think you do n't have to go to the very center to get an appropriate reading . remember also , the meat temp will rise at least 5 degrees after taking it out of the oven . 
the temperature range on the super-fast mini is -40 degrees f to 302 degrees f or -40 degrees c to 150 degrees c. that 's according to factory specs , but i had mine read a temperature of up to 380 degrees f . 
no there is no backlight or illumination of the readout . 
i would say it 's long enough for pork and testing a whole chicken , if you test the breast . i will say the full size thermometer us probably the better all around option though if you do n't care about the size 
c'mon people ... this person is n't asking if it is going to mop their ceilings ! i believe the gps signal for these mops works by transmitting from the cube and bouncing off the ceiling to the mopping unit . so , my question too is if you have very high cathedral ceilings , will this appliance work properly to mop the entire floor area ? 
the power charger adapter accepts 100-240v 50 60hz power supply . thus , you can safely plug the charger into your wall socket using the appropriate socket converter to adapt the 2-pin usa plug into whatever pin arrangement in use in your country . i used it in singapore ( 220-240v ) and it worked perfectly . 
hi , yes the cloths are machine washable in warm or hot water . they can be air dried or put in dryer . no bleach or fabric softener . hope this answers your q . 
it would , i have used myself the swiffer brand ones and it worked perfectly . now i have also found that the pad included with the irobot it is quite better , it really cleans better , so i have stick to it instead . 
you need to remember that it is pushing anything on the floor around and not picking or sucking it up as a vacuum would . the microfiber cloth works well as a dust cloth and picks up some of the hair . i would suggest that you vacuum if you truly want your floor free of debris . i have found that the robot works best as a wet mop 
i move one cube from upstairs to downstairs and it works just fine . 
any microfiber will do that is cut to size . the cost of the irobot microfiber cloth is not terrible , and you get cloths that are absolutely perfect , after all , for the machine ! 
i love my braava . i have the dry and wet one . i ca n't tell you how much dust it picks up off the floor . for washing the floor it does the job but i do give it a good mopping with soap every couple of weeks . just remember to put the remote on . 
i 've used vinegar water - with no issues . i 've also used other solutions with no problems . as to why they do n't recommend - you have to ask them , but i 'm sure it 's to cover themselves . 
i think i would work great as long as there are n't deep grout lines . it cleans the tile in my baths having very smooth tile and almost even grout lines wonderfully . 
the device itself is the stopper . so if you want more then 1 stopper you have to buy another device . 
once you 're unable to pump it any longer , it should be sealed . if you pull gently , the stopper remain in place if properly sealed . 
use a towel to wrap around the stopper and twist so that you can screw the stopper up out of the bottle . if a dry towel does n't work , try a damp towel . you have to be careful to not stick the stopper to far into the bottle . 
i have used this on wine bottles . and i do n't know why you could n't use it for carbonated beverages . but i found it hard to use because you have to pump it for a long time . i have used the other wine vacuum sealers . such as - http : www.amazon.com vacu-vin-3-piece-saver-stopper dp b00004saf4 ref=sr_1_16 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1381160966 & sr=8-16 & keywords=wine+vacuum+sealer 
who is the low ? 
maybe , i have a regular xbox on mine and a dvd player . 
no , this unit is not intended to be used as a corner shelf . it is clearly designed to be mounted onto a flat wall . 
the shelf itself is 15 inches wide and 11 inches deep . my bracket on the wall is only 8 inches long because i only have one shelf . i assume the 22.8 inches is the bracket on the wall that will hold the three shelves . i hope this helped . 
i had to return my ematic . emd213 3 unit , as the support bracket packaged with the unit was way too small and the screw holes too far apart to secure to a single stud . so therefore , answer is no , as the unit cannotsupport itself . 
about 18 '' or 19 '' 
15 inches x 1 4 inch 
no 
they are shipped in light grey only . the dark grey black color you see in the photos is how they will appear after you season them to prepare for cooking . seasoning is done with oil , usually sesame . this turn the bowls dark right away . instructions for seasoning are included . 
liquid capacity to the brim is 32 ounces . they are 7-1 4 inches across the top . 
the directions are in the box , first you have to season them in the oven and after use you just wash and dry 
i tried to google for help , and found some discussions but no definitive instructions - 1. good cleaning with warm hot water . 2. cracking the stone bowl seems to be a real concern , and i can see the possibility with fast uneven heating of the bowl if it has a crack in it already . 3. no seasoning is necessary as with the cast iron cookwares . 
the bowls are made in china . 
yes , solid granite 
hi there , i am not sure how many ounces they hold but could probably handle 16 oz . or more . they are the perfect size for a noodle bowl ( entire package of ramen , broth , and additions . ) think very large cereal bowl . i hope this helps . 
i wipe a little sesame or olive oil on them with a paper towel and put them on a cookie sheet and bake them in the oven at 375 to 400 degrees , and then handle them with oven mitts . do n't bake them any higher the oil will start to smoke . the wooden bases hold up very nice , iterated them with a little bit of oil when i first got the bowls . the bowls do turn black with age and if seasoned right are non stick . 
no 
a cotton blend 
its 100 % polyester but is soft and easy to wash. less wrinkles . 
i do n't have the dimensions but it feels like an `` average '' size queen 
i do n't know . i bought a queen size . i think a king size would have fit my queen bed better . it 's really not wide enough . maybe you should get a full size , if you can see both sides of the bed . if it 's against a wall , it wo n't matter . 
i do n't think so . i 'll check when i get home today and let you know . it 's a very nice set , but i have only used the blue sides . 
the spread 2 pillow covers , i like it 
i 'm having trouble with bedspreads being the correct size & have sent several back . i ca n't remember what size i ordered this bedspread in to fit my queen-size bed . the fabric seemed ok but it was too short to cover the pillows so i sent it back . 
yes it is . well made and washes well . 
cotton blend no microfiber . its a nice medium light weight and cleans well 
yes it will work , it 's not too long . 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the information on the kinglinen storefront page , they do not ship to australia . you can view their shipping rates and policies here : 
no 
i 'm sure it 's a blend because it does n't wrinkle much when it 's washed and dried . we launder them often here at the inn . stains cone out easily and they are not fading . just which they were a bit bigger . that 's my only drawback . good , lightweight coverlet . 
king size 
it feels like a cotton blend . washes beautifully . we use them at our inn and wash dry them often . no fading . we use the king on the queen though . would love to find calif king in same bedspread . 
it is 90 '' x90 '' , so you could measure your bed and see where it will fall . with ours , it comes just down to the skirt . i wanted that size because we have a harmonizing green skirt and they look nice together . it actually goes far enough towards the headboard to cover pillows and you would n't need the matching pillow shams , but they come in the package and look good on top . 
it is square , 90 '' x 90 '' 
i do not have the product anymore it has been returned . i have no idea what it is i was so disappointed that it did not fit . all paperwork was put in the bag that i received . 
it is light green and chocolaty brown . it looks great on both sides . 
polyester cotton blend . made in china . nice quality . 
yep , queen size came with two pillow shams . love the set . 
this quilt is pretty sturdy ... i 've had it for months now through several washings , and it is the same soft , strongly stitched quilt . i think it would hold up to a small dog just fine . 
43 '' l. 31 '' h. 15 '' w 
yes . it could hold 2 
yes 
width : 43 3 8 '' , depth : 15 3 4 '' , height : 30 5 8 '' 
the unit is sturdier than it looks , but i would limit the weight on the shelf behind the double door to 50 pounds . the base shelf has more support and could handle at least 100 pounds . 
too short for a counter and small in all aspects , other than that we 're using it 
you ca n't remove it after its built . so if you know you do n't want it in , just do n't add it when putting it together . it 's not adjustable when it 's all together . 
hidden 
no it doesnt have wheels or panels that match either . i bought it hated it . tried to return it , nada . 
hello , it is the white panel in back , thanks . 
i will work for books i would say not a heavy duty book shelf 
hi ! the top 5 shelves are 10 5 8 inches deep , the bottom shelf has a groove and is 1 4 inch shorter in depth great idea ! ( fits my size 9 shoes ) 
hello ; no i do it will work . the dimensions are too small- the depth is just 10 1 2 inches . the height of the top cabinet may not be tall enough , either . 
i do n't see why not , assuming you have researched the dimensions . good luck : - ) 
the shelves are not fixed : ) i have zero storage space and this thing is a godsend ! 
possibly but not easily . they are prepositioned 
1inch 
no . a 10 will fit . 
this cabinet is pretty tall unless it 's a very large bathroom i do n't know if it will fit . 
i probably gave 30 lb each shelf using it for can good and spices 
it appears they are , they work great in my cuisinart coffee hot water maker . have been using these for about 5 months now , i change every 30 days i use coffee maker constantly . 
we first bought the cusinart filters from a specialty kitchen store and paid $ 10.00 for 2 filters . then i looked for them on amazon to get a better deal . the ones we bought on amazon were the exact same filter minus the fancy packaging . we got 15 filters for the price of the 2 from the specialty store . we got a great deal on amazon . each was individually wrapped just like the specialty store . 
i have an ss-700 and pulled out the coffeemaker parts and accessories order form that came with the coffeemaker . it lists the 12 replacement charcoal water filters ( dcc-rwf-1 ) with a price of $ 34.95 and states they can be used with a number of models including model ss-700 , as well as dgb-900bc . appears that would indicate they should fit that model as well . 
this is n't the cuisinart model i have but these filters would fit my model and i would guess they are all the same . 
as far as i know they will work in your coffee maker . 
they might , i 'm really not sure . 
yes ! 
if it looks like the same filter it will probably fit your coffee maker 
l=just under 2 '' x w=1 3 4 x h=1 '' hope this helps ! 
i am not sure about that model but it looks the same as mine and it works well . 
on my cuisines rat coffee maker there 's a plastic insert with a place at the end to snap in the filter . the water passes through during brewing . 
nispira appears to be an import export company owned by hillbright llc out of rosemead , california - owned and operated by one individual , wei wang . filters could be made anywhere wholly at the discretion of mr. wang . 
per my user manual , yes the dcc-rwf will work with the 1100 series . 
totally ! they are 100 % identical to the ones that came packed in with my cuisinart coffee machine ( which has `` designed by keurig '' featured prominently on the box and the machine itself ) . they work great and are soooo much more reasonably priced ! 
yes , you need to have the cusinart keurig coffee maker , these are the smallest filters they have , the newer machines have larger ones 
mine is a dcc 2218. i believe it fits any 2200 numbers . 
yes , that is the coffee maker that i purchased them for 
yes and yes , i am really happy with the quality and fit ! ! never buy any other brand again . 
do n't know . i bought them to fit my cuisinart dgb-600 
sorry i do n't know 
the scale comes with an app that syncs via bluetooth and imports your weight . i have not been able to sync to the health app or to other fitness apps like loseit . 
i have used mine for a couple of months , and all i can see is weight . very nicely graphed weight history , but just weight . 
it reads in tenths . 
2-aa batteries 
i take my ipad in once a week to sync the data . it 'll store the data until then . 
i can only respond that it did not work with android phones as promised . for me , it was just an overpriced digital scale . i called the head office and offered no solutions . 
you can use the app without having the scale . just enter the data manually this applies to most apps . 
no 
60beats scale 
no , no support for healthkit as of now . customer support representative says it might be added to an update . 
twin quite heavy and a little rough fabric wise , look great though ! 
twin ... not good quality 
this item includes a quilt cover and a pillow case . this item is also available in full size . 
it 's about 8 '' long and 1 3 8 '' diameter at the muddling end 
i have not had that problem , as yet with mine . please let us know if you resolve the problem . 
neither the box nor the muddler itself indicate where it is made . 
the length of the handle is 8 inches plus an additional 1.5 inch head . overall it measures a shade over 9.5 inches . hope this helps . 
you could if you use the metal end on a hard surface . make sure to place the ice in a waterproof nylon bag 3-5 min after taking them out of the freezer . cheers ! 
well this is probably a question for the manufacturer i will give you my best guess , and say polypropylene . i love the muddler , but i am no expert in materials so if this is important to you i would ask the manufacturer to be sure . 
i do n't know but for this price , it 's not going to break anybody . it is very well made and balanced and heavy feeling in your hand . 
i washed mine before use , so i never noticed it . 
i would n't feel comfortable sleeping in it for any long duration . it was nice for a few nights , but not the support i personally look for in a permanent bed . 
the directions said 300 pounds . i was using it for a child . it seemed very sturdy to me . 
yes they do 
the dimensions of the item when it is folded and put away are 31.7 '' x 8.7 '' x 38.6 '' . 
i 'm 5'8 '' and about 190 and i could only manage 2-3 days . so , i 'd say no . you might try the air beds . i 've purchased several and they 're pretty comfortable , but i had them leak . one lasted about a year . the others were just a few weeks . that 's why i tried this bed . hope that helps . 
yes , the height is correct , but it does sink in the middle . my dad actually cut a piece of plywood and put under the mattress and i also bought one of the egg foam pads at walmart to give it added comfort . 
about 2.5 ' by 4 ' 
you 'd be cutting it very close , as the bed is 75 inches long , so he 'd only have 2 inches to spare . i added a 3inch memory foam and placed it below the mattress . 
i fold the frame and slip the folded mattress inside the folded frame and then into the cover . you ca n't fold the frame and mattress together . 
no . 
for the first batch , i use sore bought vegan yogurt . after that i use my yogurt . i only use soy mil . 
if you buy a gallon of milk , for say $ 4.50 ( depending on where you live and the type of milk you buy -- whole milk , 2 percent , etc . ) , you will get several cups of greek yogurt out of that one gallon . if you spent that same amount for greek yogurt at the grocery store , you 'll end up with fair less . as for this being labor intensive , it depends on your perspective . all told , i do n't think this takes more than 10 minutes of my time , if i do n't count the time it takes to heat the milk , cook it down , or having it cook in the maker . i do n't count that part because i can be doing other things . put simply , if you eat lots of greek yogurt , then you 'll save money making it yourself . but if you eat it occasionally , then , no , using the storebound dash will not be worth your time . 
yes it does , of course depending on what milk product you use , you can use whole milk and cream , or just whole milk or 2 % milk depending on your preference . 
i do n't see why not . maybe preheat the mason jar with some hot water first . 
yes , the max time is 24 hours . 
no . this is a simple unit with a heating element , separate vat for the making the yogurt , and a strainer and second container to catch the liquid . nothing fancy . no paddles . 
i assume you are talking about the heating of the milk before you pour it into the yogurt maker . ( the yogurt maker is necessary to keep the milk at a warm temp for 8 hours while the yogurt starter multiplies . ) i started out by using a candy thermometer to bring the milk to the required temperature , and it was n't reliable . now i do it `` by sight '' and it works perfectly every time : i stir over medium heat until just before boiling . the milk starts to get little bubbles on the surface . if it breaks into a boil , no harm is done , just remove from heat immediately . the milk is not that fussy . i set a timer to the approximate time it will take - makes me watch carefully at the end . do not underheat - that will be a disaster and the milk will run through the sieve . 
it holds the 5 cups and ends up with 2 or 3 cups . 
yes , just do n't use the strainer . 
diane , i 've used two kinds . one is yogumed . i bought it here in amazon . it was ok. the other one was natural yogurt from a little shop ( not supermarket ) . i liked better the second one , the first was to chalky 
this appliance can make both regular yogurt and greek yogurt . 
hi everett , our greek yogurt makers come wiith 2 bpa free plastic containers which holds about 7 cups each . you would use one at a time and have the ability to use the second container to start a new batch right away if you wish . i hope this answers your question ! 
yes , it goes to 24 hours and then back to 30 minutes 
you can use homemade yogurt as starter for another batch . i save the whey to use for breadmaking , and have found that i can use about 1 4 cup whey as starter for a new yogurt batch , so i do n't have to worry about saving some yogurt to use as a starter . the whey alone works great ! 
i measure 5 cups of milk to make a batch . this amount is slightly more than the white strainer container can strain immediately however after a few minutes the extra fits . or just start with 4 1 2 cups to ensure the strainer fits all . this is a great yogurt maker that i have been using 3-4 times a week . remember the volume reduces greatly but homemade is so nice . enjoy . 
i 've not made almond milk yogurt myself , but a quick net search convinces me that almond milk yogurt is certainly possible in the dash unit since the incubation temperature in the recipes i found was in the 100-110 degree range , which is the temp maintained by the machine . as to how long , the recipes i found all call for homemade almond milk , which adds an extra step ; but other than that , the times for incubation and refrigeration were about the same as for dairy yogurt . you will also have to add thickening agents because of the absence of the dairy proteins that coagulate to thicken dairy yogurt . hope that helps . best wishes , bill 
no ! you can make an almond milk yogurt , but you must use almonds that have been grounded up and soaked . store bought `` almond milk '' has other ingredients in it . 
the ceo of dash company says the following . `` the unit is also made from 100 % bpa-free plastic . '' on the bottom of the dash plastic containers is a recycle symbol with the letters pp underneath . i have researched and this is the result -- -plastic # 5 - pp ( polypropylene ) *increasingly becoming accepted by curbside recycle programs , plastic # 5 is also one of the safer plastics to look for . *it is typically found in yogurt containers , ketchup bottles , syrup bottles , and medicine bottles . hope this helps . 
i do n't see why not . it just keeps it at the right temperature . but if you are making greek yogurt you will only get about 2.5 cups of yogurt after you filter off the whey from 5 cups of milk . 
it comes with a strainer in which you let the yogurt stand in the fridge for a couple hours to drain off the excess liquid . without that extra piece , most folks stretch cheese cloth ( maybe doubled ? ) over a bowl and let the yogurt drain through that . 
i have used this twice , and each time yielded approx . 2-1 2 cups . although the end result was relatively tasty , i found it to be way too much time and effort overall , for such a small quantity . prep time alone is at least an hour , followed by all day sitting in the machine , and then several more hours in the refrigerator . 
it 's fda approved food-grade polypropylene . - direct from the storebound vendor 
no it makes both . it takes an extra step to make the greek yogurt ( straining ) . 
everything but the strainer can go into the top shelf of the dishwasher . they are a bit tall so they may not fit in your model but it ca n't hurt to try . the yogurt maker works great but you do need to play with your milk and cooking time preferences to find the blend that works for your palate . good luck ! ! i love mine ! 
i have not tried this , but it should work just fine . maybe preheat the mason jar with some warm water before pouring in the mixture . 
yes ! you can use any kind of milk ( whole , skim , almond , soy ) . just make sure to add a couple tablespoons of honey . or look for a recipe on internet . 
your bacteria is live , so you can save some and use it make a new batch usually 4 or 5 times depending on the strength of your bacteria . i use starter from cultures for health for everything instead of the stuff from the store since i discovered some companies use milk from cows fed gmo corn to make their yogurt . 
yes , after you heat the milk to 180 , it needs to cool down to 110 , then you add your starter ( or already made yogurt ) and now you are ready to poor it . 
you should be able to use goats milk and yes you do need a starter . you usually just add 1 cup of yogurt to the milk to act as a starter . 
i have not tried soy milk but regular greek yogurt is awesome 
it is 5 inches in depth and 7 inches in diameter at the top ( internal dimensions ) ; it holds 2 1 2 quarts . 
it is 2 1 2 quarts . 
china 
i dont see why not its stainless steel . 
there are 2 rivets on the inside of the pot for each handle ( 4 total ) and there are 2 rivets on the underside of the lid for the lid handle . 
no , it 's only 2 1 2 quarts . 
it is 2 1 2 quarts . 
it is 2 1 2 quarts . 
yes it is wood . it 's a heavy table , but it 's been great for card games . 
the size is 32 inches square and 29 inches tall 
no , it 's a very sturdy , well-made table . 
yes , it would be the perfect dining table for two people . 
our tables are locked up and i ca n't get to them at this time ... .but ... .as far as i can see when we got them and set them up , they are standard size card tables and if a wheelchair can get up close on a standard card table you should be able to do the same on these 
to be honest the legs did not look flared to me at all until i saw your question , so i hope i can explain this . the legs are each at 45 degree angles to their respective corners , and are made of solid 1 '' x2 '' wood . the narrow sides ( 1 '' ) are completely vertical . the 2 '' side is slightly flared out toward the corner by about 1 '' , or about a half-bubble on a level . make sense ? 
it 's heavy . i 'm about your age and i can manage it , but it is heavy . 
yes , fruitwood is a warm color - the table is very rich looking and sturdy . i love it . it is a wonderful compliment to my furniture . you should n't hesitate at all in buying this table . you will love it . 
i have not seen it in that size . but this one is wonderful and is a perfect card table . elegant and beautiful - it 's a wonderful piece of furniture that will compliment any room . do n't hesitate on this . 
i have not tested weight capacity but much studier than the old style card tables . very stable and have used for card playing and as a temporary fly tying bench . 
32 '' x 32 '' 
the container ( which we fortunately still have ) measures 33x34x4-1 4 
it 's possible , but you might have to figure out a way to secure the legs from one table to the legs to the other if you do that or get one of those customized pads to lay across the two tables . seems like a good idea though . note : the legs have resin pads on their bottoms so the table does n't shift around on my hardwood floor which was a nice feature that came with the table . 
it is a pretty heavy table since it is solid wood ... as a result it is very sturdy . i ca n't give you the exact weight but it is significant . 
32 '' ~32 '' and 29 high.bult well 
the table is steady when set up but it is still a card table so is not made to sit on 
my wife and i use these on or glass top stove as we have a couple of them . 
we use it almost every day on a gas stove . heats evenly . the square sharp is easier to fit items that the old round one this replaced . 
of course ! just remember - do not use aerosol spray like pam . pan washes easily with soap and water . do not scrub with brillo . 
as far as i know , there is not . to reduce spatter any good screen cover will do . 
yes ! i love it it is a great pan 
yes 
i do n't know . 
i try to keep the temperature low enough to avoid burning but high enough to get a good `` crust '' . i spray the pan with pam for the grill . being a widow , i make one hamburger or piece of steak at a time . i have n't had a smoke problem but do have a spatter issue with meat that is too fatty . i think you get that regardless of the pan used . i love this grill pan . 
yes it will cook nicely on a glass top stove . 
i do n't know , however , it is not as heavy as cast iron but heavier than most non-stick . i have n't had a problem with sticking or burning although i do n't use it on very high heat . i like to pan a lot . 
i have a glass cook top and have no problem with scratching . the pan stays flat at higher temps . i love it . 
yes , i 've had cheese melt and burn on it from a grilled cheese sandwich , wiped off with a paper towel . looked like i had n't used the pan at all ! 
it should not warp . mine has never warped . 
i have bought the contemporary before in a double griddle which i 've had for years and still is good and i had no problem with this one i really like it 
i have not used high heat but almost always , medium high with absolutely no problem . i love this griddle ! 
i have a gas stove . but it heats pretty evenly on mine . good griddle pan . just do n't use high heat on it . not necessary . 
absolutely not ! ! you never use metal utensils on non-stick cookware . 
no . it does not . 
i really like this pan . i have a large burner on an electric cooktop , so it seems to heat evenly . do n't know how well it would do on a small burner . 
that i do n't know but i will share with you that it warped almost immediately . i still use it , but not as impressed as i had hoped to be . also- can not use areosol sprays such as pam , ( even the olive oil one ) which is a disappointment 
no lids but i was looking and think you can buy them separately 
yes , i use them on my glass smooth surface cooktop 
no they will not . they are aluminum . induction cooktops rely on magnetism to work and so will only work with steel or iron pans . 
i checked with the macy 's rep , and he told me calphalon uses other ones , not a dupoint made i know anolon does = ) 
i own calphalon and swear by it 's durability and even cooking on all surfaces . i would recommend it . 
it 's a hole . 
they do with proglonged high heat so i use potholder mitt . you can purchase protective heat proof slide on handle to place on handles & they work fine . great pans regardless . 
no 
i bought the new ones for $ 49.95 and absolutely love them ! best pans i 've ever had . also saw the same exact set at macy 's `` on sale '' for $ 99.99 
no just 2 
i measure 12 3 8 '' and 10 1 2 '' with the lid inverted . 
calphalon unison pieces are clearly marked toledo , ohio but this specific contemporary one has no markings , so i assume it is not completely made in the usa . it could be because of the different product lines . 
hello , as confirmed with calphalon the diameter at the bottom of the pot is 10.2 wide . thanks ! buyhappier 
this one is the best is excelent 
yes 
i have n't encountered this problem . every time i 've used this there has been no lid sputtering and definitely no explosion . 
you can leave it inside , but it might decrease the steamer 's `` life `` . it kind of changed color a little , and i only used it for steaming veggies and some fruit . i think you can use the bigger insert , the one for pasta ( looks more sturdy ) and boil your hot dogs . 
this is an aluminum pan . this will not work on induction , sorry . 
thank you for your question . this oven is round in shape . thank you ! buyhappier 
yes , i also have ceramic top range and have absolutely no problems . i truly love this cookware . even cooking and easy clean-up . 
11 3 8 '' diameter , 15 '' from handle tip to handle tip , and 4 '' tall . 
11-1 2 x 4 tall and 5 qt . i love it . i have the 8 qt that 's much deeper for soups and stews . i was a leery that it would be too shallow but it is perfect for on top of stove and the oven for other things . 
yes . the lid is made from tempered glass and can withstand 500 we use this one at least 4 times a week ! 
yes , but i 'd depends on the quantity 
18 '' x 18 '' 
just the case . it is zippered and fit easily over an existing pillow i had . it is really cute and worth the price . i love mine . 
i really do n't know . they are nicely made and the fabric is rather thick . i would guess they could be hand washed or washed in the gentle cycle . i would line-dry them & not risk throwing them in the dryer . 
not in my opinion ... fabric is thin , not much texture . 
$ 6.96 is the cushion cover 's price and $ 10.95 is the total price including freight .

we appreciate your interest in our stainless steel chopsticks . these are made of quality 18 8 food-safe stainless steel , they are not solid as that would made them too heavy to hold . they are quality products of china . just in case you are wondering , there are no lead , no bpa , nor mercury . also , no child labor , no prison labor nor any forced labor used in the production or processing of the product . 
slightly squared . nice feel . 
they need to go in the rack business-end up , and even then they might fall through , depending on the rack design . other then that , no problem . does n't effect the finish at all . 
there are two pouches , and the chopsticks are packaged two sets to a pouch . each set came individually wrapped in tissue to prevent scratching in transit . the bag itself is n't very luxe -- it seems like nylon or a similar material -- but the material does seem sturdy and durable . 
yes , it 's stainless steel . 
pitcher is made in china , interior markings done in the us . 
the pitcher is 3 3 4 inches tall , 2 3 4 inches in diameter at the top and 3 inches in diameter at the bottom . very nice quality . love the measuring marks inside . 
yes , the markings are safe at any temperature . 
i purchased mine about 3 mo . ago . i use it daily for frothing milk and i hand wash it daily . it gets to temperatures over 150 deg . daily . the markings are as clear as new . therefore i do n't suspect any residue or toxic issues . 
thank you for your interest . national etching expects to have a 20 oz . version available soon .

well i never saw moths in my case , only holey sweaters . i do n't have holey sweaters any more . plus it 's a proven fact that cedar repels moths . here , have some martha stewart musings on the subject ... http : www.marthastewart.com 264609 the-basics-of-mothproofing 
they are 6 7 16 x 1 13 16 x 7 16 inches plus the hook , which is about 2 1 2 inches . you will have to sand them to really release the cedar scent . 
the boards are 10 cm ( height ) by 3 m ( width ) and 1 cm ( depth ) with a hook on top to hang them 
they last at least 4-5 seasons or more for me ; if you place them carefully where the cedar can properly protect clothing , towels , sheets , etc. , you should have no problem with them lasting an extremely long time . as long as you continue to smell the cedar , the protection will always be there . 
i did not put them in direct contact with items i felt might show oil spots . i also wrapped some in tissue cloth just in case 
what i did is screw in the hangers to the flat pieces with a small hole and hung those in my closet . the round pieces with the larger hole i used over a hanger . they can go in the closet or if you have something in a zipped clothes bag . the sachets are nice in a drawer mixed in with wool items . i had a stuffed animal made of wool and i drilled a hole in one of the small square ones and put it around the toy 's neck with a ribbon . the small squares can go in with hats in a hat box or in drawers or cabinets where wool items are kept . i hope these suggestions are helpful . 
david , i am here to tell you they are competely non toxic it is really a good product and is does the job well 
i think they do . they also seem to be controlling the `` pests '' . it 's that time of year in nd and i have n't heard near as much complaints coming from the kids as their rooms are in the basement . 
yes 
these usually are used for moths . not sure how effective against the others , but closets , cabinets , attics , crawl spaces , hidden areas ( under sinks ) . for rodents i use pure peppermint oil in a sprayer with bottled water , the spray where mice are present ( attics , dark , hidden areas ) . plus then it makes the house smell nice . 
absolutely ! serated knives are my favorite as they are more versatile . i honestly did n't think you could sharpen a serated edge until i gave it a try with my perfect edge sharpener , it worked ! i would definitely recommend this sharpener for serated edges , you will be glad you did ! 
no i am sorry it can not . 
harry . i do n't have a santoku knife . it 's my understanding they are a composite steel with a blade design to release food . it will sharpen the steel i 'm sure but could alter the blade design . i have a hedge cutter blade i could never get sharp . and it worked great on it . djw 
use it frequently . it is not a handle for turning , it is a lever for a pumping action , which has a nice solid feeling and works well . ended up looking for this particular model after using it at a friend 's house and being impressed with the construction , quality , feel and action of the device . 
size capacity is approximately four quarts . hope this helps you out ! 
sorry ... i tried to find out the same information and could not get an answer . 
in fact , it is ! i had long since thrown away whatever documents it came with . however , if you go to the product page on 
charger , wall hanger bracket , long rude , floor cleaning head , animal upholstery head , wand ( crevice tool ) , small head with retractable brush . it 's complete . 
1. motoruzed head with carbon fiber filaments 2. mini motoruzed head 3. crevice tool 4. combination assesory tool 5. extension pole 6. charger and charger stand for hanging 
you have to hold the switch . i think this is the 'perfect ' vacuum except it needs a way to lock it on . 
yes it is good on hardwood floors . that is what i have in my house . 
this is the best for the stairs ! it has 2 rotating brush extensions for either wide or shallow stairs , or your preference . easily detaches , easily connects.. it is light enough in weight , that it will be fairly effortless to go up or done the stairs , doing carpet or hard flooring material . lastly , it gets good and close on the edges next to the wall or the next step , however your stairs are arranged . i think you will be pleased , i have been ! have fun , mark 
the battery is made of nickel , manganese , cobalt li-ion . it is the earlier one . the dc59 has the new battery . 
stronger suction and it picks up hair like no other vaccume i have . for frequent shredders it 's a must have . 
6 '' x12 '' x31 '' 
i have used it on a low pile carpet and it does work well , however , it will bog down on other thicker carpets and the beater bar will not work . great on hardwood floors . hope this helps . 
full recharge takes about 5-6 hours , if that is what you are referring to in your question . 
yes they do , plus no more neck pain . 
paula , i just bought them . to make up a guest bed for family visiting for christmas , so they are far from needing cleening . no head has hit them yet . but you can put them in washer delicate speed and put in dryer . 
hello kriscpa , this pillow does not have a thread count . the shell is a 50 % cotton 50 % polyester mix . 
hello ramin , yes this pillow is 95 % feather and 5 % down . 
i aired them out and did n't notice an odor . they are horrible pillows though ... .do n't waste your money . 
400 tc do n't know the fabric type , but pillow case is easy to slip on 
the started soft . now are completely flat 
they are medium fill , but in my experience the feathers inside have a tendancy to push out and cause the pillow to be uncomfortable . cheers . 
no , they do not have a bad smell at all . 
hello , these pillows have a medium firmness to them . 
it is heavy and hard . i returned mind because they were so hard and did not fluff up . 
i sleep on my side and these work fine . 
i have no idea what they use but i cant smell anything on my pillows ... i would guess that the company who sells them would have all that enfo . for you thats my guess ... sorry 
no . they are made with hard carbon steel covered by a non-stick coating . i have had these knives for over six months and i cook a lot . these are my favorite knives of all time ! ! ! 
i 've had one of these knives for about a year without it chipping off . they are made really well . i did attempt to use one of them to chip through some frozen solid spinach one time and the coating did slightly chip . i do n't know what it 's made of but they work and do n't rust 
i do n't know . i gave them as a gift . i have another brand that i use daily and have n't had to sharpen them yet . 
sorry ... do n't know , but i love , love , love them ! 
ca n't you guess ? china , of course , is n't everything ? i 've had no problems with it . 
it takes about 10 mins from cold to roaring boil . 
yes , it writes on the case . 
i believe this one is 1500 - a slow boiler . : - ) everything under 1kw would be rather slow to bring water to boil . 
slowly 
there is a short cord attached to the base station . the kettle itself is cordless . 
no you ca n't 
it will touch the window which is a plastic part . 
china , like everything else i guess . had it for 6 months no complaints 
the kettle does not have a keep warm feature but it has an automatic shut off function that turns off the kettle once it comes to a full boil . 
hi since there is no website to register maybe you can contact amazon and the will have more information 
no , it 's plastic . i love it ! 
i do n't see why you could n't but are you aware that a lot of teas should never be put into boiling water ? a lot of teas actually are recommended to be done at lower temperatures . i 'm not trying to solicit but i am part of a company that does sell loose leaf tea and there is a tea app if you have an apple or android cell phone that you can download for free . go to your app store and look up tealightful it has a lot of great information about all types of tea . 
i got this product like 2 months already and so far it did not rust yet . 
do not know for sure , but it is stainless steel with a plastic window . 
it is stainless steel the only plastic on it is the little window and the handle . it is a hard plastic of a type that i would not think had bpa . 
it 's fast ! ! ! 
through the base that has a wire ... the kettle sits on the base and and gets power through the contacts . 
the inside bottom of the kettle is metal where the heating coil is and the rest is plastic . 
yes , this one automatically shuts off when it reaches a boil . no other option , it could not be on after boiling . 
once the water boils , the beating element shuts off . you could cook eggs by leaving them in the hot water . 
honestly it might be a bit much for her depending on her strength . if she is able to lift pots and pans out of the cupboard she should be ok with this . it is a bit bulky ( about as big around as a rubbermaid gallon pitcher on the bottom and about half as high , though it tapers ) . it is a bit heavy when filled all the way . not so bad if halfway . 
nope . works great . 
its only setting is on or off . it is designed to boil water and turn off . 
china 
it do n't take too long to warm up , an 5 mins not that long for a pot of cold water to get hot , try again or just exchange it if ur not happy 
there is a base that kettle actually sits on and the base has the electrical cord . i love it . 
no , it is not very loud , it makes noise , but just regular boiling noise , nothing out of the ordinary . 
just tested for you . a full 1.5l water bring to boil and stop it takes 7 minutes and 50 second on my kettle . 
i called in ovente and they said that it is bpa free . 
yes , the kettle is very easy to clean - just rinse it out if needed ( we are just boiling water in it ) . the only problem after months of use and many pots of water per day at the office , there were some mineral deposits on the bottom of the glass kettle where the heating element is - small round dots along the outer edge . all i needed to do was swish some clr around in the bottom of the kettle and the mineral deposits came right out . 
this was hard to tell because the black plastic covers the bottom outside so you ca n't tell visually . but i drained it and felt around inside ( there are some odd ridges and bumps ) and it all felt like glass . hope this helps . 
no 
i think that you probably could but i 'd send an email to the manufacturer to be sure . 
according to the information on the bottom of the box , they are made in china . 
yup . it sits on a circular base . connects and disconnects very smoothly . its a little slow to boil though . that 's the only bad thing i could say about it though . 
made in china designed in italy 
on the bottom it says `` made in china . '' 
yes 
yes , the very bottom is metal 
we have had ours for a couple of months now . we like it very much - never had the problem that you are talking about . like anything new , it is a good idea to use it a few times by heating it up and throwing away the water . the only thing about it is that it is a bit slower to heat up than our previous kettle . we discovered the reason is that the heating element is sealed below . one could actually brew tea in this model - looks like it would be easy to clean because of the design . 
not cordless . 
no . you just hear the water boiling sound . and it just quietly , automatically turns off when the water is ready . 
according to the box it came , yes . 
yes . it is mostly plastic . 
i believe they only recommend heating the water as you are not supposed to submerge it to wash it . i would n't brew tea in it but it would be nice to be able do that and reheat your tea ... 
i did not notice the bottom plate heating but did notice the bottom sides of the kettle heating up , but not to the point of being dangerous to touch . 
no , the heating element is actually inside the carafe and can not easily be touched . 
i bought two packages of the silver ones . one was not enough . i think each package had 24. ibhad about 8 to ten left over . 
you will need 3 packages of 12. i can not remember exactly but i believe it used 32 or 34 . 
it hangs freely and has metal weights on the hem . sometimes it might have to be adjusted but the vinyl is pliable . very little odor . i am allergic to such toxins that come from vinyl and am happy to report i hardly noticed an odor . most importantly - no leaks in the basement . we had water leaking when using 2 or 3 other shower curtains around the clawfoot tub in our house . we are very happy to take showers now . the price was worth it . 
after mine hugh for a week or two the folds all came out . 
it will go all the way around the tub ... . this is a great deal and a great product ... 
if you are referring to putting into a washer , then no . if you are referring to spraying on windex and scrubbing it , then yes . 
no it does not come with hooks but it is a nice curtain durable . 
it 's not completely see-through . but it is mostly `` clear '' and let 's a lot of light filter through . the best word i can use to describe it is cloudy or foggy . 
you will need 36 hooks and open hooks over the rod will work best . 
the one i have is a standard shower curtain height but is 180 inches wide . 
my hem is fused , not sewn . no mildew problems yet , but the curtain 's only been in use for 4 months . 
a bunch - 32 : ) 
about this item extra wide shower curtain for a clawfoot tub opaque with magnets approximately 180 '' wide 70 '' long extra wide to keep the water and heat in opaque in color to let the light in can be used as a liner or the curtain itself 33 stainless grommets 
the shower curtain is a heavy duty vinyl that is a little stiff . it does not move very easily . i 'm hoping it will `` soften '' in time . 
there is no trick i am so upset with this item i just want to chuck it in trash but my sister bought one first and hers is on steriodes or something and she has no problems and if we put both machines side by side there is only one diffrence hers works and mine does not . the cotton candy machine does not work either . sorry your luck is as bad as mine . janet 
the blades are metal it also comes with a replacement 
do n't waste your money this is a pice of junk . the machine does not shave ice . it has a common razor blade in the top and if you use one ice cube or even small ice chip it wont cut nothing . it just a colorful piece of junk 
in the top it holds about 2-3 cups of ice cubes . it shaves down pretty quick . 
hi , i bought one , i live in the uk , you have to buy an adaptor that converts to to 240v from amazon . john 
this is a piece of junk , do n't wasteal your money ... .it wo n't shave ice at all 
try to call nostalgia electric 
4ft 
yes , it is not battery powered . it must be plugged into a wall outlet in order to work . 
hi mario , thanks for your interest . it really depends on if you are shipping standard , ground , express and where the shipment is going . we normally try to ship within a day . i hope this answers your concerns . thanks for you interest . 
thank you for your inquiry . the assembled dimensions are 34.5 x 11.88 x 12in ( lxwxh ) . 
just right to hold the bottles ! ! ! can not measure since not at home but i bought two of these several months ago and have been most pleased . 
only 750ml normal size when you stack the racks . if only using one rack maybe . 
it is 12 inches , great item . i bought 2 sets and right now have 30 bottles on it , and it is very sturdy . 
yes you can 
i have four high and it seems to be rock solid . the weight of the bottles actually makes it more stable . 
yes ! i actually did the exact same thing and it worked great ! 
no , this fits standard to 750ml wine bottles . 
they are normal bat towel size ; 27 '' x 53 '' . they are just the right size for me and my husband . they are also the right thickness for us ; not too thin but also not so thick that i ca n't wrap my hair in them . washed them several times and so far they have held up well and continue to be soft and fluffy . 
54 x 27 x 0.5 inches , they are very nice towels . you 'll need to wash them once first to get all the excess lint out of them . after that i 've had zero problems . 
i do . ca n't imagine having white towels and not bleaching them , although i do think they say do not bleach . 
they are white . 
hi amalia our towels ( sold only by owl towel ) are 54 x 27 x 0.5 inches 
hi angela , thanks for asking - yes we do offer both hand towels and wash cloths but they are both currently out of stock . replacements are on the way to amazon though . thanks for asking ! 
hi c. , thanks for asking . we are new to amazon but to the best of my knowledge the last review ( 4 stars ) from ronald richman is . the others are from purchasers from our retail operation - we are asking every customer to give us reviews . hope that helps . 
there is plenty of space for those items . the main concern with these drawers is how much weight hey can hold ( not much ) . it 's a very light weight piece of furniture but i think it would be great for underwear and light clothing . 
it 's pretty tall to be a nightstand . it 's not the most stable item either . i would advise against using it as such . 
yes , i 've contemplated using it for just that . but i use it for the babies clothing until he gets bigger and has more . i then plan to use it for diapers , bibs , wipes , lotions , etc . 
about 3 ' tall 
it holds light desk items for my daughter at school . it does n't appear to be able to hold very much in my opinion just very cute ! 
yes you can . the legs are angled to the back 
i do n't know the exactly weight but it 's pretty sturdy . i 've had it for 3months and that has never been a concern for me . 
it 's attached and it is very rounded in back corner 
19 '' 
the package arrived with an open and damaged light weight box and the table inside was bent inside because the box was n't fit to ship the table . i sent damaged table back and did not re-order . 
there is no filter . it is an atomizer which sprays fine vapor mist upward into the air which evaporates quickly . actually has no actual user-accessible moving parts . ideal for a room or small apartment , not for a home ( 1,250 square feet or more ) . 
i have two of them . works fine on carpet or hard wood . never had a problem . 
i dont think so when the power button is on ... it 's a nice blue light ... good luck 
instructions are with my lady but i recall some of it . one , if you are using distilled water only , you wo n't need to clean it . if you are using tap water , then you will need to clean it if your water is hard water , leaves a white calcium lime residue . city water is usually pretty hard . i think that you only need to wipe it with a clean rag where you see this mineral buildup occur . no solutions or solvents . 
cartridge supost to take out minerals from the water . you can by it on amazon or sharper image website . but if your water is good you do n't need to use it and in my opinion i do n't think that those cartridges are helping at all . 
ca n't directly answer your question but will say that we have had our unit for several months and always use distilled water . it 's a little expensive but we have n't any dust ! 3rd 
i have the shark rocket and i like that it has the cord so that i can vacuum as long as i want to . my in laws have the dyson dc44 which they really enjoy ; however , it does need recharged after about 15 minutes of use . it really depends on what you are going to be using it for . if it is just quick pick-ups for short amounts of time that may work for you . i prefer the shark rocket . 
yes , very well . and so much easier then a broom or even a swifter . 
monika , yes you can definitely use it as a short handheld vacuum ! it is modular in design . just the power sweeper , the extension pipe , and the power head canister . just plug the power head canister directly into the power sweeper and you are good to go ! by the way ... after you unpack all the components from the shipping carton , it takes about 5 minutes to put together and you are ready to vacuum . i am physically challenged and i use the vacuum the way i described and i can vacuum my carpets from a motorized chair with no problem . i did contact shark and made a suggestion to make a shorter extension to go between the power sweeper head and the power head canister to make it easier to vacuum from a seated position . i hope this answers your question . i certainly like mine ! 
when i ordered mine directly from shark it came with a lot of different attachments . the detail kit , which i did n't get , is a lot of little tools for clean keyboards , car vents and other small places . if you go to the official shark site you can see all the attachments that are available . 
should be fine for anyone , less work than the hose dragging a canister vacuum behind your . 
this is not cordless but is a great vacuum . 
yes it does ... 
we have two cats and my wife love the shark . 
i 'm not sure . i registered the product and the manual states a 5 year limited warranty under normal use . 
yes it is easy to get under beds and couches . it lays flat and the handle is long . 
yes , and stays on as long as the door is open 
hxdxw = 12 3 4 '' x 16 '' x 21 3 4 '' 
from my experience you have to clear the timer first , but there may be a way ! 
no . the inside is painted white . 
no it 's white metal , i 've had this for several months and i am very happy with it , it works great gets food hot very quickly . hope i helped you in some way .

the griddle does not have any kind of special coating . it is a good quality stainless steel . there is a lot of hype you can find about `` vapor cooking '' . it seems to refer to simply cooking with little or no oil . the fact of the matter is that some things will stick and some will not . there is a reasonable conductive layer in the griddle that helps provide lateral conduction so that there are not `` hot-spots '' . this is probably the feature that allows the use of less oil since it allows a more uniformly hot surface without scorching in spots . i have had best luck making sure that the surface is fully up to cooking temperature before adding anything . i use this on an induction hob , so the stainless steal is necessary ( aluminum will not heat ) . it works well , but is not magic . with a small amount of oil , pancakes separate easily using a steel spatula , though not as easily as they release from my teflon-surfaced griddle on an electric hob . one advantage of the stainless steel is that it can be brought to a higher temperature than is safe with the teflon and used to sear meats , which subsequently release surprisingly well from the surface . the griddle cleans up nicely . i store mine with a very light coat of oil ( wipe on and then off with a dry paper towel ) and that seems to help performance some . 
i have this griddle , but no , i 've never seen it used on an induction cooktop . all i can say is it works perfectly on my traditional electric stove with coils . grilled cheese comes out perfect every time . pancakes work out equally as well . i can say the same for french toast . i love this griddle because there is no nonstick coating to come off and be in your food . 
i own a saladmaster griddle and bought this one for my daughter because she wanted one similar to mine . it seems to be very comparable and was a little cheaper . 
11 inch 
no ! this is apparently for gas-fired grill . it takes quite long to heat up . 
touch button to start , then touch button again to back up and release lid . very sharp edge on lid and can ! ! ! i 've quit using it because of dangerous edges . 
i did n't see warranty info on enclosed safety & use flyer so i emailed the company & here is their response : `` hello , the easican has a 2 year warranty . have a great day , cid : image005.jpg @ 01cfed23.25a23760 , anne marie steele , customer service , dkb household usa corp. , let 's connect on linkedin ! `` . have only had mine a couple of months but works just great so far . hope this helps you . 
approximately 5 '' x 3 '' . works terrific ! 
yes , it is easy to use and seems safer than other types , which require strength and skill . the opener requires the person to shut it off by using the same black button to turn it on before it will stop rotating . 
yes push button once to start push button to stop 
mine wo n't work either . new batteries also . 
top . the top just slides off . easy ! 
yes , you just put on top of can and press button , it opens the lid without any help . very good product . 
hi emma ! we 've only had the zyliss about a month so i ca n't tell you . they do provide the first battery . 
it leaves a sharp , wavy edge on the can . no sharp edge on the lid . 
for me , the greatest benefit is that is not made in china , so you do n't have to worry about toxic chemicals being used to make it . i also love being able to brown my meat on the stove top in the pot and then transfer it to the base- no extra to clean up . it 's easier to store because the pot goes in the cabinet with the rest of my pots and the base is so small that you can store it anywhere without taking up a lot of room . the pot is durable beauty and easy to clean . i have not found that it sticks more than the ceramic does . you do n't have to worry about it cracking like the ceramic slow cooker inserts can . you can also put it in the oven . the base is really plain and simple , but that 's what i like about it . i really love this set ! thanks for asking . 
it easily can hold a 2.5 pound roast . i am not sure it would cook meals for 4 people , though . if you have children who are not big eaters , it may work for you . it is a wonderful slow cooker , and we have thoroughly enjoyed it . however , there are two of us . it does a great job on the stovetop for browning and then slow cooking . 
sure , you can . i preheat the pot on medium heat and cook meat for a few minutes with the cover off to brown . 
absolutely ! but like the others said , do n't leave it on too high while out and about . i often leave it on for 24-48hrs on low if i am making bone broth or really deep flavoured sauces . never had an issue at all ! 
yeah i use the base to keep my stainless steel wok pan warm . 
my guess is during the cooking process , the heat was set higher then the lid was placed on and the temp reduced . that will create a vacuum ( same thing happens with other 360 cookware if you leave the lid on and turn heat off ) . simple fix ! turn the heat up a bit and in a minute the lid comes right off - no probs ! 
i would not leave it on overnight . 
yes . i usually put it on induction cooker to boil , then vaporseal it and transfer to the cookware 360 cooker . induction cookers are not good for slow cooking as they turn on and off instead of continuously heating , breaking the vapor seal . 
this one ( 4 quart ) comes with the base . the review of the 2.3 quart was probably an error caused by the manufacturer . 
no it does n't have a timer as it is an awesome but independent 4 qt pot that can be also used as a slow cooker when placed into the base . the pot is multilayered and can be used to cook anything on the stovetop or in the oven . thick and gooey food clean up so easily in 360 cookware , just by adding a bit of water and heating it . these are my favorite pots . this one happens to have a slow cooker base . 
no you need to use an adapter 
the base has rubber feet , no inner rubber seal . the seal should be in the blade lid . 
no . as far as i no 
absolutely not 
yes it does . 
not sure your exact question yes the cups are the same however this is just the base no blades or cups so yes you could use the cups for the 900 on this 
yes , it just wont be as powerful 
better for grinding up the harder stuff like nuts , carrots or frozen fruit . 
it is just the base . you need the blades as well as the cup . 
the leaf stitching is all brown . 
more like a faded black , i think . 
yes ! as a matter of fact i just washed them this weekend for the first time . i line dried , all looks good . these pillow are beautiful ! do not be afraid to order , you will not regret it . 
the estimated dated is defaulted by amazon , we can not change it , you items will arrive at you in 8-14 days , thanks . jastore 
it is , but it 's not my favorite . i 've gotten used to it for napping , but it 's actually a pretty rough material . i 'd suggest a different one . 
i do n't know the answer to that question . i would encourage you to look at the specs on the pot that came with your unit . 
thanks for posting , according to the product description , this glass carafe fits models bco320t bco330t . i hope this helps ! 
no not correctly . 
yes 10 cup 
thanks for your question , according to the product details , this carafe fits models bco320t bco330t . i hope this helps you determine if it will fit your model or not . 
the guarantee of a factory refurbished item is the same as a new item . there is no change in guarantees between a factory refurbished item and a new item . 
yes . you can shut off the grind function on the front panel . 
it is just over 14 '' high . so it will fit under the upper cabinets assuming your cabs are the normal 18 '' + - above the counter . you will need to pull it forward to open the top and put water in , obviously . 
refurbished unit do not come with a filter . you have to order it separate . 
yes 
$ 6.99 custom cake , and yes cupcake toppers with child 's picture . 
yes 
yes , there is a custom option , please purchase that option and then reply to this email and let me know the image you want.. 
it is pink , but if you want purple just send me a message . thank you . 
at least two weeks in advance . always keep image stores at room temperature , be sure to keep it in a sealed air thigh zip-lock bag inside the packing envelope out of any direct light , until ready to apply to cake . image shelf life is 12 months . 
yes , use the custom cake link please 
sir , i 'm not sure unless a full size has a different supply & demand pricing to it . i paid $ 215 last june 2014 for the simple life fold in half solid flat foundation , which is just what i needed with the ultimate dreams memory foam mattress i paid $ 730 for a queen mattress for the ultimate dreams brand mattress & it went down now by $ 90 just since last june 2014. i see where a twin also cost more then a queen in price with the simple life foundation . perhaps someone that works there can answer your question better . i very much love my ultimate dreams mattress . it took me a while before settling for a great mattress after 2 months of researching & comparing memory foam . its just perfect comfort for me.take care 
greg yes it will . my son bed frame is left to right 
i 'm not sure what you mean by that . this is a great product , i highly recoment it . 
yes it is it is well built 
just the foundation . you to to buy bed frame separately 
no it does n't ... 
has been great for us . had this for almost a year and have no complaints . we have a memory foam mattress on top and have had no problems with noise . very solid and sturdy . i 'm a bigger guy and had problems with wood box springs breaking after awhile . this has held up nicely . 
yes , this will work well with a foam mattress , i bought this in combination with a sleep innovations 12 inch memory foam mattress and there is no support issue , the supports are not slats , but more of a grid pattern that leaves no room for sagging . 
possibly with super glue 
i bought the queen size so i ca n't answer for certain , but i ca n't imagine why they would not have it as one large box spring as it folds down to such a small item and the convenience is based entirely on being able to unfold it out into a full box spring in one piece . 
i do not know as our mattress covers that part now . i can say my husband is 6ft 4 in and weighs 296 lbs , he has no problems with this at all . we are very satisfied . 
yes , it folds in half in the middle . that 's how you will receive it when it arrives . so it wo n't be as long as a standard box spring but the width will be the same and because it 's metal , remember there wo n't be any flexibility ( since you are trying to fit it through limited space ) . i hope this helps . 
just the foundation ... .does n't come w stand 
the measurement of the box is 60 '' wide by 79 '' long by 8 '' high . this is what my queen box measures . it is a perfect fit with the queen mattress . 
i 've owned this platform for about 4 months and can detect no impressions . definitely no cuts . over time logic tells me that some impressions will appear . the extent of these impressions may depend upon age , thickness , density and manufacturer . mine is a 10 inch , 10 yr plus temperpedic . 
not sure we did not take it off sorry 
the papers that came with box spring did not really have that info . what they did have was a manufacturer and a phone number ... .leggett & platt . then they have warranty info number of 800-888-3078. hope this helps . this box is easy to set up , very sturdy and well made . 
if you 're referring to a bed frame to place this box spring on , then no . it 's just the box spring . 
do n't bet on it being delivered at all . i ordered mine 6 days ago , and they just got around to telling me tonight that they were cancelling the order . supposedly was supposed to be delivered this week , or so they originally told me . very professional . 
this is n't exactly the same thing but sort of ... our toddler loves jumping on the bed and mattress springs and we have never heard any squeaking . i mean different weight and motion but sim ? 
this box foundation does come in queen size . however , it is not a mattress , it is just the foundation that you would place your mattress on top of . 
yes they are plastic , but not sure about bpa free , i 'd contact manufacturer for reassurance on that . it 's a really nice kit ! 
i use a soapy wet rag and then rinse the rag and make sure i get any suds left off . works well 
not sure what a sport blended bottle is , but if it is like an average protein shaker cup it will fit fine . the side bag area is quite large 
about 27 ounces . 
yes . 
was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price . i gave it as a gift , but i recall twas not as fragile as i thought . i would definitely purchase it again 
its not too big , probably about the diameter of a quarter . 
this is a very nice silicone tray , however , i was a little surprised at the size of the cavities . they are very small . i make wax melts with this tray . hope this helps . 
the item was shipped in a small padded envelope post marked from china . when i opened the envelope , it was not wrapped , just in the envelope . i still have the envelope . also , there is no lettering on the item stating `` made in china '' . hope this helps . 
i have never done that , i just use mine for making candy . but i do n't see why not , there are alot of different silicone pans ; - ) 
i own this mold they are close to the size of a quarter . better luck looking at mini ice cube trays for that size . 
i would say 5-6 inches in diameter and 2-3 inches high . it is small and very helpful . hope this is an answer . 
i purchased the etekcity professional 22lb 9310 model scale and it 's powered by two aaa batteries and has an auto shut off . no power cord . 
just put the object on the scale then turn it on . 
after re-reading the directions , the information on the box , there is no indication of a warranty of any kind . 
about 4.5 inch diameter . i use a plastic container to hold larger quantities and zero the scale with the container , works great ! 
takes 2 aaa comes with it . 
well put it on a sturdy flat surface . wobbly surfaces can cause subtle movement in the material being weighed , especially the surface plate . once it is still it should settle to zero if it does n't , then hit the tare action and that will re zero the scale . the directions should tell you on how to operate the tare function . 
with mine that 's exactly what i do . it automatically starts up each time set to ounces . this picture seems to be the 11 lb dks model . mine is the 11 lb 3252 model . i 'm speaking of my model only . both models , however , appear to have an 11 lb ( 5 kilogram ) weight max capacity . 
i have a glass top range ( normal electric ) and they work great . 
yes rachel , they can . what i do is light the burner and then turn it down some before placing the pot on the burner ; i 'm not sure whether that 's really necessary or not but i do it to keep the flame from discoloring the outside of the pan pot . i am assuming that your stove is the same as mine , i.e . you have to turn it to high for it to light . i actually bought this set for a rental unit but i would not hesitate to buy them for myself-they are very nice . hope this helped . 
no 
plastic 
no , same color as the pans and they say tfal 
us 
yes 
that information is available on a link on the page - its something like more information- or details just look around , you will find it 
various sizes but i thought that was given when you click on details . anyhow . i have not found a need for any pots of different sizes than what was included . 
no . they are not safe for induction cooking . you would need to get stainless steel or copper . 
they are flat , but the handles get very hot , which is not mentioned . 
i called t-fal and checked this out and yes it is made in china . according to the company the sets labeled elegance are induction ready pans . if it has copper bottom it can not be used induction wise . 
the sizes of the fry pans are 12 '' 10.5 '' and 8 '' 
as far as i remember , yes . 
the tops of the handles get warm , and the closer you move to the actual pan they tend to get pretty got . 
not at all . buy some barkeepers friend and they will stay clean . 
yes the lids fit the fry pans.. 
no it does not come in contact with food . the aluminum base is a separate piece on the bottom . 
this is a more popular color . otherwise , the models are the same . 
it comes from a single hole in the bottom . but it has no problem circulating the kernel 's 
no 
hi va mommy , this is actually the same model number it 's just a different color unit . 
this item is matte red . 
yes it does . i love this popper and it looks great too : ) 
no . this for make popcorn 
cuisinart does not recommend to roast coffee in the machine . 
yes , i 'm finding it better made , heavier and the motor is a lot stronger , i 'm not worried at all about it breaking . thought i 'd let you know , on all models not all the fruit goes through and there is quite of bit of waste left in the blades . i love this though ! try freezing cubes of soy milk or coconut butter in ice cube trays to add to the fruit . i use a lot of vanilla and cinnamon too . hope you enjoy it . 
i do n't know for certain , other than that this one was described as commercial somewhere . because it was a gift , i chose this one hoping it would have a stronger motor because i expected the recipient ( a teen ) to make multiple servings at a time for her and her girlfriends . until i bought this , she had been using my cuisinart hand blender , and that little machine was not up to the task . this yonanas elite is getting a lot of use , and i and my teen ( and my hand blender ) are delighted with the purchase . 
if you plan on using this magical machine more than just occasionally because you want healthy desserts without all the artificial additives , then the elite is the way to go . the regular machine does the job and makes yummy desserts . but ( there 's always a `` but '' ) its motor strains when the mostly frozen fruit is rammed through the shoot . that makes it a very noisy ( think ear-plug-worthy ) machine . it also shimmies and shakes when making the frozen goodies . it just feels as if it needs a rest after making just a couple of servings . the elite is a sturdier workhorse . its motor is up to the job , and so are all the components . it is a heavier machine and i do n't feel as if it is working hard when i make a big batch of something divine and healthy . and it is much more quiet . it still makes noise , but it 's possible to talk with someone standing next to you and hear them as you are making your dessert -- something not possible with the regular yonana . the unit does n't vibrate or strain -- it just turns large chunks of frozen bananas or fruit into creamy , yummy deliciousness . both machines are a breeze to wash and put back together . i think the right machine for you will come down to how much you think you will use it and your noise tolerance . 
almost every recipe in the booklet calls for bananas , but i use other fruits alone all the time . 
i add frozen blueberries , raspberries , and blackberries all the time , along with bananas . i thaw all of these for 15 minutes , and they get ground up . 
you can make as much or as little as you want ! i generally set up serving bowls and frozen fruit and make fruity combinations as requested ! because you control how much fruit you want to use for a serving , you can make as few or as many as you wish ! when i use it , i make 3 or 4 servings . our family loves this ! 
not at all . their recipe book includes recipes to make sorbet , which uses no bananas . i personally love strawberries and raspberries , and you can use them frozen to make sorbet , frozen pies , etc . 
much better built , stronger motor , does n't make as much noise , uses less plastic and more metal parts . 
a more powerful motor . therefore it works faster and with less pressure . 
250w 
the elites model . i have used both . the elite results in a much better texture so happy you are coming . sent from my iphone . 
you do n't have to use bananas - if you do n't it 's more like making a sorbet . bananas give it the creamy texture closer to ice cream , but you can you use basically whatever you want . i use it without bananas all the time . 
i have n't tried any of that , but i did look through the book , nothing was mentioned . when you use the fruit you need to let it set out for 12 min . to get to the right consistency , so i do n't think a liquid would work . they do use liquids to pour over it after its finished , like rum . i hope this helps , its really a great item . 
it sounds like a blender crunching frozen fruit when it 's running but it does n't take long for the fruit to go through . 
fruit is used as you would naturally eat them . the bananas are frozen without the peel . berries are frozen whole . pineapple without the shell , etc 
noise , one is louder than the other 
the recipe book has several recipes that include yogurt . i made several batches using yogurt and liked the creaminess and dairy flavor . the recipe book suggests using cubes of yogurt that has been frozen . i sometimes just mixed in refrigerated yogurt when i was ready to eat the dessert . i really prefer it with the yogurt . 
110 
no only 120v 60hz you will need a transformer for uk etc 
it has 2 drawers , they are nice and deep . they came assembled and packaged very nicely . i 'm very happy with them , they look expensive , nice piece of furniture . 
yes . we just had to screw the feet on . 
about 20 lbs . 
thank you for your interest in our product . the item that you are inquiry for has a dimension of 24l x 16w x 25.88h where the width 16inch is the whole product width . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
thank you for your interest in our product . unfortunately , we currently only carry the nightstand for this set . sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused . 
yes , this unit has a connection for a garden hose but no pump . 
from what i read , this model , namely dp2-70e-03 is not on the recall list . the ... ... -02 model may be depending on the date code . here is the information from gree to find out : http : www.greedehumidifierrecall.com productentry.aspx 
you can do both . if you connect a garden hose it will bypass the bucket . 
this is the new 2013 model with energy star . all other recall batches were made during the previous years . 
yes , if the humidistat works . mine did n't . 
i 'd say at least twice the size of the one you can get at target . one thing that 's also very nice is that it 's the height of a regular chair , not a lawn chair . i love it . 
black ! ! ! ! ! ! 
not really . but i 'd say 250 lbs max . 
no , it is not included . 
i do n't remember how much they cost - but they are great hangers for a front guest closet where heavy winter coats are hung widely apart . they are almost statement hangers - not for your own clothes closet where you want to cram things in efficiently . very pretty and solid and sturdy . oh - sorry - the ones i bought are black wooden ones - are these plastic ? 
it is an inch and a half and solid . works well for my husbands sports jacket . 
one 
2-5 business days . we also offer 2 days priority mail 
this is for a 1 4 sheet cake 8 x 10 thank you . 
the pillow is filled with shredded memory foam but the cover is made of bamboo fibers that are antibacterial & wo n't let any micro organisms grow . it 's hypo allergenic 
no , we have had ours almost a year , and no problems , i just fluff it before i crawl in bed . you will not be disappointed in these pillows ! we love ours ! we even take them in the camper with us because we sleep so good on them ! covers wash great too ! 
no my head does not fall into a sink hole when i place it on my pillow . i purchased this pillow because my neck and shoulders were hurting in the morning . my bamboo pillow helps me sleep more soundly . i now own 2 
i have had this pillow for about a year and it is like new . no lumps and i would said still firm . watch what size you get , queen is more firm then king i think . had to learn that one . 
if you order from seller `` bamboo bedding '' , i guarantee that they are authentic . 
i knead mine back into shape every morning when i make my bed . it takes about 15 seconds . 
no , they are not hot . 
never really had a bad smell . 
yes i still put a pillow case over top even though it has a cover but you would n't have to 
i just made the purchase . it was for my husband and he gave me his review . i have not yet tried to clean the pillow . 
3 '' x 3 '' cheers pete 
yes ... but you should replace the gaskets on each canning cycle ... . 
yes 
it is glass ... there is no such thing as bpa in glass ... only plastic and resins ... the gasket is bpa free 
i do n't know about `` scizzers '' , but i believe you could use scissors to cut the material . 
this liner is clear . 
my husband never wipes it down , he just tries to make sure any leftover shower soap is rinsed off . his last one lasted almost a year . 
no but the curtain is heavy and stays down great 
probably not , unless you can adjust the height of the bar that holds the curtain . 
if the grommets are falling outfit sounds like a manufacturing defect . if it 's the plastic circles inside the grommets that 's normal . we did not have . a problem withe the grommets falling out . 
brice - the picture you have here is not the product i purchased . i bought the `` saturday knight -the world peva shower curtain '' which is a special kind of cloth . the world shower curtain needs no liner as it is that cloth kind - it comes with 12 grommets and 12 plastic oval rings for hanging . made in china i was afraid to unwrap it for fear it would smell . no worries - it was installed it and it 's great . it replaced the former `` curtain '' and `` liner '' ! 
rough edge in . 
mine has 12 grommets . i did n't compare the measurements listed , but it fits my tub area nicely . 
12 ounces 
the latter big enough for dinner for sure ! 
i only ordered the 16 piece sets but when i searched , there were no other pieces available . 
yes . i just looked at the bottom of one of the plates and it does say made in china . however , they are very nice . 
eleven inches 
mine have not chipped so far but i have had them for only a few months . i had cups that chipped very easily in the past so i know what you mean . these do n't look or feel like those . they are very pretty so good luck if you decide to give them a try . bj 
my set of these dishes was made in china . i do n't know if the pfaltzgraff company is german or not , but i have old pfaltzgraff that was made in the usa . 
my dinner plates are 11 inches . 
i think it would work very well for you . inlay shows both in small version and in expanded version . inside drawer dimensions are 9 5 8 x 12 1 8. drawer opens to 6 3 4 with the remainder recessed . i think you 'd be happy with it -- a good idea . 
yes , this table has some matching chairs that are exactly the same finish and color : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djv53w2 http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djw7oza http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djwfdoo http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djynmrc http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djyuuzo http : www.amazon.com gp product b00dh4c3n8 also this small bistro table is from the same collection : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00dh7iaak hope this helps 
closed 35.5 '' wide , 25.5 '' deep . open 51 '' wide , 35.5 '' deep . hope this helps , it 's a beautiful table . 
i ordered this beautiful table after reading some of the reviews , a bit pricey but well worth it and yes it is very sturdy.. 
sorry , it only is available in this one color . it is a little red but not as red as it looks on the picture . let me know if you need more pictures 
there are no matching stools . there are matching chairs that are available , please let me know if you need links to them . 
we currently carry 6 chairs from the same factory to match the table but all have at least an upholstered seat cushion . 
front of the table has a 29.5 distance between the legs . at the side the distance is 18.25 '' hope that helps , edgar 
the color is a bit reddish although the finish is called chestnut . i think the 3rd picture gives it a true indication of what it would look like . hope this helps 
it did n't come with scissors or a sharpening steel . 
yes , we have two 8 '' chefs knives and a large sharpening steel in ours with plenty of room . i am really very happy with this item . it has a large capacity and it looks great . 
only the slot directly below . the next one down will take a 9.5 '' blade . 
about 3 inches 
7 8 '' 
the top 3 slots are 10 '' to 10.5 '' 
12 '' long yes . 
i am not sure , but thr quality is just not there . where the slits are it is very rough . 
they would as there are two slots that are 2 inches wide and one that is over 3 . 
no 
measure the height of your largest chef 's knife , mine is 21 2 inches . add about 3 4 inch ( that 's the height that the storage unit hold that part of the knife . if that is more than the clearance for your drawer , you ca n't put that knife in there . 
it is 16 1 2 inches long , and 6 inches wide . 
our drawers are 3 1 2 and the knives on the upper portion of the rack are right to the top of the drawer . 
just looked : there are small hexagonal nuts on each side ( not bolts ) , and they are inset so that you 'd need a tiny socket head to turn them . i 'd say they 're screwed onto a long pin with a little thread at each end . however , it is possible that the thread goes the whole length of the pin , in which case you 'd need to saw a length off in order to make the unit more narrow . oh , and the nuts are around 5 16 `` diameter . 
if the blade and handle exceed 16 inches in length , it will hang over the block . 
16.5 x 6 x 2 it 's written in the ad on the lower part of the website page . 
pot holders for the handles are needed , yes ; maybe moreso for gas flame than electric but better to be safe than sorry 
you only use one tier at a time on top of the base pan . when you want to steam , you use the pan with holes and place it on top of the base pan . when you want a double boiler for making sauces , you use the pan without holes over the base and leave the tier with holes off . not designed to use all three tiers at once . 
about 1 2 of that at the most . 
no this is not for induction cooking 
yes 
it is 8 '' 
yes 
it 's an 8 '' lid . 
fit all . they are same . 
china . 
sorry , i have no idea 
no - you pump the knob on the cover about 10 - 20 times and then after a day you pump more because it does not hold the vacuum . 
depends on what you put in the container.. i.e . if fruit , there will be drops of moisture if in for a period of time . that has been my experience 
there are 4 containers . 2-32oz and 2-16oz with lids ... .i hope this helps 
do yourself a favor and do n't buy these . they will not hold the vacuum seal which is the whole reason i bought them . cuisinart wanted me to pay to send them back with $ 7 so they could send me more of these . what pitiful customer service . they are junk . please do not buy them . 
it worked well on my tile floors , and my dog is an ultra shedder . 
it 's on the handle , just where you would logically touch it with your thumb . very convenient ! 
i have two siberian huskies . this vacuum removes more hair than anything else i 've ever used . the attachments are the only things that have ever worked to get their hair out of my car 's carpet . there are several models of hoover windtunnel pet vacuums . the cheaper ones suck ( or rather , do n't suck hard enough ) , this model is the good one . i 've never been excited about a vacuum before , but thanks to this , i may finally be able to wear dark clothes again . 
i have n't had that happen yet as i have n't had it very long . 
remove the canister from the vacuum like you are going to empty it . then on the front of the canister the hoover logo is a clip , lift it slightly ( pull away ) and the top part pivots up . under that is the filter . you can now clean the whole canister and wash the filter . be sure squeeze out as much water as you can and then let it sit on its side for about a day before you re-install it . you can find this on page 11 of the product manual which you can download here : http : hoover.com file 581 if you do n't already have it . 
our bed is rather low , so it does not fit under it . however , our beds in the spare bedroom are higher , and it fits under those . 
yes and great suction . 
it does need to be emptied after every use , but its really simple to do . 
i cant believe the pet hair it picks up -- i have three cats and two are short hair and my carpet and furniture looks great after using my new vacuum . 
on carpet it is a little noisier than my last vaccuum ( which was n't a hoover ) but it is n't terrible . the vaccuum works so incredibly well that i 'm ok with the noise , but again it is n't substantially noisier than any other vaccuum i have used . the one situation where this vaccuum is very noisy , is when you vaccuum bare floor with the rollers . if you click off the rollers ( with a simple foot press ) and use suction only on the bare floor , that makes the noise drop significantly . i use suction only on my bare floors and it picks up everything . hope this helps . 
for an accurate answer , you would need to direct your question to the manufacturer . 
24 inches at widest point with wheels turned out , making the footprint slightly larger than wheels turned in . 
it is only available in 1 color : black . thank you , customer service 
the height ranges from 17 '' to 24 '' in height with a seat diameter of 15 '' . 
that 's funny , nope . stainless inside except for the plastic spout etc . 
i do n't know but my recommendation is dont buy ! ! ! the kettle failed after four months - it did not switch off and boiled dry to the point of melting the plastic base . more than four months after contacting the seller we are still waiting for a refund . 
kettle has preset options for green tea ( 175 deg f ) , white tea ( 185 deg f ) , oolong tea ( 195 deg f ) , french press coffee ( 200 deg f ) , and black tea , herbal tea , instant oatmeal , and instant noodles ( 212 deg f ) . 
made in china . 
yes , it can used to heat sak , but ... you would have to monitor the temperature as it warms . the lowest set-temperature on this model is 175f . warm sak should be drank at about 110f to 120f so if you allow it to reach the set temperature of 175f - 212f not only might someone burn themselves drinking it too quickly but you 'll also ruin the flavor and the potency of the sak . the best way would be to use it as a double boiler by pouring the sak into a sak server and placing it into the hot water . just make sure that the water level is not too high so that it may be too difficult to retrieve or that some water might get into the sak . if you do pour your sak directly into the kettle make sure to clean it out well afterwards as there will be some residue in the kettle that could scorch and give an off flavor to your next cup of tea ! 
the kettle does beep when temperatures are reached . i have not seen a celsius setting while using this product . 
it 's 120v and 1500w . 
hello vanda , it is very quiet . but does beep once boiled . it has a useful keep warm function and heats water to 4 different temperatures . i have not read the instructions so have no idea if the beeps can be disactivated 
well , there 's no setting for 205. it 's 200 , then 212. but tap water ( 84 in se texas summer ) to boiling took just under 6 minutes . the light show makes watching a pot boil pass quicker . ; ) 
no 
yes . that 's what i use them for and i store in the freezer also . 
3 1 8 '' high , 2 1 2 '' opening ( from william-sonoma website ) 
these jars are marketed as canning jars , so they should be able to withstand extreme heat . i do not think you could use them from frozen to heat without thawing first , but i think freezing should be ok too . just be careful of the temperature transition . 
hello suzanne . unfortunately , the weck jars are not tested for oven safe . we do not recommend using the weck jars in the oven . they are wonderful for canning and putting all your spices and coffee and ingredients in as well as fun and creative crafts . hope this helps and answers your question . liquid emporium 
this is one 7.5 '' image for your 8 '' or 1 4 sheet cake . 
yes ! i ordered it a month before my daughters birthday last year . you have to keep it at room temperature . before using it just put it in fridge for 10 min the edible layer pop up to be taken off and ready to put on the cake . 
yes . no problem . 
either n 8 '' round cake or a 1 4 sheet cake 
yes , you may submit another design and the seller would tell you if it would work . blue icing is hard to tell as white buttercream frosting works best . you may order up to 4 months before the event , but the closer to the date the better as it is more fresh . these will last as long as they are stored in the original zip lock bag on a dry , cool , dry shelf .

you will need to contact the seller via message , go into your orders and click on this order then contact seller .

yes 
i have no idea ... sorry . 
the actual weight is 2.13 lbs . and the shipping charge is $ 14.49 . 
yes , the water collect in the bottom clear tray . it is a standard light bulbs . this is an electric fountain . it will turn on if there is an electric power . 
sorry the package was thrown away . i 'm not able to measure it 
i do n't know because mind stop too . 
yes 
i would not -- juice pulp would clog . can not use champagne because bubbles air carbonation interrupt the flow . only water would be my suggestion . 
yes it does . its a great buy and it has an on off switch if you would preffer the lights off . 
not without making a mess ( at least in my experience ) . but there is a get-around to this problem . put your liquids in a regular freezer bag container and freeze it . then take the frozen liquid out of the regular freezer container and you can vacuum seal the frozen solid liquids with no problem ( and no mess ) . 
the one i purchased was only for 110 volt , you will need to contact manufacture to see if they have one that runs on 220v . 
it does not , but you can still use them and cut them to size without having the roll `` stored '' in the machine . 
yes , i called ! ! ! place 2 of the flat lids on till sealed then remove the top one and you will have a tight seal . i wanted it for that reason , and was down to the last ok to buy it she i saw your question and the answers you were getting . i stopped right there , and called . i have bought mine . 
since the peaches are frozen there should be no moisture so it is not necessary to use the moist setting , however you are not hurting anything by using that setting . 
i heat seal bags all the time ... especially chips pretzels , etc . it 's easy and i find my chips stay fresh much longer . hope this answer helps you . 
11-7 16 is the size that came with my foodsaver and it is so tight that you can hardly get it in the slot for it . if you can buy 11-1 4 bags they would be easier to deal with . 
amazon sells them http : www.amazon.com foodsaver-t03-0024-02-3-pack-bottle-stoppers dp b0000cfph9 and the food saver bags come in 11 '' wide rolls on amazon too ... ... http : www.amazon.com foodsaver-fsfsbf0616-000-11-roll dp b00005otxu 
i find softer things like breads often get squashed , unless you hit the seal button as soon as it 's drawn just enough vacuum . it is n't as hard a vacuum , so it does n't preserve as long . 
depends a lot on packaging . if dry food and hard like spaghetti small holes can be poked in the bags . also meat with bones . 
yes 
the wire basket measures 5 3 4 in diameter x 7 3 4 in height . there are little feet on the bottom that add another 1 4 '' to the height . the outside pan is 8 3 4 in height x 6 1 8 `` in diameter . handles extend 2 '' each , from opposite sides . hope this gives you what you wanted to know . s . 
yes , it 's stainless , and i like it . but i do wish it was a little smaller . i do n't cook huge amounts , and the smaller bunches seem to want to fall over i should 've paid attention to the size description ! 
no ! the mesh holes of the basket are way too big for spaghetti . you might be able to use it for rigatoni or other large pasta shapes , but not long , thin noodles . for reference , the holes in the mesh are approximately 1cm wide , and a spaghetti noodle is probably only 2mm wide . 
awesome , love it , 
the part that will touch the stove is about 5 1 2 inches in diameter ( across the middle ) 
i prefer to put corn with husk still on into microwave rather than boil all the flavor out of it , so i would never use this to cook corn and i found it not very successful for cooking asparagus which is why i purchased it in the first place . i have donated this item to the thrift store . 
it is true . very nice value and functional . we blanch veggies , steam crab legs , etc . in addition to asparagus . it 's a nice additional to your cookware . sharon 
manufactured in china yes . 
send me a magnet and i 'll try it . 
me and my wife just bought two sets , they are both pearl white bright white . none were grey or cream . 
stoneware , with a porcelain coating . very durable , we have had them for almost a year and absolutely no chips or cracks ! 
there around a medium weight , they seem to hold up very well , we have a soapstone counter top and with the kids setting them down hard have not broke any yet , very pleased with them 
no 
i called the company . no , they are not made in the u.s.a. and yes , china does produce these dishes . i chose them because i thought that they were not made in china . i love the set , however , my husband complains that the coffee mug always has a drip line of coffee . if shopping for square dishes watch out , some do not stack well in the dishwasher . these , just make it . 
the 6 1 2 '' bowl is 3 '' deep at the corners . the plate is about 1 1 2 '' deep at the corners . they fit in a dishwasher , but take up more space than more shallow dishware . i prefer the deeper bowls for soup ; they seem to keep the food hot longer . there are just two of us in the household , so i often wash by hand , although it is n't necessary . 
no more than any other dish one would put in the microwave . 
i do n't have a scale for small weights , but the plates are substantial . i 'm 70 and in pretty good shape , and find them manageable . btw , i like this set very much ! 
yes 
it should accept most plastic and stainless straws , and some smaller diameter glass straws ! 
no , as long as you keep it upright . the hole at the top does n't have a closure . 
yes 
# 5 
one ! it 's awesome . 
unfortunately it does n't display the dimension . i 'm certain the wide mouth lid will not fit on a regular sized mason jar . see regular sized cuppow lids cuppow.com 
i think it just means the opening is compatible with straws . mine did not come with a straw .

i actually used our son 's twin comforter and it fit perfect . but i bought the double size cover . 
dear kreg , thank you for your query about the aviator design . this is a duvet cover set . the double duvet cover set is 180cm wide and 210cm long or ( 71 83 inches ) and includes 2 pillowcases and 1 duvet cover . double is the closest size that corresponds to a full bed . hope that helps . kind regards , cottonbox kids . 
sorry i never weighed it . 
yes they are . 
yes it will , my sons is a twin and it fits great ! ! 
i believe it is standard , that 's what i have in my sons pillow case and it fits fine . 
no full size is smaller than a queen . and this full size quilt is a little smaller than most full size quilts . it probably would fit a twin perfectly . but i still love it for my sons bed . 
dear kristi , thank you for your query and interest in our aviator design . shipping rates calculated on weight and we do not have shipping promotions at this stage . kind regards , cottonbox team . 
hi vinod , these are the exact same bowls as the ones listed at $ 26.46 . i hope that helps . 
hi vinod , i am sorry for any confusion . while it says wean green on the page , they are different sellers . currently ruby & jane is selling these bowls for $ 22.99 . ( http : www.amazon.com wean-green-garden-lunch-multi-colored dp b00diesw7s ref=sr_1_sc_1 ? m=a1fh64irtqr80 & s=merchant-items & ie=utf8 & qid=1384629180 & sr=1-1-spell & keywords=wean+gree ) please let us know if you have any questions . we are happy to help . 
they are 13 oz 
thank you for writing in ! each of the wean green tempered glass containers holds 13 ounces . i hope that helps ! 
no screw is required . handle fits snug on mounting . 
i put my vacuum crevice tool over the handle.. wow ... fits and works just fine and lengthened to just the right size without taking the handle off . 
yes , but it did n't come with the handle . 
we wash ours in the dishwasher with no problem 
no , but they 're great quality . 
i believe they are , but would suggest you confirm for yourself 
i am not sure if there was a protective cover on the glass or not because i was not the one who put it together . but the mirror does not look like a circus mirror , the reflection looks just like any other mirror in the house . my 17 year old daughter uses it all the time . 
plastic but was n't described as such 
there are slots for 32 pairs of earrings 
yes , it is approximately 5 feet tall and 1 foot wide . 
this jewelry armoire is the best for all types of jewelry , you just have to know how to organize them , otherwise you will hav trouble to keep the the door closed.. but everything fix there perfectly if you know how to acomodate them ... all my friends who had seen it.. lov it ! ! and mee too . 
its a real mirror , glass 
no it is way to heavy no brackets 
yes ! the are pouches . 
no , but it 's easy to assemble . 
it seems like it 's glass ... ... it 's definitely not plastic . it works great and there 's no issues with mine at all . i 'm very happy with it . 
about 32 oz up to the red fill line seen in the photo . the contents only stay pressurized for 2 days . 
i would strongly suggest against it . over pressurizing can lead to the canister exploding . i saw one go once . pretty scary . 
yeah your missing the straw . there are replacement parts sold on line . i would google it . good luck ! 
no 
make sure the plastic straw tightly fits the round plastic part , and that both together create a seal at the top of the bottle before you add the top black handle+ charger ( make sure that part is tightly screwed in ) . when you 're ready to add your co2 , do it quickly ( no gas should escape ) and when the bubbling action stops , shake bottle for about a minute . good luck ! 
yes , you can . 
there is n't . however , i expect the glass to last well past the ten year mark with good maintenance and gentle care . i love my siphon . 
yes , go . 
use cold water , fill it up no further than the line , and shake the bottle after releasing the gas from the cartridge . 
no , it will not 
i bought this as a gift so i have n't actually seen it myself . i 'm sorry ; i wish i could be of more help . 
the ring is 26 '' and the length is approximately 8 ' . i created a cute reading area for my daughter that works great . hope this helps . 
yes - this was far too large for my daughters twin . should easily fit a double and probably even a queen 
yes - you need to put a hook of some sort into the ceiling and the net has a loop on the top that slips on to the hook . 
yes , and it 's super easy to set up . 
it parts in the middle for entrance or the sides can pull completely back so bed linens can removed replaced . 
the holes are n't the smallest but i could still see it working ... 
i received mine back in the summer , my 3 year old pulls on it all the time , it has proved to be very durable ! i am surprised at it 's durability . 
it probably just got out of the hoop during shipping . you just have to pull the elastic to widen the hole and place the hoop inside . i had to remove the hoop to wash the fabric before using . it 's super easy to remove and put it back on . 
dear colin , yes , we have . here is the asin : b00hnmjzg8 , search it on 
its light pink or kind of baby pink 
no 
no . not at all ! 
yes , it 's quite large . 
hi , you need the following part : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00sbsh70e kind regards alan @ selectric 
hi , no . this is not the correct part . we do stock the correct one but it is not currently listed on amazon .

hi , could you please confirm the model number on the base of your vacuumcleaner . it should start with an s. thanks 
no 
they should work - but you may need the torsion spring too

it runs ... not pretty . we had to put room temperate bottles of water on a table and people seemed fine with that . it was the winter time so having cold water was n't a necessity . 
yes , i used them for the smaller bottles . 
no they are not 
i guess so . this is a mini idali stand . 
the height of the stand is 6-inches 
yes , but size of plate is very small . 
all 4 inches of the mattress is memory foam . it 's a little firm , but not like a tempurpedic . 
twin size sheets fit the size i have . 
i ordered the 6 '' thick version . i unzipped the cover and you can see 4 '' of regular open cell foam that 's quit firm and a 2 '' layer of tempur-pedic type memory foam glued on top of that . 
i have the same mattress and it 's 4 '' per each section . 
we purchased two and we were surprised that they were compressed into a rather slender box , but once we unwrapped them and let them re-inflate , they were exactly as they had been described on the site . we have used ours many times and they actually are quite comfortable . if after 24 hours they are not 4 '' in all areas , i would suggest that you contact the company and request a replacement . 
probably not . this mattress is longer than a standard twin mattress . 
the dimensions of the mattress are 78 '' x38 '' x4 '' . since it folds into thirds , divide the length by the length by three and multiply the thickness by 3 which gives 26 '' x38 '' x12 '' . get a tape measure and see if that will fit in your suv . 
folds with cover 
i have been sleeping on this for several months ; i do not notice any lingering smell . 
i do n't think it will work well . that being said , if the dimensions are the same and you are looking to replace the previous cushions , i suppose you could try it . the worst case scenario is that you would end up with an extra sleeping bed for company . 
no . i just fold it up and store it in the closet of our guest room . 
the mattress is compressed in a compact 1 ' x 1 ' x 4 ' box . it quickly returns to its original shape when it 's removed from the box . 
i doubt it because it is split into thirds . i imagine for a futon it needs to be able to fold in half lengthwise ... 
hi daphne , it comes compressed in its stacked form folded in a cardboard box , there 's a possibility that the box may be 36 '' but i do not recall the exact measurements but you can do some good estimates according to its laid out dimensions of 78 '' length of all three pads , 38 '' width 6 '' thick . 
no , it 's very seamless and comfortable . the only thing i would say to watch out for is if you are moving the mattress around . i was dragging it into place one day and it almost felt like i could 've ripped it where the folds are . the seams are strong there , i just did n't want to test it . 
that would be nearly impossible without ruining it 
do not know 
hi . sorry , i had to get the pad out to look for this and i 'm afraid i do n't have the answer . if this would be on the attached tag , it is not . there is a tag that says outside materials inside and i read that and did n't find the comment anywhere . sorry i 'm not more help ... .or maybe that answers your question . all i know is it is very comfortable , but also very big and sort of hard to move around ... .at least for me . 
if you are accustomed to memory foam then yes . for me i would get tired of sleeping on the floor . the mattress is comfortable but i would want a platform etc . 
this is the size of a twin bed mattress when it is unfolded and laying flat . i purchased the 6-inch thick by 78 '' x 38 '' 
it comes with ( 2 ) . 16 oz clear bottles . 
it is 9 '' tall to the top of the pump . 
recommend hand washing . learned the hard way that anything with a gummy label will gum up the food grinder assembly in your dishwasher causing it to malfunction . expensive problem to fix . 
it really depends on the type of liquid you place in the pump . thinner liquids will dispense slightly more than thicker . 
yes , the pumps are strong . i have had mine for about 5 months , use it several times a day , and it has not broken . the second bottle is sitting unused at the moment since the first is still like new . 
not sure if bottles come in actual colors , these are clear and can change color with whatever liquid you add inside . 
i did not have that problem . instead , neither pump would work . plus the craftsmanship was non-existent . looked like they came from the dollar store . also , both of the bottles i received were clear . did you get a blue one ? 
you have to squeeze out some soap and then twist to lock 
the threaded neck of the bottle measures 1-5 64 '' outside diameter ( including the threads ) , or just over 27 mm . the inside diameter of the pump top would be the same measurement . good luck !

( please note i originally answered `` usa '' because everything i could find on the web seemed to indicate as such . ) until i found the following buried in the product specifications at e-store.allclad.com : 'non-stick interior dishwasher safe 16 '' x 13 '' made in china ' . sigh . that 'll teach me to open my mouth before i finish my research . 
hi , my pan is 16 x 13. i think they are including the handles for the 20 measurement maybe for storage reasons . i love this pan . we struggled with makeshift arrangements to cook big birds and roasts . now it 's easy and much safer . no problem cooking a 24 lb . turkey . we just cooked one for thanksgiving . cheryl 
kent gave one pro of hard anodizing = non stick surface in an earlier response . a con would be that most hard anodizing is done on aluminum . essentially hard anodizing builds up an extra thick and stable coating of the base metal 's oxide form . so in this case its aluminum oxide . some people have bad reactions to aluminum so they would want to avoid hard anodized aluminum pans . stainless steel is on the other hand an alloy of iron , carbon and chromium . there seem to be less toxicity problems with stainless steel than with aluminum . stainless steel will wear harder and longer than an anodized pan but it will scratch and it has almost zero non stick properties . 
it 's very easy to clean . i use a paste of bar keepers friend with a damp sponge and food comes right off without being abrasive . 
i would recommend against broiling in this pan . the handles are relatively high and are likely to come in contact with the heating element . also , the sides of the pan are at least two inches high and the meat sits low in the pan . thus the sides will interfere with the airflow and effectively you will end up roasting , not broiling . 
yes . it 's heavy duty and i would be comfortable browning meat on the cook top before putting it in the oven . 
i 'll let you know after thanksgiving . i 'm planning on a 20 lb turkey , so i 'm hoping it will hold at least that ! 
yes , it 's a solid material throughout and there is no teflon or coating on the roaster.it holds the heat really well so be careful not to burn . 
all clad non stick coating applied to interior . has a lifetime warrenty from all clad 
i got this pan for my wife for christmas and we have used a few times since and there is no sign of warping . it has functioned exactly as expected - meaning it works really well . 
the center hole is 10.4 mm . you are correct . that is closer to 3 8 '' . 
i do n't have anything to measure mm right now but i placed old cutter on top of new blades and they are exactly the same size . these fit my grinder attachment and work very well for me . i am very pleased with these replacement blades . 
they are too small for a size # 8 meat grinder . to double check , your round meat grinder plates should be about 2 1 18 '' diameter . they they will work . if your plates are 2 3 8 '' which is a standard size # 8 then you need to buy the size # 8 blade . thanks from smokehousechef.com 
the new blad , not the one shown in the picture , does n't work well . i ordered the one shown in the picture but vendor did not send the right one to me . therefore , i refused to paid for it . 
if you are asking if you can push it around on the counter with your coffee maker on top of it , it will be hard as it grips the counter very well . the drawer itself is on rails so it slides out well . you just need room in front of it to pull it out . 
i do n't se why you could n't . they seem to be pretty sturdy . the top is like a non skid type of material . 
very sturdy , it 's made of metal . 
12 3 4in . x 12 3 4in . x 3in . 
there are 6 separated rows . 
the dividers are welded to the front and back of the drawer . they could be removed if you are handy with a dremel moto-tool with abrasive disk and have the appropriate safety equipment -- in other words , with enough enough , money , time and energy , almost anything is possible . i think i would look for another solution to your storage needs . 
sides are an open mesh that i believe could be covered with a black contact covering cut to fit or other material that suits you . the exact width measurement is 13 1 8 inches . yes , trim is stainless . it is very sturdy . i have my keurig on top of it and i love it ! ! hope this help and if any other questions ... ..question away ! ! 
yes , it 's very sturdy . even my large keurig , filled with water , will not cause this particular drawer to sag ! 
they are single-sided in that the juice groove is only on one side . 
the manufacturer , bellissima , responded back that this product is bpa free ! ! ! 
small cutting board -- 5 '' x 7 '' medium cutting board -- 6 '' x 8 '' large cutting board -- 7 '' x 10 '' 
the largest is 14 inches by 8 1 2 inches . the middle one is 11 1 2 by 7 inches , and the smallest is 10 by 6 1 2 inches . they are smaller than i thought they would be but i find them very useful . plus , they do n't seem to stain like my old ones did . 
china 
there is a low carb setting , and there is a recipe for low carb seed bread . you could use other recipes with that setting . 
it has two . 
to keep the paddles from sticking , i always drop a teaspoon or , truth be told , even a tablespoon of oil on each paddle before i place the first ingredients into the pan . then , after baking , if the paddles still stick , i lay the hot pan on its side ( holding it with kitchen mitts ) and wiggle the undersides of the paddles until they spin . at that point , i can turn the pan upside down and the loaf falls out onto the cutting board without a problem . let me know if this works for you , too . 
yes , there is a gluten free setting and one recipe in the book . however , this is my fourth bread maker and i do not like it so would suggest you look into machines . hope this helps . 
if you are referring to the holes left by the paddles , there is no way that i know of . as to removal from the pan , i run a spatula around the entire pan -- inserting it all the way to the bottom of the pan . 
not very bright at all , but a nice machine . recipes are a bit different , and i have n't had much luck converting recipes from my 1 1 2 pound bread machine . might be error on my part . i do love the 3 lb capacity . 
the bread machine has to cool off completely before making another loaf . 
the paddley can only be put on the shafts in one position because the shafts are shaped to fit the inside shape of the paddles . you can position them any way you wish . i usually put them so they are at opposite positions corner to corner . using a map reference , one is pointed nne and the other ssw . that is the best way to get good mixing action in the dough . 
it does make noise but not enough to make you yell to the person you 're conversing with . if i had to compare it to something i would say an automatic pet feeder dispensing food . it 's nowhere near as loud as say a food processor or blender . 
i 've used lard ; approximately the same measurement . tastes great ! 
no , standard 12 oz beer bottle is too long to fit in bin . 
this container will hold approximately 9 bottles easily . stacked 5 deep on bottom layer and 4 on the top . the bin however , can not be stacked with another unit . the top layer of bottles protrudes above the side guide rails and they are not designed to be stacked with another unit . 
it holds the 16.9 oz water bottles 
it 's in product description as 13 '' w x 12'l . however , they neglect to mention that the space between shelves is about 4 1 4 inches . also , and most important , the product in the photo is very misleading . the shelves are actually bigger and did not fit in my ( not mine , landlord 's ) hotpoint top freezer . however , they fit in the bottom fridge and help containing my yogurt containers and biscuit cans . ps : not made for heavy stuff . 
hello , i did not purchase this particular product . i purchased the wine and the soda bottle version . they do have room between the bottles and the bottom of the holder that was stacked . but not sure about this one . sorry . 
no rubber on this product . all plastic but sturdy . 
16 ounce water bottles fit perfect . love it . 
a 20 ounce gatorade and or an 18 ounce poland spring bottle will fit with ease . 
not sure ... it does hold a16oz dasani and a 32oz gatorade . hope that helps ! 
yes it does . i have smaller water bottles in it right now ( 8 oz ) and just tried an 8 oz coke bottle - i stack these lengthwise , however , and it holds up to 24 of the 8 oz bottles . it also holds the larger water and soda bottles , but i stack those width-wise , which is what i usually use . what i like best about this bin is that the bottles are neatly stacked and , of course , are never toppling over as before when i tried to stand them on the refrigerator shelves . i am considering getting another one for my v8 juice . 
yes - the reverse side is gray and has the names of cities like ny and paris written on it . the pattern is the same as the pillow cases shown in the photo . 
this is duvet you can put comforter in it.. 
no 
any `` full '' size comforter will fit it just fine . queen is too large ! it can be inexpensive like from target or wal-mart , since it 's going inside the duvet cover . good luck ! 
mine did not . i bought one from amazon 
duvet and two pillow cases . not shams . the set is nice , but order a size up if you have a thicker mattress . 10 '' or more . 
yes

you only get the two with the writing on them , black and gray pillow cases 
two pillow cases are what 's included . no decorative pillows . still a great deal . beautiful set , we love it 
2 pillow cases and a duvet cover . not the duvet . it was a heat purchase 
i am unaware of who that person is , but i ca n't imagine that this is anything more than a seascape collage created on someone 's computer in a few hours . its cool alright . do n't get me wrong . love it . use it everyday . 
height 2 '' each and diameter 6.25 inches . 
it 's a nice piece of equipment for use in a pressure cooker . can cook several different dishes at once . 
the diameter is six inches . 
i usually get at least 30 hours . 
yes it does . it 's normal position is at 90 degrees and you can push the fan back to whatever angle you want . 
yes , works with ac adaptor only . i do n't even put batteries in unless i 'm going to be using it where ac is n't available . 
i think if the material is thin , wrung out well & put in front of the fan on high overnight , it could dry it . i would n't bank my wardrobe on it but if there was a spill on the only blouse you had for that outfit , i would give it a go . dry jeans ? no . 
oh yes , and easily . you just pull of the front screen and wipe down the blades . i double love this fan . ( if you have any trouble removing the screen face the fan toward yourself securely and squeeze on opposite edges . it 'll pull right off . ) 
actually , previous answers are true , but incorrect in terms of answering your question . : - ) it retracts to completely flat horizontal ( in theory could shoot air straight up ) , but it opens to a max just shy of 90 degrees horizontal . in other words , you can not sit it on a high ledge and angle it downwards . you would have to get creative , flip it upside down so it 'hangs ' from its base instead ( would need clearance under the overhang to achieve your stated desire to angle it downward , and would probably have to put a counter weight on the 'bottom ' of its base ( facing the ceiling in the described configuration ) . hope that helps ! 
it 's not heavy at all you will be good . 
i do not have an adapter for my car but i believe it would be easy to set up . the fan comes with a 110v transformer , cord and fan plug . all you would need to operate from a car is a cigarette plug for your car ( to fit into the car electrical outlet ) and enough cord to fit your needs plus a small plug to fit the fan . purchase a small plug similar to the one on the end of the current 120v cord that will fit the fan and attach it to the cord with the cigarette plug already mentioned . since the fan operates off 12v it should work fine . be aware that it will eventually run the car battery down . you will need some basic electrical knowledge to make this cord up . if your basic electrical knowledge is limited suggest you find a friend who could help . good luck . 
what ever it is ours did not work with battery and they sent a new one and it still did not work . walmart sells the o2 and it works . 
i guess i 'm not sure what the question is . what has probably happened , and amazon is doing this with increasing frequency , is that the someone purchased this fan , found it to be defective and returned it . it should work with the adaptor . if it does n't it is defective . also , we tried two sets of 6 of these fans over two years for our outdoor art shows and they move almost no air . i gave the first set away and returned the second set . 
225 
no , it 's just a fan and filter 
it uses 3 hepa filters and 3 carbon pre-filters ( one on each hepa filter ) . 
for parts and availability , please call us at ( 800 ) 546-5637 ; monday through saturday from 8 am to 8 pm , est . 
no . 
there is no large filter , ,it uses 3 `` b `` filters by holmes , ,the prefilters fit on the side of the b filters , the best prices on the b filters are on amazon , ,for about $ 25 for 2 filters , ,you willl 3 , ,they are available at walmart for about $ 10 more 
not that i 'm aware of . 
i would check the wall receptacle for loose plug in or wire connections . if they are ok and you do n't see any other items dim in power , than i would suspect the holmes unit to be defective . i would ask for a replacement from amazon right away , it could cause a fire . so could the other items mentioned . good luck 
there are 3 hepa filters . they suggest replacing them every 6 months . the charcoal filters that cover each hepa filter are supposed to be changed every 3 months . 
so far i have not notice that issue . i have two of these machines running 10 hours a day and they are working better than the last ones i have that i had . 
it goes in from the front panel and comes out the top . you can place the unit against a wall without issues . 
on the top , surrounding the on off switch . 
i find it is pretty loud . it definitely can not be characterized as quiet or unnoticeable . 
recommended for rooms up to 257 square feet . 
yes . 
this unit requires two hepa filters ( hapf600 ) and two carbon filters ( hapf60 ) . 
no . 
lowest height is 251 2 and highest height is 30 
seat is 13 1 2 across ( wide ) , lowest sitting height is 25 1 2 and the highest is 32 1 2. sits solid even at highest . the lower part - foot rest ( or circled part ) is 16 1 2 across ( wide ) . the legs at the bottom are 20 1 2. but i 'm sure you can angle the chair legs to fit a tighter fit . hope this helps . 
yes , it can be stained all it needs is to be sanded and then stained the color of your choice ! hope this helps ! 
we have just purchased , 2 and then 2 more of these stools , very sturdy . not sure what type of wood , but very light . we have sanded lightly and stained a darker color to match our decor , which was easy . we delivered right away , i am very pleased so far , one caution ; the plastic protecters on the bottom of tha legs tend to crack , we put felt furniture protecters on anyway so this is no big deal . 
10 inches from the floor . 
no 
they are welded . they are very sturdy . we are well-pleased with our purchase of 6 . 
they are n't bad . we use them daily 
the wooden seat is 13 1 4 inches . 
i have used these popsicle molds to make healthy juice popsicles , yogart and fat free pudding pops and yes i think my mom would approve 
my experience was as follows : when my order went to a `` shipped '' status , they emailed the notification that is was being shipped , and attached was a .pdf file , which was the ebook . i simply clicked on the link for the ebook and it started to download . you will need to install adobe reader if you have never dealt with .pdf 's before . i hope this helps ! 
from the base to the top of the handle is 6.75 inches . my shelf in the freezer is not that high , so what i do is set something flat i have in the freezer ( like a box of lasagna ) and put the popsicles on it until they freeze . then take them out of the stand and lay them wherever you have room . i hope this helps . i love my popsicle molds , i can make healthy treats . 
hmmm , i do n't recall getting recipes , but i just experiment . my favorite now is to put in a combination of blackberries , raspberries , blueberries with a roughly equal portion to all that of strawberries . then i throw in about 5 bananas ( this pretty much is all that will fit in my vita-mix ) . i add blue agave for sweetening and , my best part , chocolate ! i use the hershey 's sundae double chocolate . i notice when it is still liquid , this `` smoothie '' has a slight bitter taste from the chocolate , but when frozen , it just tastes great . the chocolate does n't freeze `` hard '' like the other stuff does so , when mixed together , it gives a popsicle that is n't so rock hard either . i do n't put any water ( or ice ) , milk , or other liquid in with it when blending . 
there 's no indication on the box or the product where it was made . 
the popsicles would be 2 3 8 wide , length is 3 3 4 when taken out of the mold . the tip of the mold has a 1 4 in more in length to insert into the stand . 
ozs. , grams , litters , who knows , all i can think of is that the door to the white house is open to hillary while 25 repukeblicans are belliaching , anyhow the molds are men size , like the large mexican pops , they are not the peewee midget size that you have to eat 3 , one of these and you are happy , but they are sort of hard to open but they are worth it.. 
i am having the same problem although i have only tried `` adult popsicles '' and they have booze in them . i will try the reg and see what happens . i really think maybe the stick is too short . 
they sent us an email with the ebook a few days after we received the molds in the mail . 
how long ago did you order ? i got a follow up email from the company who sent the popsicle molds about 7 days after i ordered . in that email it states if you did not get your e-book to contact them and they would help . i had nothing but good luck with them and they were very responsive . 
i really had no problem with this injector . it ' s nice to use . 
anything that is not stainless steal is mad of rubber or silicone 
sorry i have no way to measure them . maybe 1 4 
i do n't know , but amazon stands by their product . i love it . feel like a surgeon every time i use it . 
the needles are 5 1 2 '' ... ..with 1 2 '' of threads . total length is 6 '' . hope this helps . 
this is a little different . this is essentially a metal syringe for injecting into the body . you could use it as a baster as well but the opening at the end is much smaller . 
my tag says china ... sorry ! 
probably . the quality was not that good . the stitching came out in a short period of time . i did n't leave it on my bed two months ! 
my bedskirt is 15 inches long . 
i love love love love my comforter ! it is just as pretty in person as it in the picture . however , if you are hot nature you will not want to sleep under it . it 's very toasty ! 
i would dry clean it . 
i would think they 'd be great . my son does n't have a glass top stove but i do at home and use similar cookware . that 's why i bought him this . anyway , they 're very flat on the bottom which is what we need with glass tops . 
so far as i know , there 's only one line of cookware branded emeril ( there 's not different tiers of quality ) . if the set has it pieces you want and it 's cheaper elsewhere , go for it ! 
this set is triply . i love it . 
yes it is induction safe . although i did return my set . we found that it had some nice design features , but found the set to be too light weight and found the set with a couple of dents upon delivery . 
yes there was a steamer included in the set 
the only markings i see on them say emril 
the set is designed by not manufactured by all-clad . 
i do n't eat meat . my guess is that it would manage four neatly , but no more if you want them to cook evenly . i am extremely happy with mine so far . i do find that doing frozen pizza means using the middle shelf and not the low one they suggest . but otherwise i really like and it has worked perfectly . keep in mind it 's still basically a very good toaster oven and they are not just like using a big oven . but i 've had really crummy ones that were n't cheap and had problems with horribly uneven baking , food burned way too easily , temp contros failing too soon in the life of the machine and this is sooo much better . i'v baked potatoes , both sweet and white , baked pastry , made hot sandwiches and baked pizzzas . all very well done in this one . very happy . it is very well made . not like a tin box like so many . oh , cleaningis very easy , in my opinion . 
10.5 '' x 15.5 '' but the handle sticks out a further 2 '' . 
yes , it shuts off on it 's own with a loud beep to let you know . you can also adjust the time while it 's baking . we 're going on 2yrs with this little oven and it still works like new . wo n't buy any other brand from now on . 
i have no idea for i never used it . 
no it does n't , you have to pull the rack out yourself . 
120 volts 
i believe it is 6 months , not sure . 
this ice maker works with a lot of refrigerator models . if it looks like the one in your fridge , which is the same brand , it most likely will work . i matched the pic and replaced mine with this one and it worked great . easy to install . only be concerned if it looks totally different . 
basicly all the ice makers that go in freezer compartments of refrigerators are the same . the differences are the way they connect ( plug ) and that the 4 wire colors match up with the one you are removing . unless you are sure that your viking is compatible with , for example , a whirlpool , you are better of calling an appliance parts dealer and insuring you are getting the right one . i bought one via amazon and it turned out some of the wire colors were reversed . i needed an appliance repair guy to resolve the issue and it ended up costing me more than just calling him in the beginning . 
thearm is supposed to move up then the ice comes out . if the arm can not go all the way down production will stop until the ice is depleted far enough . listen for the ice when itejects . opeo the fridge immediately to see if the arm is in the up position . you may have to bend it down a bit to make it stop producing ice . be sure to hold the part where it connects to the unit so you do n't damage it . 
yes it will i put it in it has worked perfect good ice maker they last about 5-7 years 
no , it did not . 
installed the one i ordered in a whirpool . 
the one listed by hotspot electronics is a kit and may include additional items 
i recommend that you telephone whirlpool customer service . 
i am not certain , but this icemaker fits a lot of brands and models , lots of them . it was very easy to , replace , my worn out one , no one shoild ever pay anyone to replace one . you might google your mn . and locate a replacement ice maker pn.. it should be the same number . sorry i can not be more specific . 
i googled your refrigerator model number , and it appears this ice maker will fit . please visit http : www.repairclinic.com shop-for-parts a4b5c47d577632 model-ed25lfxgb00-whirlpool-refrigerator-ice-maker-parts to confirm ! the ice maker they show on the repair clinic page is the whirlpool 4317943 . 
i am sorry i do n't know i just found the one that was for my model number and it worked . sorry i could n't help u . 
do n't know 
it worked for me . yes . 
no-i do not believe this part will fit your whirlpool dishwasher . since it is a frigidaire part , it only fits dishwasher models made by frigdaire such as gibson , kelvinator , tappan and white-westinghouse . i 'd suggest checking online to find the correct part # you are looking for . 
yes ! just follow instructions with it ! 
the winds of the internet seem to point to part 5300622034 for your dryer . part 5300622032 ( the one you are inquiring about ) has 1 4 '' terminals whereas the part ending in `` 34 '' has 5 16 '' terminals . granted i 'm not a parts guy . you may want to put in a call to your local appliance repair center to verify part and prices , if no one else replies . 
i personally do not know , my repair technician managed it , and how ? i have not seen . it is working now ok for us . 
i have a fridgidaire dryer and it worked fin in that . i would suggest getting a fuse too . i blew mine after i replaced the coil . it 's cheap and easy as well , but you might as well do them at the same time . 
it works on any electrical dryers in us 
the dryer feq1442ce uses 5 16 the size of this one here is 1 4 : : : : that being said : : : terminal size : 5 16 inch . for the 1 4 inch terminal size order 5300622032. this electric dryer heating element restring coil does not include the heater housing insulators 131472100 or the terminal block 3202786 . 
element rated at 5200 watts 
yes ... .just have to take it apart . 
yes this works on all electric dryers when installed proberly 
yes it 's ok si esa pieza si me sirvi , soy tcnico en appliances y la utilizo regularmente , tanks for askme 
40 watt 
it is for underneath the microwave . 
2 '' x1 '' 
i replaced a 30 watt dwe 125 volt bulb with this one in a microwave and it works satisfactorily . the glass envelope is a little shorter than my original bulb , so it will fit in a more compact space . it is rated at 40 watts , so it will produce more light and run a little hotter . in my amana microwave it is working without a problem . 
yes it was 
it is on most of the time at my house . if your bulbs are burning out after a few weeks it may be that the mother board needs to be replaced . 
i purchased it for my maytag over the range microwave ... model # mmv5208ww 
when you add `` qty 1 '' of this product to your cart , then buy it , you can only expect to receive one bulb . 
no 
not sure but it worked in my whirlpool microwave which operates on household current . 
i used this pump to replace the stock one on my frigidaire model 417 clothes washer , it fit perfectly and i 'm back up and running . here 's a video where you can see the type of washer : https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=shgxy-u5ukg . good luck ! 
get part number off of your old pump and run it on the search at amazon . sometime amazon will show you some items that do not match your part number , be sure the part numbers match . 
go to amazon and enter your pump number and it will display the pumps that will work for your model . 
get part number off of part and run it on e-part replacement part web-site to match it to your model number . or just take part number to amazon from your part and put in . 
yes 
this should work . the kenmore model i installed this pump on is the sears branded version of your frigidaire . i found it easier to use some screw-tightened hose clamps rather than the spring hose clamps that come with the pump , the angle was a little awkward for me to get a good grip on the pliers while trying to position the clamp . good luck ! 
i used the old base from the water pump to make my new pump in the correct position . 
i do not think it will.. model should be on the back or on the inside of the lid where it closes 
yes 
i dont have a frigidaire , mine is a kenmore . the serial number is on the back of the washer on a tag , this tag has many numbers . the serial number and the product number are all you need . if you go to the frigidaire website you can get info on how to identify your model . good luck . 
that does n't coincide with what ours does . it was on continuously , until it reached the level we selected ( started at 65 ) , then it would go on and off as needed . 
i would visit this website and you will find the manual http : www.sunpentown.com sd50pidewibu.html 
you have to build a special bracket for it . the plastic shell will not be able to support its own self weight . 
did you try washing it first ? this is info on downloaded manual ... .sunpentown international inc. 14625 clark ave , city of industry , ca 91745 tel : 1-800-330-0388 service @ sunpentown.com www.sunpentown.com 
the book does n't say . i would think 6 or 7 feet would be fine , though . the previous dehumidifier that i owned could lift 13 feet . 
yes . when it reaches desired humidity setting , the compressor shuts off first and the fan continues to circulate air for a few mins . it will automatically turn back on when humidity rises . 
if the room humidity reaches the setting humidity , the compressor will turn off right away but the fan will run for extra 2-3 mins and then shuts off . the suggested room size is 350 sq . ct. it may not be able to handle 800 sq ft room . it comes with one year warranty for labor and part from the purchase date . if any question , please contact us at 1-800-330-0388 . 
specs say 4.7a with starting current of 22a 
it is made in china . 
i had no problem with noise from the unit . even slept with it in a small bedroom and was surprised i did n't notice it after a short while . it is rated for 800 square ft. which meant i had to move it around until the problem resolved , but that was my fault for not paying attention to the details . otherwise very pleased with the product . hope this helps . 
my unit pumps from my basement floor up to where the a c pipes leave the basement wall , about 6 ' vertical , has run for months with no problem . 
it will operate to temperatures down to 50 degrees ! i believe and it does have an auto defrost feature . i love my unit , especially the pump which allows me to drain the water into a sink . the only problem i had with this unit was leakage at the drain hose connection but easily corrected that by removing the plastic connector and inserting the hose further into the drain hole . i highly recommend this product . 
i use mine in a basement where it does n't get that cold . but if it gets to 30 degrees , that is below freezing so i imagine the water could freeze in the drain hose or the holding tank plus anywhere it travels in order to get to those places which might be harmful to the unit . just a thought , i do n't know for a fact . 
it needs to have adequate ventilation . i believe the instructions said at least 8 '' around . 
it 's made in china . spt sunpentown is located in california . 
easy to reach and clean . it puts out a lot of heat so not good in a small space . ours is in a utility room and it was ok all summer . 
6 feet 
none for the gravity flow ... it 's made for that connection ... it 's a different connection for the pump , but the necessary hose is included with the dehumidifier ... . 
extremely quiet , mine is in crawl space below kitchen and i never hear it . i have mine powered by extension cord ( heavy duty ) . 
i would think that if you had it in a bedroom , the noise might keep you up and the heat it generated would make it uncomfortable especially if it blew on your bed . i suggest you put it in an adjacent room , maybe a bathroom , and it will will not be a problem . plus you can easily place the drain hose for the water into the toilet tank.that is what i did . 
no 
height 13 '' width 17 1 2 '' depth 14 1 2 '' 
abo 13 inches high , 17 inches wide and about 15 inches deep 
it was pretty light as i recall and it is shipped flat . 
no , its not intended to be , and i do n't see any way to set it up . at the top tier of the unit , the sides do not even reach as high as a soup can , so if you tried attaching another rack to the top , you would lose the space of that top shelf . 
14.5 x 17.5 x 13 inches 
according to the packaging instructions , cake toppers should be good for a year . i ordered my son 's cake topper in february , his birthday was in march . it arrived fairly quickly . i would suggest ordering now just in case and storing in a room temperature place where it will not be bent or where temperature does n't fluctuate . also double check with the bakery you 're ordering the cake from to see if their policy allows for outside cake toppers to be used . i was told at the bakery that it was a cross contamination issue therefore i had to put the cake topper on myself which worked just fine . i hope this helps . 
yes , or personalize by adding a gift message . check `` this is a gift box '' after adding to cart , or send me an email with your order # and name you want on your cake topper 
please send me an email with your order number or or personalize by adding a gift message . check `` this is a gift box '' after adding to cart 
yes - top rack . however , i do not use the dry cycle on my dishwasher . do n't use the dry cycle if you are putting these in the dishwasher because i ca n't guarantee they wo n't melt.. i love these . this is my second set after 8 years of using the first . one of the magnets came out of one of the measuring cups and i melted one side of one on the stove , so had to get a new set . 
they say `` made in china '' on the cups . 
the stack of cups is about 2-7 8 inches tall . 
yes . thanks ! 
they 're a little over 10 inches 
mavrick gas stations , $ 1 each 
one 
yes $ 3.99 each.. 
not supposed to use it in a regular oven only a microwave 
no , it 's completely lead free . you would n't be able to microwave it otherwise . : ) 
yes . but be aware the $ 10 is for one stonewave , not two . i received mine very promptly through amazon , but i 've not yet used it . 
1 4 teaspoon of water in the cooker . crack an egg into the cooker add salt & pepper to taste . put lid on and microwave for 20 seconds . leave it in the microwave and wait another 20 sec to let it set . cook again for 20 more seconds and remove from microwave . if you want cheese , sprinkle finely shredded cheese on top as soon as its done . place lid back on for 45 seconds and the cheese will melt nicely . no need to place it back in the microwave 
it is actuly kinda small , just right for a single person . i put in 3 eggs for an omlet that fluffs up to the rim . i woud think they should come out with other sizes . but if you order more than one you probly wont be disappointed . in one review it said the hadle gets hot but mine dosnt at all . have a great day i hope it works out for you . 
yes , select a potatoe to fit the wave , make a slice about 1 8 to 1 4 deep across the top of the potatoe , add a tablespoon of water , cook in micro-wave starting at two minutes , test for doneness , if two minutes does'nt suit then cook in increments of one minute . you will soon find out how long to cook to satisfaction . when through cooking press potatoe open and serve with butter and sour cream if desired right in the wave . bon appetite 
it is for microwave use only and most recipes cook in just one or two minutes . for one or two servings , just place a little food such as thinly sliced onion or mushrooms or carrots in the cooker with a little seasoning , one teaspoon of white wine or water and cook for two minutes . i never fill the cooker more than 1 3 or 1 2 full and the food always comes out like oven baked . to make a delicious single serving of cake just pour your regular batter in the cooker and microwave it on high for one minute . just experiment , you will get the hang of it . 
i have heated caned soup . it does a great job . but it is so small , it barely fits . right up to the top . it would be great if they made it just a little bigger . i believe the design is based on a morrocan tagine . it can also be used to reheat . 
from the manufacturer : inside diameter is 4.5 inches , the total length is 6.5 inches with handle and is 3.5 inches high . 
time to cook 2 eggs is 1 1 2 minutes 
if you just replaced the batteries with new ones . go into the neato menu . select `` support '' then select `` new batteries '' and put it on the charger . this option lets the neato know to recalibrate how to read the power level of the batteries and charge . see if that helps . otherwise , try plugging the charger directly into the port on the back of neato and see if they charge that way to rule out that there is not something wrong with charging base itself . 
yes the neato requires two batteries . 
the neato robotics website shows one size battery for all of their models . i have not had any problems with crucial vacuum batteries . i am very satisfied with them . 
i returned them because i could n't get them to charge . 
yes , it can work with the xv-21 . i 'd bought for spare to the xv-21 . 
just got mine and they 're the same rating as the originals : 3200mah . 
i have the vue , and yes it fits . ( do n't forget that the bottom drain part is removable on the vue for taller cups ! ) 
i have the 20 ounce , it does not fit under my breville keurig brewer without the drip tray , i have to tilt it to fill it with coffee . i imagine the height is the same as the elite keurig . 
hi , open access lid is a feature of the lid that can be opened inside for better cleansing . and yes , we have latte available too 
i do n't think it would be comfortable . the top is n't sharp per se , but thin and i would imagine it gets fairly hot . 
yes . it is not dishwasher safe , and handwashing is easily done . 
yes , i expect it should . it appears to be an anodized finish on aluminum which should lend itself to laser engraving . 
no . you press the button and it starts . you press the button again and it stops . it 's not at all a problem because you 're making espresso -- it 's not like it takes long to make ! 
i purchased the coffee duck refillable pods , and they worked marginally but made extremely weak coffee with no crema ( the espresso foam ) on top . we were so bummed ! we have a custom grinder and played around with setting it to super fine , medium fine , etc . and nothing seemed to help . we tried packing the pods tight , leaving a little room , etc . and still the coffee sucked . stick with the capsules ; they 're expensive up front , but worth it in the end . plus , nespresso 's capsules are rainforest-alliance certified , which is the highest certification for both sustainability and fair-trade . you can also recycle your pods now by turning them into sur la table . hope that helps ! 
yes you do . i am terribly pleased with it is a lovely machine & the milk frother is great 
mine did ! 
it probably needs to be descaled . your nespresso coffee machine should be descaled every three to six months . do a search online , especially on youtube , and it will show you step by step . your manual that came with the machine should have instructions as well . 
it is no longer being made . yes it uses the originalline capsules 
with the manual , you egress the button to both start and stop the brew . one the plus side , you control how tall or short your cup is . on the downside , you ca n't walk away or get distracted . i have both types of machines , one at home and one at work . i feel like the difference in quality is negligible when the price is compared . i do seem to have trouble getting up enough pressure to pierce the capsules on my manual sometimes . if you 're on a budget , the manual is fine and makes great espresso ! 
it holds 34 oz . not sure of the dimensions . 
110v 
it 's not much . maybe 3-4 pounds ? 
you would have to have a space at least 20 1 2 inches wide for this to go under . 
the table height is adjustable from 21.75 '' to 29.25 '' 
do n't know ; i was disappointed . top surface is not as large as the original and seems `` dinky '' compared to my first table mate . 
the price is as listed . shipping is calculated during checkout before you confirm payment . we do our best to describe the tables and stand behind the product . regretfully not everyone may share the same expectations . we have a great return policy and customer support if there is a need ! 
some do and some do n't . mine does n't have one . it may be because it is a table mate 2 . 
there 's nothing stamped on it anywhere . 
it has a release bar under the table . this item is not worth the cost , try ebay . 
the legs are on the floor so it slide under something up to an inch off the floor 
i have my laptop on it and also a laptop fan under it . it may depend on the weight of the laptop , but i have no problem with it . 
flat service : 14 '' x 19 '' . including rolled edges : 15 1 4 '' x 20 1 4 '' . 
i just use the hose from the vacuum cleaner , works really great ! 
yes they are , usually able to use over and over . just had my 1st experience of the bag actually tore open , felt brittle 1st time use . not too sure what happened . 
2 smallest bags are roll ups . 
mine worked fine twice so far . i had 3 in a large bag and then packed some other clothes i them for storage in a wall locker . 2 did n't make it however . there are large cuts in them . i could n't tell if the were from something in the bag with them or tsa 's rough handling of my luggage . either way they work as a any times as you need them so long as you 're not too rough with them . if they 're just being used for storage in a closet they 'd probably last a very long time . you also can just roll the air out of them if you do not have a vacuum . 
i have not used for clothing that would get wrinkled , only for blanquets , winter jackets and conforts - all bulky stuffs . 
there are special bags for travel that do n't require a vacuum to get the air out . you roll them and it takes the air out . i have some but have not used them yet but they do work cause i tested them . 
i think so . is n't a shop vac more powerful than a regular house vacuum cleaner ? i just use my house vacuum . 
i think they show in the product page items normally bought together and it shows i think a hand held manual vacuum . thats the link http : www.amazon.com amico-plastic-compressed-vacuum-deflation dp b00ao37pk6 ref=pd_bxgy_hg_img_y 
i have only had them for a short time ( 2 months ) . the mailed blankets in some and they did not leak . the ones i am currently using have not leaked . i just had one new one rip apart when i tried to close it . the rest i am using are working fine . 
yes it does , i only recommend these ziploc storeage bags because they do work , all others do not keep the air out . i hope this helps , happy hollidays jb 
i think the first responder 's stated dimensions are a bit misleading . actually measuring the receptacle itself , the outside dimensions without the lid are 6.5 '' x 11.75 '' x 11.75 '' . note the it does have a taper , so the bottom dimensions are a bit smaller . even screw-mounted to a door the depth is only 7.5 '' , so do n't know where that 8.7 '' is coming from . 
dear customer , the hook on the in-cabinet trash can measures 3 4 ( 0.75 ) inches at the attachment for the door . please let us know if you have any further questions . thank you , simplehuman 
the t-shirt bags will fit but i will never use them . lots of times they have little holes in the bottom or rip easily . you do get a few bags with the container when you order this and they are super nice and sturdy , sometimes i jam things in there and have not had a problem , they also grip the can so you do n't have to worry about the side sliding down . the bags are really worth a little extra money and i only want to handle the trash once . really love this and find it perfect for one person . good luck , kate 
yes ... it fits perfect ! not to mention it comes with 12 sample plastic bags too . 
no , the lid does not lock . but you could put one of these child proof locks on it ? http : www.amazon.com munchkin-xtraguard-count-action-latches dp b007a2zsz8 ref=sr_1_1 ? s=baby-products & ie=utf8 & qid=1397532862 & sr=1-1 
yes , you can hang it inside or outside , it 's perfect for small kitchens 
hi a dogged shopper , this particular model only comes in black , however , we do have many other cans that are available in other colors . feel free to check them out , and if you have any further questions , please do n't hesitate to call us at 877-988-7770 ( mon-fri 8am-5pm pst ) . we 're always here to help ! best , simplehuman 
it stays open 
i already had a mount on the inside of the door that the hook mount slid over perfectly . would recommend that design rather than over-the-door to prevent scuffing the door . 
i am using it same application and closes not tight but close so no flies comes out another thing i did was buy the carbon kit you place on the lid and this helps with smell and flies i love this bin and have other friends using it the same application 
while not quite a sphere , it is approx . 11 '' across . it is right at 4 '' deep where it rests on your neck . hope this is helpful . 
hi eric , thanks for your question about our available colors for our travel pillow . currently we can offer you our popular light purple colored neck pillow . we will also have a dark blue option in around 6 weeks from now . best regards , jude the crafty world team 
this pillow is great but doesnt really squish that much . i carry it on the plane with me . its more like a memory foam . hope that helps 
i do n't think that this pillow would easily attach to the headrest of a car . that being said , there is an elastic band that stretches and this may fit around the head rest ( depending on the size of the head rest ) , but i do n't believe that the elastic band itself will keep the pillow secure enough . it is a great pillow though ( i use mine every day on the train ) , and it may be worth a try . 
i honestly ca n't answer that . this was kind of a stocking stuffer for someone . 
i tried using it in a recliner and the sides hugged my face and made me claustrophobic . it was n't flexible enough for me . it had a mind of its own . 
sorry , i do not know . 
maybe -- i have never tried it -- it is actually too thick for me -- not comfortable ! ! ! 
yes . it would . 
11.6 ounces according to my postal weighing scale . 
not electric but auto 
yes , this item is can be purchased with a natural gas nozzle attached instead of propane . 
hi joyce i'am king sorry about the delay , yes you can control the 2 tanks . great fryer good luck 
do n't get this fryer i 'm returning it , it almost caught me on fire , it like blew up because they did n't attach the piping correctly , actually the piping was barely attached and as the gas went through it was leaking and i tried to light it and blew up a ball of flame ! 
china 
we no longer have it would not be good for a food place inside 
either one i got mine on metal it have rubber feets on it . 
with any propane supply , whether it be a 20lb or a 100lb tank , you need low pressure regulation after it to supply your cooking devices . this fryer in particular has a 3 4 '' connection which you can connect into your system . 
the fryer has a standard 3 4 '' connection for propane supply . your tank connects to a low pressure propane regulator ( sometimes a first stage and second stage depending on your setup ) and then to the fryer . 
i did n't get one . but when it arrived it was slightly damaged . but they gave me a choice of returning it or gave back some money back 
the mug does have a part of the lid bpa free plastic . the exterior and interior of the mug is stainless steel . 
i think this one will work . it fits standard cupholder in car very snugly . 
it is 2.5 inches at the bottom . getting slightly bigger on the way up . 
yes , it will fit a standard car , boat or truck holder . the product description has further information on other aspects of the mug . thank you for your interest . 
yes 
with the lid affixed , the height of the mug is just under 7 inches , so it 's compact . but it does hold 16 ounces . 
like the overwhelming majority of travel mugs , the top notch stainless steel travel mug is manufactured in china . thanks for your interest . 
cup is 6 1 4 inches tall , so i do n't believe it will fit under most models . 
hello ed k : yes , you can purchase additional o ring gaskets for our mugs . the diamenter of the gaskets are just under three inches and you can purchase them at hardware type stores or online at variety stores . amazon sells a variety of o ring gaskets . we choose this type of closure for our lids because it results in a snug suction fit and does not accidently screw loose with mug use . we recommend that you use the large grips along the siides to hold the mugs securely when in use . thank you so much for your interest in our top notch stainless steel mugs -- flagship collections and feel free to contact us with any additional questions . yes 
ed : i rhink our mug will fit your objectives . our mugs are stainless steel inside and out and that is very easy to clean . furthermore , the interior that holds your liquids , etc is smooth and has no seams . we also use a lid sealing system that means the lid sides are smooth and easy to clean . the o ring gasket is around the outside of the lid so its not in contact with mug contents ( see product images ) . i hope this answers your questions . please feel free to contact us again . 
the controls i have are digital and loom nothing like the picture . they have buttons for.on off and up and down from 1-10 i believe . hope that helps ! 
the one control ( double bed ) does not have the control pictured here . it is rectangle and longer on the top and bottom than the sides . there is a tiny red light that always stays on and you hit the control to make it hotter or cooler . the number of the hotness or coolness shows up digitally and is really big . 
mine did not have a skirt attached . it had a great elastic border that fit over my oversized mattress 
i have not had to clean it yet . the sheet goes on top of it , so while i wash the sheets i have not washed this mattress cover . 
i have the older ones 
no , i can not smell anything at all . the fluffy stuff on the top is actually quite nice , sort of extra cushioney . my only complaint is that the instructions say not to run the electric cords under the mattress . so , i had to shove them under the bed . turns out not to be a big problem . so far , i have used the heated mattress pad for about 2 weeks and like it find . 
i have other biddeford mattress pads that are still working and it 's been nearly 5 years since i bought my first one . this sherpa lined one is not nearly as warm as the quilted one . it is however more comfy . 
hard to say , but seems a little cozier . 
we put a fitted sheet over the heated mattress pad always . if you did n't do that you would have to wash the heated mattress pad more often and that would be hard on it . 
i so not know if there is a different , newer version . i bought this as a gift for my mom . she loves it ! sorry i ca n't be of more help . 
no timer 10h auto shut off 
it plugs into a 110 outlet 
has n't harmed mine . they get washed at least every month while in use . 
yes 
80 x 80 
there is no filter per se . you should use distilled or purified water particularly if you have hard water at the tap . there is a cleaning procedure that uses a mild detergent to clean the `` transducer '' in the event it gets dirty which is pretty simple . i have not had cleaning problems ( scale ) using the water i have but the transducer should be cleaned every so often especially before you store it . 
as i recall , it was cool . i do not recommend the humidifier unless you want everything in the vicinity soaking wet ( carpet , any furniture , books . ) , and that is on the low setting . mine is sitting in a box to be used only in a closed bathroom and who needs it when there is a shower there already . 
it says it is ranked for 120 volts which means it is a 110 volt appliance . it is a standard us appliance with a 2 prong plug . i hope this is what you were looking for . 
i have n't tried . i do n't think it is meant for them . it might gunk up the mechanics . maybe if you cleaned it each time but you are probably better off with one meant for them . 
great question : ) actually that is the strength of this model . it does not use a filter . in our home we have used the humidifiers with filters and they always end up molding . then you are running it in your child 's room with mold in the air ( not good ) . we use the one instead and my wife got rid of the other models with filters because of that . she loves it : ) so it is very popular and does not use a filter . my kids like it so much they even used it as a fog machine on halloween . as the seller of this item i have to say thats not its intended use though : ) let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
about 4 feet 
yeah , it 's bright . i actually roll up a washcloth and press it on it . it 's really not a big deal but , if it bugs you , you can easily remedy it 
i would suggest not . use a oil burner specifically for that and just use water in humidifier . 
great question : ) so you just follow the instructions in the manual on how to clean it with water and it also comes with a cleaning brush to clean it with . let me know if it has any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
unfortunately i do n't know . i have never used essential oils and do n't know how difficult ( if at all ) they are to humidify . it 's a great humidifier on it 's own though . if oils like that are typically okay to put into humidifiers then i would guess it 's okay . 
according to the directions you are not supposed to breath in the air that is put out from the ozone generator . in our application we let it run in a closed environment then aired out the area for about 1 hour prior to anyone entering . that said , there is no real odor to speak of , more like a clean air smell i can most closely attribute to a no fragrance febreeze . 
no cartridge . i believe the only 'user-serviceable ' parts are the plates and the uv bulb . by the looks of it , it should n't be difficult at all to replace . i will also say that the customer service this company offers is great . 
no nothing else : ) actually plants are fine to . the only precautions you need to take is people or animals because high doses of ozone ( this is a commercial very powerful unit ) can cause lung irritants . i know some people who stay in the room but we dont suggest it at all . if you follow the instructions it works very very good at removing powerful odors . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
5 years ... 
well if the body is still there probably not . but i have n't found an oder it wo n't get rid of . no filters it 's ultraviolet . the ozone it emits has a smell to it not bad but it lingers for a week or so . 
yes you can see the blueish light when it turns on . 
stephanie , your question ca n't be nailed down to exact science . the amount of cigarette smoke can go from a trace on a surface from a week of smoking to a tar build up . i have been using one of these at home for my cars , a camper , and in my basement . at work i 've done design work for ozone rooms to remove smoke smell out of furniture that has been in fires . yes an ozone generator can clean cigarette smoke . if it is smoke damage from years and years of build up , i 'm afraid you are on cleaning duty with brushes and cleaners until you get the tar removed . this baby will do a fine job after that . ~steve davis 
great question : ) i wanted to be sure for you so i went out and opened one up to check for sure . it does have the 2 hour timer and a hold setting as well . so yes your good to go : ) let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
great question . the manual will go over this in detail but most people will wait an hour before entering the room . it 's always a good idea to open any windows and doors to let the room air out after using the purifier . thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
yes just make sure the air is cut on most smells are trapped inside the vents 
papalardo sends most items the same day . priority mail with expedited shippping takes 2-3 days . 
yes this sheet come with 6 different images for a total of 12 , but if you like i can print one sheet with the same image . 12 month shelf life . 
yes , i will send them priority mail . thank you 
they are pre-cut , shelf life is 12 months . always keep image stores at room temperature , be sure to keep it in a sealed air thigh zip-lock bag inside the packing envelope out of any direct light , until ready to apply to cake . 
it come as a sheet and i think they are somewhat perforated , but i ended up using a round cookie biscuit cutter to cut them out . 
they will work on any frosting , just needs to be large enough cookie for the toppers as they melt onto the frosting after 15-30 minutes . 
i am not sure . i advised the children with the above allergies not to eat the cupcakes . 
yes . that is what i used them for . they worked great . 
75 units 
yes 
normal is just standard operations for the fan , nature is breeze ( fan goes slower and faster randomly ) , and sleep mode lets you set a timer so it turns off automatically . 
it is louder then i would have wanted it but it cools a room down and has a strong wind flow . so that overrides any noise issue i have . when watching tv and it is on low it is fine but if you put it up to high then you might want to put the volume up . it does not bother me when sleeping as it acts as white noise and is easy to sleep rest to . 
it just recycles the air- does not cool . i has a digital read out for the temp but that is all . 
there are lights and an lcd display at the top . they do n't look bright but i only sue mine during the day . i 'd the lights are too bright they could easily be covered with black tape but i do n't think they 'd be a problem unless you like a pitch black room . 
the timer goes from 1 to 12 hours . 
no one i have doesnt 
it is cylinder ( round ) shaped about 6 inches across 
no , the leds are not bothersome at all - matter-of-fact , they are pin point size and do not give off very much light at all . the night light is optional and is at ground level and has a blue shade so that you have just enough illumination to walk and avoid anything in your pathway . 
regular u.s. house current 110 120 not sure if it 's compatible with euro standards . i do n't think it draws that much juice . 
made in china . 
china 
i do put mine in the dishwasher 
i believe some reviewers use it to rinse their mouths after brushing . i use it to store toothbrush 's 
yes . love these cups . perfect for the kids . 
no just one when i bought it . it is a great cup . 
not neatly , there 's alot of leftover bag . but i use regular bags . you canbuy the fitted ones for not that much more than the regular , but i 'd rather just get them at the store . i did buy the special bags for the small side . i use that side for trash and the big side for recycling . 
it takes their bags which say 35 liters for regular garbage and 18 for recycling . when this first arrived my initial thought was that this simply would not work . with a household of five and two dogs , i thought we 'd be emptying it several times a day . i was wrong . it 's compact on the outside but somehow we pack more inside and actually take it out less often than the standard 13 gal . kitchen receptacles . i did the math and the 35 liter bag converts to 9.4 gallons . i am a believer in this item since owning using it . it stays cleaner as well . i hope this helps . 
dear jeanne , the lid on this unit , which you are inquiring about is black plastic . if you would like a stainless steel lid , please follow the provided link : http : www.amazon.com simplehuman-rectangular-fingerprint-proof-stainless-12-gallon dp b001bvh794 ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1396291355 & sr=8-1 & keywords=cw1830 . best , simplehuman 
yes , a few of them too . oops ! i forgot that i switched sides . i use the trash side ( left ) for recycling and the smaller side ( right ) for garbage . 
yes . there is a handy cut out to hook your finger in and each section pulls out independently . also , you can use regular trash bags , even though they make ones that exactly fit the size . 
yes ! i just checked the bag sizes and that is the approx . size . i have to add that i love this system . i use the smaller side for garbage ( there are two of us and i am glad to get the smelly garbage out more often ) . you do not need to use their bags ( but it nice ) because there is a hole in each container for the knots if you want the bags tight . 
this one has a plastic lid . 1830 has a steel lid . 
its about 36 or 37 inches ... the height is 25 and depth is about 12 
that was my concern also . it is 35 '' h 
no . it has a blue recycle bin that comes out and since you probably will be putting somewhat clean recyclables , no bag is necessary . i just rinse it out when needed . 
sorry ... my folding board does n't indicate where it was made ... 
basically the buckle opens up and re-clasps 2x for thicker materials such as sweat shirts , etc . i tried the towels but it really is n't any better or faster than doing it by hand . but as far as t-shirts go it is awesome and my drawers now look all neat and uniform ... same size folds , have saved a lot of space ... but as far as towels go ... not any time savings . 
no , but it clips together quickly . the directions are easy to follow . it took me longer to fold my first shirt than to put this together . 
not much but it 's horrible . the first time i washed the comforter on cold , delicate cycle ( just as the instructions read ) the entire thing fell apart . all the company gave me was a 70 % refund on a comforter i ca n't even use ! it 's cheap do n't buy anything made by them . 
yes , it is pretty long on both sides , maybe a little shorted than the pictures with a pillow top mattress but not much . 
its a light and thin cotton material so not very durable but soft comfortable . 
i use the gentle cycle and it come out grat 
yes it is perfect for things like that- 
i find it remarkably quiet . in an office setting i am sure others would hear it , but only faintly . 
absolutely . the whisk attachment is amazing with the small stuff like that . 
no , i have used it for whipping cream , mashed potatoes , guacamole and drinks with ice . ! 
stainless steel , blade , shaft and housing . gasket surrounding shaft appears to be plastic . 
as long as there is sufficient liquid . i blend mostly frozen fruits with it . 
very easy . there are n't any nooks or crannies where things can get lodged and missed . probably the easiest way is to immerse it in some soapy water , and turn it on for a few seconds , then run it under clean water under the tap . 
not at all . very easy to use and comfortable to work with . it 's so quick you do n't have to hold it for very long at all ! 
the outer casing and blades are all stainless . the upper part is stainless except for the grip . it is very heavy duty . 
it fits into a normal drinking glass . i use mine in different containers including plastic and it works well . 
three inches approximately , the removedcore is about one inch . 
yes it is dishwasher safe . i am learning you need to make sure the pineapple is all the way off of it before washing it or it comes out with a piece if pineapple still on it . washed it in the dishwasher several times no problems . 
i have used it on various sizes and have found it works well on all of them . the only thing you have to watch is to make sure you do n't core too far through the base of the pineapple . it is an excellent product . 
yes but it 's pretty self explanatory 
you do n't cut all the way thru the bottom . when you get down to the bottom you move the handle and shaft around gently as you pull up on the handle and it finally comes out in one piece . the core is left in the pineapple . our horses love the remains . 
yes , i 'm not sure if she would be able to pull the slicer corer back when bottom is reached.it gets harder when the juices create some kind of vacuum and hold tight on the tool making it hard to remove . 
china 
near the black handle at the top of the tube , there are two squeeze buttons , releasing the handle ( mine is black ) . remove this and push the core out with a long handle spoon , the handle part , or shake the tube and push with finger to remove the core . 
melanie very pleased with product . sturdy and makes cutting pineapple an esse 
unknown , not indicated on box or on the actual product . go for it , seems well made and works well . 
it 's on amazon . 18 10 gorham is an excellent brand . i worked in their market research dept and am aware of what is meant by `` weight . '' it has nothing to do with how much the flatware weighs ; it is the percentage of certain elements used in the manufacture of the stainless . 18 10 is a better weight . 
yes , they are the traditionally shaped sort that feel right in the mouth and hand . they are especially heavy and bright -- after a year or so of use and dishwasher washing . 
yes , have washed them in the dishwasher with no problems . 
no , it was made in china . 
mostly metal . the trim around the edges is probably plastic . no cardboard or wood . 
it 's 28 1 8 '' tall . 
i think it could work . there is n't a real wide lip though . 
we only use it to play cards . however , it seems very sturdy . 
i do n't have it set up , but i measured the legs and added an inch for the thickness of the table top itself , and i got 28 '' . i also measured another card table that i do have set up and which i think is the same size , and i got 28 '' . so 28 '' + - and inch . i used it outdoors and it got rained on . the rain beaded up on the finish , but i 'm not sure the top did n't absorb from the humidity in the air , and it 's now a bit saggy in the middle . still quite usable , but thought you might want to know . 
no , the entire table is black . 
the resin top is very bumpy , not smooth . it really depends on how you want to use table . resin top not good for writing or dining , but it is very durable . 
i would not trust it for weight . i have a table you can get at staples , or bjs or costco that 's longer and much sturdier . this table looks great and has nice surface but it wiggles on a bare floor which is disappointing . fine on rugs . good for doing puzzles and games , and does look nice but i would not put a lot of weight on it . 
it is black . 
yes ... it 's quite heavy ... but i would add there is a very slight texture to the top 
slightly textured . 
it is completely sturdy for my purposes . i would n't want to sit on it , but i use it as a portable workbench for fine fitting of parts for assembly of black powder pistols . has been working great for me . flat ? the surface is slightly padded so it is not like a `` hard flat surface '' . you could n't use it as a drawing board , but it does an admirable job of staying parallel with the floor . 
not much . i had a small flat screen computer monitor , keyboard , and mouse on it and it bowed in the middle within a couple months . do n't waste your money . spend a little more and buy a better table . 
yes 
no , the legs are not adjustable . it stands 28 '' high . it is very sturdy . 
not very about the same thickness as a card table . the exact measurement is 1in 
it is almost 2ft 1 2ins . it 's 28ins total . perfect for a side table to store amp and all extras for that you need . would n't suggest to try and use for a dj set up to short 
i would say yes . 
it is light , yet sturdy . probably weight is listed in the details for shipping ... the leg clips are extremely tight when it comes to taking the table 'down ' ... 
20 '' wide , 48 '' long , about 28 '' high 
this pot is made in china . most of all clad is made in the us , but this is one of the few exceptions . 
the 6 quart pasta pot measures 9 inches overall ( both sections ) . the handle of the lid adds another inch . the height of the bottom pan only is 6.5 inches . 
yes 
the base is 7 inches . the internal diameter of the pot if approximately 8.5 inches . 
probably the closest in size is a 6 qt . stockpot . there are sauce pans that are made in the usa for which you can buy inserts . the issue is all-clad inserts are made in china .

yes 
stockpot measures 9-5 8 inches in diameter . insert measures 9-1 2 inches in diameter . pot capacity is 6 quarts ; insert capacity is 4 quarts 
it works very well for steaming vegetables 
the base itself is 7 '' but the pot quickly widens to 8 and 1 2 inches - could be a very tight fit . however , this is a great pasta pot ! 
no , it is n't painted . 
this looks like a very light dusty gray to me . i 'd say it 's like concrete . the one i ordered was the rainwater , it 's a very pretty , pale blue . 
in each of the four open shelf areas there are two circles in the back of the cabinet that can be pushed out to allow wires and cables to pass through to the outlets behind the cabinet . each circle is an inch to an inch and a half in diameter . i hope this is helpful . 
light grey . i luv it ! ! ! 
my drawers are set back . they do not stick out . 
the overall width of this unit is 51 inches . 
it 's a seafoam green . 
17 1 2 '' 
the height of the stand is 51 '' 
22 '' wide by 11.5 '' high 
each opening is 16 '' wide by 12 '' high 
granite is not a color option-there is cobblestone yellow and rainwater- i bought the cobblestone and it 's more gray in color than what the picture shows . 
17 inches high 38 inches long and 18 1 2 inches deep 
hello ! if you scroll down further they give you this information to you . product information ... .. : - ) 
it is a blueish green leaning towards blue- hop ethat helps 
sauder products have a laminated finish . you can not paint over the table if you do n't like it , sorry . 
sorry , i got the yellow . this color was perfect . 
39 1 4 wide x 19 1 2 deep x 18 high 
the dimensions are listed in the specs at bottom of page . 
it comes in rainwater , model 414155 and cobblestone , model 414158. bestfurniturebys 
39 1 4 wide x 19 1 2 deep x 18 high 
it 's a soft yellow like the picture . 
no drawers but a great coffee table . i repurposed it as a desk 
no 
21 '' x 12 '' x 6.5 '' 
it 's about 21 '' x 12 '' , and about 7 '' deep . 
it depends on how much ice you put in and what size beverage containers . last time i used it , i filled it with ice and put in about 16 beer soda bottles . 
the very top of the bookcase can hold 35lbs . the bottom of the unit can hold up to 30lbs . the two adjustable shelves can hold 25lbs . 
it 's a cooler green . i would n't call it bright - more like a seafoam green . there 's less blue than green , though so definitely not teal . i hope this helps ! 
depends on text books . but you can put books on it . not sure the measurement 
yes . 25 to 40 minutes depending on how mechanically inclined you or your friends may be . 
product dimensions : 35.3 x 13.5 x 43.9 inches ; 63 pounds 
the shelves are 29 1 8 '' wide and 11 '' deep . 
i do n't know . it 's sort of a thin formica-like veneer over some sort of pressed wood , i 'd imagine . the boards that form the sides , top , bottom and shelves are fairly thick and heavy . very heavy . the 'beadboard ' piece that forms the back is very thin , comes folded -- it looks nice but is not what i 'd call 'wood . ' that said i am very happy with these pieces . i ended up buying 14 of them to do a total makeover in my basement craft room and office and it 's been a year now ; they are perfect for my needs and very roomy and sturdy . whatever they may be made of . 
yes 
no , it 's just as pictured ... a creamy ecru color . 
it 's in the ad page but they are : product details color : cobblestone product dimensions : 39.2 x 19.4 x 18 inches ; 49 pounds 
yes 
laminate . it does not look like wood . it looks a little cheap to be honest . 
approximately 16 '' w x 12 '' h 
it was really easy to put together . i did it in less than an hour by myself . 
it is a light gray with a little taupe mixed in . right now sauder does not have a white coffee table in their line . 
it is more of a gray finish with a hint of taupe . 
i do n't see why not . it 's made of pressed particle board with a laminate . the laminate should cover nicely with a spray can or what have you . 
not really . i actually like the dish , but was a bit surprised at how small it was when it arrived . it looks much larger in the photo . i used it for a small bundt type cake and it could n't hold all of the batter from my normal cake recipe . 
i do n't recommend to use any type of glass on stove . 
i use this dish to bake pound cakes . my recipe calls for a total of 9 cups of combined ingredients . the batter fits the dish well and bakes beautifully , almost to the top of the dish ( rising during baking doubles the volume ) . depending on what you are baking and how much of a rise you expect , you should be able to use at least 10 cups of batter , or at least 12 cups of liquid for aspic or an ice ring . 
i'e had no problems with cakes sticking in this pan . i do use pam in it first . i love it . 
joec , not sure what your question is , but i 'll assume you 're asking if over sized pans work ? yes they do as long as they are induction compatible . we purchased a larger pan for making hot pots , and it works rather well . i do n't know if there are any differences in heat consistency on the edges of the pan since the coil does n't line up with the edge of larger pans , but we 've not noticed anything to difficult . as i 've said before , the fact that lifting the pan , say to flip turn the contents causes the unit to pause and you need to push a button to restart ... hope this helps . 
hi becky , i do n't know why not . the trick is in the material of your pressure canner . my understanding is that if you want to know if a pan will work on your induction stove , try to stick a magnet to the pan . if it sticks , it will work . i see no other reason why a pressure cooker would not function on an induction cooker . 
i think it will be fine with it . i used my staub dutch oven on it and it was fine . you might simply test it by placing your pot ( s ) on it with some water and start the burner . it will either work or it will e out . good luck . it is a great addition to the cooking realm . regards , jay 
you have to pay special attention to cooking on this stove . everything happens quickly . if you were making the fudge you were speaking of , i believe it would do a great job , you just can not walk away from it . for me it is the perfect stove i use it for everything . my old electric stove sits unused now except for the over . 
use the newave to make cheese , yogurt and beer . processes that require precise temperatures both low and high . what separated the nuwave from other burners is that it can keep temparture below 120f . some of the rescipies call for high temperatures , +190f , to kill unwanted microbes then holding a low temperature , 100f , to support wanted microbes . i uses an external temperature gauge as a backup and both reading always match . 
you can hear the fan for sure , but i do n't find it overly loud or noisy . the fan under my microwave is 100 times louder ... this is more like a small cpu fan ... . 
major difference between those 2 models is max power . nuwave pic can go up to 1300w and nuwave pic pro high powered can go up to 1800w . in practice it means that you will be able to cook `` faster '' with pro high powered model but in the same time you will need to make sure that the wiring for your kitchen outlet is 20a . if it is not the case you will face frequent pops of your fuse on this outlet or create fire hazard if installation is not done properly . just as a safety precaution manufacturer equips this kind of devices with special plug that will not fit regular 15a outlet . it means you will not be able to use it in a lot of places where there is no 20a outlet . i personally own basic version and it is sufficient for my cooking needs . nevertheless if you are power hungry you may look for 3000w induction cooktop from other makers . this kind of equipment will set you up for alteration of you kitchen wiring to 220v . in general it is not that difficult since the most american kitchen should be pre-wired for this possibility . 
the pan has to be magnetic . if a magnet sticks to the bottom of your pan it will probably work . pure aluminum and pure stainless steel pans will not work . most pans that will work on induction cookers will have `` induction suitable '' stamped on them somewhere . i bought a circulon symmetry pan and it works great . here 's a link for amazon 's circulon line ... 
1300 watts and 120 volts 
yes , the pans have to conduct a magnetic field so they have to be made of steel , cast iron , or one of their nuwave pans . 
the measurements of the flask are 3 and 3 4 inches wide ( straight measure ) and almost 4 inches tall ( straight measure ) . the flask has a slite bow to it and that makes the measurement a little harder to do . it does fit in most of my pockets real nice . 
yes it has a slight curve , it engraves very nicely . 
metal 
i 'm not sure ... . the finish is flat black and the metal wall is thin . it is a very nice flask as it is . 
i did not have mine engraved but the engraving probably would show up as shiney metal agains the dark and look very nice . 
hey marco , no problems so far for everyday use . although made it china , it seems to be a sturdy flask with a tight seal . the matte finish is a nice touch . hope this helps ! alex 
china 
yes ! very nice quilt for ) $ $ . very soft and not too thin . great quality 
the quilt has so many beautiful , earthy colors in it ; i prefer neutrals ( like cream ) , but if you want to go dark colors , you could get a warm brown , a maroon , a tealy-turquoise , deep mustard yellow or clay color ... there are a lot of options . you might want to wait until you have the comforter to see , and then decide ... i love mine ... the colors , material , weight are perfect . enjoy ! 
i have this set and it is definitely cream background . i paired this set up with some brick red sheers as well as other pillows on my bed . i also have a brick rug to match . there are other nice colors that you may want to pull out to accessorize with as well , but i like red so thats why i chose it . it is a nice set and i do recommend it . i really like the fact that its not extremely thick because i hates real heavy quilts because i am a hot natured person . 
yes it does . 
the stitching is .3mm long . 
it 's been a while since i bought this so i do n't know the dimensions but it was a fairly good sized box . the king is a very big quilt , i love mine and use it every fall and winter ! 
if you enlarge the picture , the color is pretty much `` right on '' ... .it is a blue green . puffs tissue has a 124-count striped box of tissues out and the wide stripes on that box is about as close as i could find for you to look at when grocery shopping . hope this helps . 
it does . i think it would work well . 
i love this quilt . yes , it does have orange tones . i believe it would go well with orange curtains . 
the prepac website lists a width for the queen size set as 107.25 '' . 
it must be mounted not only to a wall but to studs in the wall so i would recommend purchasing a stud finder with this item . 
no , just the headboard 
it comes in three pieces . the total length is 125.5 inches . the main part that goes above the bed is 78 inches long . the two parts that are attached to the nightstands are 23.75 inches each . 
this is only a queen headboard . it mounts on the wall . you can buy the matching platform bed or use your own bed frame 
well the headboard and nightstands all rest on the same `` track '' - you can hang the track at any height your want , but you ca n't hang the nightstands at a different level then the headboard . they rest perfectly next to it though 
we ordered a king size so do n't know about queen size 
it 's a board notched at the top so the headboard slides over it and `` hangs '' on it . the board is first mounted to the surface of the wall with screws into the vertical studs behind the drywall . be sure to check for level and mount it at the proper height . this is not difficult . after assembling the head board 2 people will be required ( one on each end ) to pick it up and slide it down and against the wall so the hanger on the back of the headboard catches the groove on the horizontal rail mounted on the wall . important not to over tighten the screws causing the groove to be squeezed and reduced in size causing the headboard not to fit the groove . again not difficult . i am very pleased with this head board and bed as it gives the room a very `` clean '' look . 
it 's basically just a hole to run wires down through , nothing fancy but it 's gets the job done and makes the installation look that much cleaner . 
i purchased the leggett & platt fashion bed group murray platform bed sold on amazon . it is very sturdy , and it looks great with the headboard . 
yes - the bed does n't attach to the headboard at all - we have a moveable base and no issues 
hi jack - i actually never opened it , and was unable to ship it back , any chance you are in the ny area , you can have mine at a reduced cost . 
106 lbs 
not sure off the top of my head read the description carefully it says somewhere 
r. luo the entire unit is held up by a long bracket piece that 's fastened to the wall studs . you then mount the center headboard piece in the middle and after you 've completed the nightstand assembly they mount on the sides of the long bracket piece . i have a high bed so i placed the top of the nightstand 35 '' inches from the floor . i completed one nightstand and measured the bracket insert location on the wall relative to the 35 '' inches i wanted the nightstand to sit , marked to spot and anchored the long bracket piece . 
hi ronnie , the queen headboard is 107.2 inches long . best regards , netrush 
you can see light through it . it 's semi opaque . 
very thin sheet of plastic . probably the thickness of about 5 sheets of paper . it is cut resistant . you can roll it up for storage . perfect for my needs . 
the cutting mat is a milky color but there is n't any problem seeing through it . if i were to print a screen copy of this internet page , i would n't have any problem reading the text through the mat ! the mat surface has a very mild texture and makes a good cutting surface . 
nope ! i had to look nsf up before i could answer . the cutting mat ( it 's not a board ) is free of any labelling whatsoever . 
no , it will slide . i have an espresso maker on it so it stays in place . it 's large so i do n't think it would slide real easy . 
the mat is smooth on both sides . i am very happy with it . i cut it to fit the chopping block top of my kitchen cart and it works very well for me . 
nope i felt like this is a good option 
i 've had both of them . the only difference i noticed was the intak has a ring right where the cap screws onto the bottle . it is for counting how many bottles you consume in a day . i did n't like it there . when you unscrewed the cap , you moved the dial . the tritan moves the counter ring to the very top . it no longer gets in the way and is easier to use . 
yes , it does ! 
yes ... .every 4 ounces to 20 ounces . that was never a requirement for me . i love mine since it never leaks in my bag and so quick to push , drink and close when in water zumba and water aerobics classes . 
no this bottle is not isulated 
yes . i bought it for my 7 yr old and she uses daily for school . 
no it does not have a straw but a perfect sized moth piece . 
it works like any other foam pump . you can use the stuff made for foam pumps or you can use regular liquid soap and dilute it 1:5 . 
yes . you push down on the top . 
not enough water vs soap ratio . dump some soap , add more water . hope it helps 
i use the soap that foams but i find that the dispenser sticks and is hard to use . the directions say to use any liquid soap and mix with water . i did n't like this result . 
you press down on the top and the entire `` white '' portion goes down as the soap dispenses . 
i give it a little shake when i first fill or refill it , but after that no shaking seems necessary for it stay mixed . 
yes- the clear bottom plastic part unscrews from the upper white piece . marking lines on the clear bottom piece show the fill lines of soap water . use a thin liquid detergent for the soap to work properly . the liquid gel hand soap type does n't mix well with water . 
i imagine foaming soap would work . but if you only have regular soap the bottle gives you the ratios to make foaming soap for the dispenser . 
yes it is . and it will showsome dirt over time ; however , that is almos talways immediately overcome by a quick wipe with the dr. bonner 's foam , itself . and about once a month i take 10 seconds with a touch of baking soda to refresh all three of mine . so , no problem here . 
no drip , it stays clean . 
bella answered on their website that this steamer is bpa free : http : www.bellahousewares.com countertop-electrics steamers black-food-steamer-13872 
i sent it back as it was to big to store ... .. l have black & decker had it for ages . i looked at so many others but they were flimsy . i like this so much l brought a spare one brand new at house sale . if l need more room l use both . great product ... . 
it says 07. love love love mine ! i steam my baby 's food in it , as well as healthy meals for my family . best 30 bucks spent . 
plastic , but it is really good quality . 
hi . thank you so much for contacting . i could not find the dimensions of 2 tiers . but the capacity of both of them combined is 1.25 quarts . if you have any further questions please feel free to ask . regards 
no , not that i can see from the pictures on the outside of the box ... it states on the box , `` removable bowls stack for compact storage '' ... '' includes 5-cup rice bowl , 3.5 liter steaming bowls featuring 8 egg holders each , and lid . 800 watts . `` ... `` two tiers for cooking multiple dishes at once '' ... hope this helps ! 
i do n't have any idea 
it is made of grade 2 titanium 
the straw is approx . 7 and one half inches long . the drinking part is 2 '' . the longer end is 5 1 2 `` long . hope this helps answer your question . 
there 's only one straw . honestly , now that i have it , i do n't regret buying it . i had some stainless steel ones that made drinks with strawberries taste metallic . this one has no `` taste '' to it . 
the titanium straws are made in china 
although i have not used in drinking hot coffee , the manufactured material would handle heat . the metal might heat up a little . i have used with cold coffee and it worked great , no coffee taste residing of course i cleaned first . 
it is what i would call standard length such as any fast food would have . 
measuring tip to tip it is 7.25 inches . hope that helps . 
1 4 inch in outer diameter 
no 
this will definitely last longer than a plastic straw . i do n't know how long a plastic straw lasts in your house , but in my house a good quality plastic straw is lucky to see 30 uses , even assuming i do n't let the children use it . this straw should last your lifetime . 
yes ... it fits in my 12oz bottles ! 
long enough to drink your beer ! 
all 3 are in 1 box . 
absolutely . 
one box ! tip ... ..the beer needs to be cold before you use these since they will not make the beer cold enough unless you like slightly cool beer and also you need to take a good swig out of the bottle before you insert it or else you will have beer spilling out . 
it 's plastic 
about 17 inches 
chair at widest point is about 4.5 inches but back arches so takes up just over 7 inches if you imagine wall to widest point . add a few inches as well because it must lean against so thing or topple over . when stacked they do not take up much room . you can view same similar chair at bed bath and beyond but cheapest on amazon . 
black 
i guess it would be possible . you would have to pry the seat off and it seems pretty secure . 
yes - every now and then , but probably not on an everyday basis . it 's a nice chair , sturdy , attractive , and great for that occasional big dinner party . 
yes ready to use 
17 inches at the front and 14 1 2 inches at the back 
yes 
chairs are very strong , you wo n't be disappointed . 
at least 200 # , likely close to 300 # . they have held up well for family gatherings . 
i am not sure of the weight limit , but we have some guys that are about 250 here and they have not broken them yet . : ) 
yes and they 're good chairs 
i 'm not sure if nesting is on top one on another . for that answer is no . they close and if all face the same side they fit well but not necessarily `` nesting '' just neatly put away 
it 's about 4 feet tall and the width of the chairs ; maybe 10 inches or so deep . i 'm writing this from memory but i can say it 's easy enough to handle and move around . 
i would n't leave them outside . the metal is painted and i 'm guessing they would n't be harmed if they were accidentally left out in the rain once or twice , but i would recommend using them indoors . the vinyl is not really outdoor material . 
metal to metal , width wise , is about 18 inches . the seat cushion is about 15 inches . 
no it does n't , it is not removable . 
16 ' off the ground 
it 's 14 1 2 '' from the ground to the bottom of seat . 
yes they do 
yes- i received two chairs for the 86.99 price . they are terrific chairs . nice looking and sturdy , easy to store . 
hi mary , underneath the chair it says safe weight limit 250lbs . hope that helps ... .. 
i do n't have the exact dimensions but they are very comfortable and sturdy . i am a large woman and am quite happy with them . i would guesstimate the width across the front at at least 24 '' and the depth at about the same . the seat is not square as it is a but narrower at the back . hope this helps .

18 '' hi . 
no 
there is a release and then the back of the seat lifts up . 
18 '' 
no - simply remove the packing . they are great ! 
at least 225 pounds . no one heavier has day or stood on it since i have had it . 
this crevice tool is 24 '' long . it can fit under stoves with some maneuvering . cen-tec systems offers another flexible crevice tool , the 38903 , which is longer at 36 '' and created for under stove cleaning . 
it will fit 1 1 4 '' hose end which the hoover has , it should work . 
do n't have a kirby . it is just a straight insert piece ... no special connectors . sorry i ca n't be more help . 
it fits a standard wand . do other standard attachments fit the animal ? 
sorry , i do n't have a miele canister . i know it fits nicely on my 2.5 gallon shop vac and my mighty mini shop vac hoses . i took a leap of faith that i 'd measured my hose correctly when i ordered this . so if you measure your canister hose and it is the same size , then it will more than likely fit . 
yes 
i do n't know anything about a bissell upright . mine attached to the hose of my vacuum cleaner , and it works great . 
dimensions : working end , 1 1 4 '' wide , 1 2 '' thick . 18 '' long . 1 1 4 '' inside diameter , fits hose with 1 1 8 outside diameter plug in . i use a beam and a shop vac ; works on both . if dyson plug in is 1 1 8 outside diameter , it will work . 
fits inside the hose end nicely , not outside as you would expect it to 
i ca n't say for sure as i do not have a miele canister vacuum cleaner at this house . i have an in wall vacuum system and it works with this type of hose . returning things with amazon could not be easier if it did n't fit . 
i 'd give it a 4. i have had the whistling sound happen but only when the suction regulator on the nozzle is slightly open . ( it does slide open fairly easily so -1 for that ) . i use it almost daily and it has worked just fine . i do n't find it particularly heavy or loud and it is much less cumbersome than the standard hose . it also does not get kinked or tangled like my standard hose does . the picture currently shows a metal nozzle and mine is plastic but it fits all the regular accessories . 
that should be fine since it is for low voltage or no voltage . the low voltage is at the door , and the 220 voltage is for the unit . this hose is for straight suction or turbo only . no power head . 
as long as it measures as a 1.25 '' inlet opening it will . thanks 
it worked with mine . 
my unit did not come with a remote . 
about 2.5 ' tall and about 18 '' wide.. this unit that we have works great ! ! 
i do n't see why not . i would n't leave it on while i 'm not around the area for long periods though , indoor or outdoor . 
yes some type of resin . hard to tell that it is . very happy with it for what we use it for . 
yes it does : ) 
it is made of wood : ) 
tight fit 
it plugs directly into.a.c.. 
it does have a fan , which is very quiet . this fridge can be used to make contents either hot or cold . 
yes it is great for an office with limited space . only wish it was a little bigger inside . can drinks fit perfect and keeps them cold . i have had no problems and have had it for almost a year . 
it is about 13 inches high , 12 inches deep ( from front to back ) and 12 inches wide . these are approx . dimensions for i threw the box away ! the inside dimensions are 9 inches high , 8 inches wide and 6 inches deep . the directions said to turn it off every 2 days for 1 hour , but someone wrote in and said his has been plugged in for a year and he never unplugged it at all and it works just fine . i bought this for my kindergarten classroom to keep my water and lunch cold . i hope this helps . 
do n't know the measurements . gave mine away . i could fit 5 or 6 bottles in there . 
it made a general hum , like any fridge , but not what i would call `` loud . '' more importantly ; mine stopped working after about 1 month . that would be my biggest concern . 
no 
13 '' hx11 1 2 '' wx 12 1 2 '' d 
yes a standard water bottle will easily fit 
in so far as i can tell , there is n't any kind of a thermostat to regulate the temperature . i would guess that it 's self regulating according to the room where it 's located . there is a switch that you set to use as a refridgerator or as a food warmer and the other switch is for either a c or d c indicating a house current ( a c ) or an automobile 's current ( d c ) . there are cables for both and that 's the limit of choices we have . i hope this helps . i am not an engineer -- -neither electronic nor choo choo . so far , this unit has performed quite well , and if it keeps up i will certainly recommend it to others . 
it 's not so loud but you can hear it . i got used to it after a while . i have it in the bedroom . it 's not so bad . does the job for me . keeps everything cool but not super cold . just cool . 
you dont have to turn it off after 48 hours , we have it running in our office 24 7 for almost a year now and it works great . 
it 's makes the sound of perhaps `` light air flow . '' i do n't think it will disturb anyone . it 's not completely silent but the sound is `` soft . '' 
plugs into the lighter slot and it comes with it . i'v never used it . i have mine at work . 
nope . there it 's a latch . 
we have only white 
i would not recommend this cooler . i got it for trips in the car and it failed miserably . the salad i was supposibly refrigerating was warm at the end of the trip . seemed to work when i tested it but failed sometime during the trip . have not used it since . 
it works great and it will hold 4 16oz . bottles of bottled water . it is a tight fit , but that 's all i needed it for . i use it in my classroom , and it works perfectly . it is very small though ! 
so i do n't get it , is this a queen or a twin mattress ? as elizabeth states , it sounds like a twin . 
queen size 
this is a queen . 
yes . they remove our mattress . 
nope just the mattress 
the number is : m18839.70.7904 best mattress i 've ever owned ! : ) 
sort of both . the top allows it to be soft but it 's also firm . love it . was unsure about ordering on line , but totally worth it 
completely sewn on , unfortunately . i carefully cut it off and because both the box and the label are black you ca n't really see anything 
it has a wood frame and its covered inside as well . i think it is very sturdy its used every day . great product 
13 '' x 13 '' 12 '' deep 
yes , will hold your weight . very sturdy . 
no . the lid is not attached . 
that 's what 's printed on them . and i 've used them in the microwave without apparent harm . 
indonesia 
yes , this set works well both in the dishwasher and microwave . btw -- i 've gotten many compliments on the colors -- they 're beautiful ! 
the dinner plates are 10.75 '' ; the salad plates are 9.25 '' . i think the previous commenter was unlucky in getting a bad set somehow ; i pour boiling water for tea into the mugs all the time with no sign of damage so far ( several months ) . 
very pale , greenish blue . ( very ) slightly darker toward the edge of the plates & tops of the bowls & mugs . 
the bottom says `` fine china . '' i actually think the pieces are rather heavy . 
we have a queen bed but have not had any problem with wobble . we love them . i recommend you try them . 
that raises the bed 5.25 inches . posts or casters fits up to 2.75 inch diameter . 
they nest rather than stack ... .i have seen some that reverse for a different height , but not 12 inches 
it depends on the size of your bed legs . if they fit on top it is 6 inches but if they fit inside it is 5 '' . 
up to 3 '' .. standard dorm bed post size 
no . not recommended . designed to work with legs of a stand , box spring would slide . very unsafe . 
i have no idea how much weight they would hold , the manufacturer would have to answer to that question . but i will tell you that my bed frame , my two twin-size box springs with built-in wooden drawers plus the weight of my mattress plus the weight of two people approximately 300 lbs total and these risers do n't budge . i 've even taken a flying leap onto the bed , and nothing moves . the only thing you might want to consider ? it 's going to put your couch up pretty high . aesthetically , it might look a little ridiculous . but the solid construction of these risers seems pretty sound to me . hope this helps . 
about seven inches by seven inches 
the top opening is a 2 & 5 8 inch square opening with rounded corners . almost 3 4 inches deep recess . 
i really would not . these are for more for stationary items . even then , our bed seems a little unstable , but that is due to how high up these put our bed . if you put them on a glider i can only imgine the rocking back and forth force , will cause the whole thing to topple over . 
it did not cover well on my king mattress , i have since gotten a queen bed and am using it on a queen bed now and still need a bed skirt . 
i bought it to use the cream side , which is nice , the under side is a dusty pink or dusty mauve 
i ended up giving it to someone along with the bed so i do n't have it anymore but it was plenty big for a queen bed if you use a dust ruffle . of course , my bed was high off the ground also . 
they are true to the advertised dimension . thank you 
the dimension of the queen is 90 '' x90 '' . please use this dimension as a guide to see if the quilt will work for your need . thank you 
it is ivory and a very soft salmon color . not gray or brown at all 
i sent it back it would n't even cover the bed , very thin material i would n't recommend it . 
it 's a pale spa blue and the reverse is a neutral taupe 
this is a quilted bedspread with two matching shams . it could be used as a quilt , although i do not . i found the spread to be shorter than the drop shown in the picture and combined it with a bedskirt . it 's too long to be classified as a coverlet and too short to be a hit-the-floor bedspread . it lacks about 4-5 '' all around to hit the floor . hope my answer helps . 
i would n't even try to microwave it . the honey in mine crystallized and when i tried to pull open the lid it broke . that is how delicate the pot is . it is blown glass and very breakable . 
hello . i want to say that it holds 15 ounces . mine is about half full right now and weighs more than 1 1 2 lbs . the pot is very light when empty . i hope this helps , it 's hard to weigh it when it 's half full and get an accurate answer for you , but i do know that the pot when empty is very light . 
made in china . 
glass , but it is beautiful for a tea setting with adults or people who are careful . please note you do not need to be very careful and it works well . 
washes fine - seems to hold its shape fine and materialstill feels soft . 
yes its true to size and does n't hang on the floor . i use it as a comforter also 
no 
black stitching on the black side , white stitching on the white side . 
no- shams are black . but backside is white - lighter material that is obviously back side , so not really reversible 
all dehumidifiers will heat up the air , it 's a fundamental physics bit about how they work . the measurement can be effectively correlated by the efficiency of the unit , and as such this one is pretty good according to consumer reports . i do n't have a second model to compare this to , but can say it 's heating up the air ~15 f roughly . i 'm using it in a 500 sq ft apartment , and if left on all day it will raise the apartment ~5 degrees . it also dropped the humidity of the apartment from 70 % to 35 % overnight , so no complaints . and it 's more quiet than the ac , which i now can use less often . 
i did n't notice the increase 
yes . i have mine sitting close to a drain and use the hose that was included . 
the maximum wattage is 500 w . 
my danby fan runs until it is slightly under the humidity level set and then shuts off until level rises again . 
sure does ... . 
i 've only had mine for about six months but i have n't heard of a recall . 
yes on both of your questions ... ... .we are extremely happy with our unit ... ... ... . 
i unplugged my unit to test it and it came back on . i believe that the on off switch has to be physically depressed to turn the unit off , so it should come back on when power is restored . 
someone already answered this just above you . this was the top one , i think : i unplugged my unit to test it and it came back on . i believe that the on off switch has to be physically depressed to turn the unit off , so it should come back on when power is restored . 
this unit has an outlet for a hose attachment . a short plastic hose is provided or you can use a garden hose . 
approximately 12 inches wide , 11 inches high and 7 inches deep . the bucket is oddly shaped so it fits snugly into the housing so this is approximate . it is relatively easy to remove . dumping is made easy with the recessed handle that pulls up for use . 
it 's threaded to fit a regular garden hose . 
yes there is a drain in the back that you can hook up a hose to . 
the washable filter is located in the front of the dehumidifier behind the air intake grill above the water tank drawer . remove the water drawer in the lower front of the machine and you can reach up just inside the cover and grasp the edge of the filter . pull it out and notice the side that faced the front of the machine . i then put the filter under a sink faucet with the side that faced the front of the machine downward so the water easily flushes out the debris - usually dust . a good shake and it can be reinstalled and the drawer replaced . how often ? i have had the filter filthy in a week and clean after a month . it depends on the environment . the recommendation is every 2 weeks and that is probably where you should start - and adjust the frequency based on your experience . 
in canada . 
it was a little loud if in the same room with a tv . sort of like white noise . i had major problems with leaking . the auto shut off when fill never worked so when full it flooded . also it clogged often and flooded the floor . it worked well when running . if you drain into a sink with a hose , you will love it . i had to empty the bucket and i finally gave up and got another brand after so many floods was damaging my wall . 
about 12 ounces 
yes , its not clear ( lens ) but it actually is as if the lens has a outdoor filter lens which you can see through . well made , really real looking , dishwasher safe and an actual thermos . 8oz i would think . a nice gift or for yourself . was impressed actually with the item . 
no nothing moves on the cup ... 
no , the base is plastic 
the lid is designed to look like a real lens . adding a drink hole would clearly take away from that . however , the lid does have a good seal therefore allowing you to travel safely with it . use it for soups or something for lunch ... or simply drink coffee cocoa tea etc at a table . it really does look better than the picture & is neat to have use . 
run it under hot water . it happened to me to . 
yes you do , but be sure you read completely , these are `` lens cups '' not real lens ' i have two of them i love the one i have . and send one to my camera guy who helped me pick out my camera . he really loves his . d 
maybe 5 inches ? i gave it as a gift , so ca n't measure it now ... 
there is no `` drinking lid '' . i think that sometimes the chinese manufacturers will copy descriptions from other similar products , but do n't speak the language well enough to know the difference . : ) i 'd make the same mistake or worse , for sure . : ) for what it 's worth , i love this product . but i did find the exact same cup for $ 7.99 from another seller . the cool thing was , i ordered 7 of them , but they only charged shipping for one ! i drilled a sip hole in one lid and it works great ( needs a small hole on the opposite side of the lid to let air out ) . hope this helps . sincerely doug 
dear kenneth , thanks for asking . this item is shipped from china . in this busy christmas season , free shipping may need 7-20 days , fast shipping via dhl make take 5-10 days . waiting for your order . regards , beyondtrade 
yes , i think it can ... 
its a complete cover , not a pad . there is no pillowcase cover 
thanks for your question ! you can request a replacement using our online returns center here : 
no , it is not cotton because it is water and fluid resistant . it is a synthetic but it is not 100 % vinyl . it is zippered . i have seen several types and like this one the best . our pest control guy recommended covers in general since we rent out several furnished apartments and a good offense is a must . he cautioned that this does not mean you will not get bed bugs but only that they will have fewer places to hide . 
no its not 
i have never had a problem with this product , however if you check out the packaging there is contact information and instructions on how to proceed in the event of an issue . you can always contact the shipper for this information also . hope this helps . 
yes it is . and a vecro on tab end so it doesnt unzip , , its nice you dont know its there , like you do with plastic 
seems to be like polyester . it has a coating on inside . 
the fabric ... .not sure ! but for fleas and bed bugs also ticks ... it is the very best you will buy ! ! ! i sleep like i 'm still in my mother 
i am not sure , but i do n't see a reason why it should n't . 
yes it will fit . 
its like a poly-blend type material . like the other person answered , it does n't make.noise , its more like cloth . its also quite durable . hope that helps . 
no . they do n't come in sets . you have to order them separately . i needed a dust-mite , allergen free and bed bug proof pillow covers ( 1 ea . ) and ordered them in addition to the mattress cover . hope this answers your question . 
better than the frigidaire at 50f about the same at 70f 
made in china by a canadian usa company . 
it does n't go by temp . it goes by how much humidity you have in your house . the dehumidifier will run down to temps of 45 degrees . humidity in a house should be between 30 - 50. set the humidity gauge on your dehumidifier to the amount of humidity you want in your house . i set mind at 40 and according to a separate temp humidity gauge it is usually about 37 . 
yes , i do n't see why not . however i just gravity drain with mine . 
hi beverly , the recall is only for the units made for the canada market . this is a copy of the information i received from my distributor and danby . on september 12th a voluntary recall of dehumidifiers built by gree electric appliances inc. of zhuhai , china was announced by the consumer product safety commission . of the 2.2 million units affected by this recall , a single danby model of less than a 1000 units was included . this model was sold to a single us retailer but had not been placed on the retail floor . since that time all inventory has been accounted for , quarantined and is in the process of being returned to danby products inc. affected models : danby model brand upc ddr4511 danby 67638 90285 4 danby usa does not actively source and sell dehumidifiers from gree for the united states market . gree manufactured dehumidifiers are sold through our canadian division . to clarify , none of the dehumidifier products we sell into the united states market are supplied by gree . therefore none of our united states distributors , retailers , or consumers will be impacted by this recall . consumers should not be concerned about danby branded dehumidifiers they purchased from retailers in the united states . this recall does not affect them . '' please let me know if i can help you with any other concerns . sandy wray , owner best kitchen products 
sounds like a window ac unit . so not bad but not quiet 
yes 
i have confirmed one difference , the rated water collection in 24 hours is 60 pints in the ddr60a3gp and 70 in this ddr70a2gp . also , there are several reviewer comments and question responses that state that this ddr70 does shut off the fan as well as the compressor in contrast to the c.r . unfavorable comments about the continuous run of the ddr60 . 
it 's a regular garden hose connection like i 've always found on houses . it 's plastic but connected solidly to my hose and has n't leaked . 
hi sue we have had absolutely no problems with this dehumidifier which runs constantly in our basement did n't see anything freezing or frosting up but does a great job i do recommend it highly 
i was wondering about that too but , it is great ! i love it ! ! ! 
i asked tuft and needle about the `` foldability '' of their mattresses before purchasing and they said that while they do not fold in three like traditional shikibuton , they can fold in half . this was their response : `` the tuft & needle five mattress can be folded in half , from head to foot , but , it needs some help to stay there . due to the resilient nature of the mattress , it would `` pop open , '' without something to hold it down , though a couple heavy books will do the trick . i 'll link a photo and video demonstrating : https : www.dropbox.com sh xrjc8bax8tdagf0 aabenjgl2pfieunkrr1fieeza # lh : null-_mg_6570.jpg https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=ssw1fwgirhm & feature=youtu.be '' if you have n't bought your mattress yet and would like $ 50 off , you can use this link : https : www.tuftandneedle.com r bhpgcl3p it will also get me $ 50 off of my recent order , so we would both win : ) 
we have had ours 6 months or so and they are the same as when we got them . we use an ikea frame with a solid piece of wood underneath and i honestly do n't expect much change at all . my mother in law just stayed with us ( she is a pretty large woman ) and swears it is the best sleep she has had in years and plans to buy one . 
i have mine , 10 '' cal king , on a solid platform . more support , smaller gaps between slats , would be better and probably be more comfortable in the long run . 
according to t & n 's website specs page , the full mattress measurements are 54 '' x 75 '' x 5 '' and it weighs approximately 33 lbs . https : www.tuftandneedle.com bed specs 
we 've only used it on a regular bed frame , but i do n't think it would be pliable enough to be folded up to be the back and bottom cushions of a futon . 
i got a set of fitted sheets from target that said they were for mattresses up to 8 '' high . there is quite a bit of material that is under the mattress , but the top is smooth and i no longer have the fitted sheet coming off the mattress like i did with my old bed . 
is more firm then memory foam . better support . i use it for last few months and we love it it . 
yup we use it directly on the floor and it 's super comfy . 
we bought a king mattress and the regular king size sheets fit fine ( not deep or cal king ) and we have a king size mattress topper on as well . everything fits nicely . 
this is a classic-style foam . it is my understanding that t & n has a special manufacturing process for this kind of foam . it 's not like what i have tried on cheaper foam mattresses , as it 's quite supportive . 
hi laurin , our beds are free of pbdes as well as boric acid . our cotton-bamboo cover is quilted with a rayon blend that is inherently inflammable . this rayon is blended with sand and a small amount of polyester . 
i think protection is always a good idea when aimed at prolonging the life and usage of any investment . 
our beds could fit in a futon couch frame if the dimensions are the exact same . however , our beds are not able to easily fold up in half horizontally because of the firmness of the bed . 
it should be just fine . we use ikea frames with plywood as the base under the mattresses and love them . your set up would basically be the same , just not elevated on a bed frame . 
6'3 '' x3'3 '' . however depending on your sleeping situation it may feel smaller . mine is on the floor , so it feels a bit smaller simply because i have a large pillow . but if you plan on putting the bed in a frame , then you should be fine . normal twin sized sheets fit without any issues . 
thankfully , neither mattress i 've bought has had any odor emanating from them . we love our beds ! ! 
from the company 's website : `` our fire barrier is rayon cellulose fiber blended with fine-grained sand and a small amount of polyester which , in combination , are inherently fire resistant . tested and verified by an accredited lab to fully comply with flammability standards . '' 
no 
i think a 5 inch would be suitable for a daybed , as typically a daybed is for a child ( or someone weighing less than an adult ) or for guests . we have a 10 inch for our bed ( 2 adults ) and i would not have chosen any less for adults to sleep on every night . 
hi ! our beds can be folded in half . so for a twin-xl mattress , the folded dimensions would be 39 '' x 40 '' x 10 '' . 
if adjustable base you mean one with the ability to raise the head and feet sections separately i would say possibly , though probably not ( it depends on the base ) . the mattress itself is fairly flexible so bending it is not much of a problem , though it may be too light and would not sit properly if the bed was adjusted . if the adjustable base is built with weak supports and straight bars you might find it uncomfortable ( i am thinking of a fold-out bed in a hide away couch here ) . on the other hand , the mattress is a premium high-density foam mattress and some adjustable bases are designed to work perfectly for these . while the manufacturer recommends you use a flat , solid base or the floor ( they do work great if you like minimalist furniture living ) i so think that it would work fine for any bed that can use a high-density foam mattress . a good rule of thumb is that if the foam mattresses from ikea could work in the base , this mattress should also work fine ( and cost half as much as the equivalent mattress from there ) . 
i sleep on my stomach or side and i can safely say this is the most comfortable mattress i have ever owned . i would n't think your brother would have any problems . if it did n't turn out to be a comfortable solution , tuft & needle would probably pay for return shipping and refund your order ( but i 'd email their customer service just to check ) . they 're quick to respond to emails and show a real dedication to ensuring their customers are happy . 
currently i have it on a tile floor and the most important way to keep it clean is to clean your floor regularly . i recommend using something along the lines of a swiffer , as they are good at cleaning the floor without worrying about polish or wax getting on the mattress . beyond that , a decent mattress bag is a great way to keep it clean . you could also use a second bed sheet as a `` rug '' for the mattress or even a much larger sheet that you would wrap around the mattress completely . the mattress is also very durable , so you can take it onto your patio and beat the dust out of it like a rug without too much worry if you prefer to not wrap it . i 've found the most convenient route , though , is a decent mattress bag and cleaning the floors regularly ( which , in fairness , you should do anyway ) . 
i do n't see why you would n't be able to use the box spring . i 'm using two painted pallets for my xl twin bed . enjoy your bed . 
i 'd say your best bet is to measure your current bed - then if you look on tuft & needle 's website you can compare it to the measurements they have listed for each bed size . : ) 
i do n't think i would recommend it . it would be a pretty awkward setup with this one being heavier and firmer than a foam topper . 
i would get the extra long if i were you . 
the temperature of the mattress is same as any other mattresses . 
hi julie , the measurements of the twin xl are 3'3 '' ( w ) * 6'8 '' ( l ) * 5 '' ( h ) . our beds are made to normal bed dimensions , and we do not offer any custom sizes at this time . thank you for reaching out ! 
you can order all sizes and ( 5 '' or 10 '' thick ) from their website : https : www.tuftandneedle.com you can directly order from their website ( same free shipping and return policies ) 
i contacted tuft & needle about the bed frame displayed on their website to see if it was available for purchase . kelly responded and advised that the frame was a prototype and not available at this time . she gave me the web addresses to couple of companies that make similar frames : haikudesigns.com and tatamiroom.com . the frames from those two companies were out of my price range , but they all look very nice . i found a basic solid mahogany platform bed frame from the charles p. rogers website that i am going to buy . i 've never heard of the company , but all the reviews mention that their product is very high quality . this is the bed frame i am going to purchase : http : www.charlesprogers.com solide-platform-bed-p-392.html ? cpath=31_155 one thing i like about this frame is that the platform is level with the frame and appears to be some kind of upholstered deck instead of wooden slats . 
hey ! i use luna premium hypoallergenic 100 % waterproof mattress protector - 10 year warranty - made in the usa - and love it . wash it when you first open it ( like most things wrapped in plastic - yuck ! ) and then it 's great . about once a month to six weeks i take it off and wash it , too . no bleach , medium-low on the dryer . http : www.amazon.com gp product b002aqnxr4 ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk 
firmer , but this is not a memory foam mattress . it 's similar to a futon mattress . 
any mattress covers do not come with the mattress . i use a mattress protector on the mattress , then use a fitted sheet on the top , so that i do not leave any stains on the mattress ! 
i ca n't remember exactly , but it 's about 1.5'x1.5x5 . ' it 's vacuum sealed and needs a couple of hours before you sleep on it to expand . 
i asked the same question and was told normal sheets -- - it 's true ! fitted sheets fit right on like a mattress , so if you order a full size t & n bed , use full sheets . 
mine arrived in a package that was about as long as the mattress was wide , and was maybe 12-18 inches square in profile . they vacuum pack the mattress and it takes up a lot less space than you would expect . it is packed about like a giant poster . 
derrek h is correct . there are no springs in the mattress , so it will not sink at all . you can vary the `` give '' of the bed by choosing a bed frame base . if you put it on the ground or a solid base it 's going to have very little flex . use a wood slat frame to get some flexibility . 
the airflow for the mattress is superb , well around build as a memory form mattress . i used to sweet on my back during sleeping on regular springs mattress but this my issue now is reduce . as for airflow , you do n't have to do much to it . 
it comes in a cardboard tube . reasonably well protected 
i would pitch it between 165-175 gsm . framed it the moment it arrived so impossible to say how durable it is ... what are you intending to do with it ? as a poster , framed or not , it is as durable as any other poster if looked after properly . 
i do n't see why you could n't roll it back up and put it in the tube it came in- easy transport that way 
the machine comes with a little booklet and a measuring cup . the booklet has some recipes and indicates how many cups you need for each kind of milk . for instance , to make a litre of soy milk , you need one cup and a half ( included measuring cup , not a regular cup ) of soy beans . you can also add less water and have a thicker milk . for almonds you have to add a bit more or you will get watery milk . the booklet helps a lot but with practice you will determine how you like it . 
yes it is . it is very easy to use and makes great milk . the only issue we have is we like to run four batches one right after the other . the previous model would do that with no problem . this one we can only do two one after the other then we have to let it cool completely before we can run the next two . we have also found that we get a higher milk yeald with less waste if we put the finished product through our blendtec blender before we strain the milk . 
the g4 only works with 110v power supply . no 220v model 
yes 
the outside gets warm but not hot . 
you can do both . if you have soaked soy beans , then you select the `` soaked beans '' option ; if not , then select the `` dry beans '' option . both have worked for me well . 
yes . i make a batch a day . but you must clean it immediately . pour and filter the milk , then clean the unit . it is no problem to get at it to clean . 
no 
g4 machine with flowers is smaller than g4 stainless steel . 
from floor to the top surface of the bed is 11 '' . 
the platform edges are flimsy , and the instructions were nearly impossible to read . the pre-drilled holes were also drilled wrong and uneven ... .all in all a terrible buy because of the hassle . if the box was n't destroyed on shipping i would have sent it back ! ! ! 
hello lisa , thank you for your interest in this south shore step one platform bed . yes , for sure ! you can find the instructions on our website , www.southshorefurniture.com . if you are having trouble finding them on our site , you can always call our customer service , it will be our pleasure to send you them by email . for additional information , feel free to contact our customer service at 1-800-290-0465 or visit our website at www.southshore.ca : ) 
yes , there is one part that completely stays inside the wood , all pieces are labled . just be careful , take your time , and keep the instructions above all . 
hi , this item comes in two boxes and is ready-to-assemble . in these circumtsances , i would say that you should be able to carry it upstairs with tight turns . 
this does n't come with a mattress boxspring , the only thing you are ordering is the platform ( you should n't buy it if you do n't want the platform ! ) . sorry if i misunderstood you . 
no way mine can definitely hold 2 people . i have a huge mattress and it with 2 people it does perfectly fine 
the bed frame is about 1 ' in height , and 82 '' x83 '' 
these are not slats . there are full boards on this bed . you would have a 3 foot high bed , but i guess if that 's what you want to do , you could do it . 
it does not 
no this is a duvet cover - it snaps on the bottom and you place a twin size blanket inside - granddaughter loved it and had real good service , comes from great britain ! 
it is a coverlet ... has the texture of a sheet but is double sided and thicker for warmth . kind of both . 
this is equivalent to a twin size in us with measurement of 198 x 137 cm . 
this is a twin size with measurement of 198 x 137 cm . 
i have n't tried it on a serrated knife yet . but it works great with standard edge 
yes , it will work with just about any type of knives . 
i use it with all my knives . you will love it . 
it is just the carrying case you must supply your own knives 
it has a built-in brief case designed for your knifes . great for going to work school catering . you can put your lap top books or uniform in it it 's . great 
it holds 8 to 10 knives . 
yea it will

i would so soak it for about 1 min and a half before using it and then after a few passes with the knife i would do it for 30 seconds just to keep the stone wet and for a smoother pass with the knife 
both 
yes , i use oil on mine . would also suggest the 3000 5000 , to get your knives razor sharp . 
7 '' x 2 & 1 4 '' x 1 '' . hope that helps 
i do n't know where it is made , but it does a very nice job . i use it to sharpen my straight razor and am happy with it . 
yes it could be as long as you keep your stone good and wet and free of collectingdebree . make sure to take your time 
yes ; using it without thoroughly soaking it first will damage the stone and or your knife .

i bought mine at costco in 2011. i used in the states for 2 years now using in new zealand . i am no professional chef by any means but i am a physician . i was especially concerned about the coating so i checked out the ptfe i am real comfortable with it . it is the same product used in heart stents so i am real good with it . this non-stick system is more durable then anything i have used . i know good quality when i see it and use it and this definitely rates a 5 star in my book . 
yes . i have scratches on mine and they do n't affect the non-stick at all ! 
sorry i returned them cuz thy started to peel from the inside 
so sorry cont remember..i am taking them back to costco n ordering life time from regal ware 
yes , just like opening a jar 
yes it does , fits right in the top . 
there are n't holes but there is an air gap between the top and bottom which produces an amusing sort of vacuuming action , like it 's being sucked down through the bottom . hope that helps . 
i tested that . it foamed quite a bit . 
`` passes the fda food grade material approval . made of acrylic , and stainless steel the aerator comes with a no-drip stand . '' 
no no noise when you use it . 
you can use it for all wines , but i do n't see the point of aerating white wines . it 's mainly red wines that need aeration . 
this product was made in the united states.do not know what state.i love this aerator for the price you can , t go wrong great purchase.. 
vinara wine aerator works best with red wine and you can really notice the difference in smell and taste . 
i do n't know where it 's made nor can i compare it to vinturi as i have n't used that . however , i am very pleased with the aerator and have even given it as a gift . i 've been using it for months now and it 's highly durable ( not that aerating wine is a rugged job ) ! 
no it ca n't . the shelves are bigger than they look . you can get quite a bit in there . the bottom door has 2 shelves which holds 6 -8 med to bottles of shampoo on top and 5 very large ( costco size ) on bottom shelf . cubbies are a bit smaller -good for things such as 8 bars of boxed soap etc ... . hope i was of help btw top door contains a bit more space and 2 shelves 
hi , mason , no . it is pretty much what you see . interestingly , the shelves have a slight cut-out at the inside point of where the door swings when the door is opened . other than that , it is a straightforward cabinet - all the `` wood '' is thin , but , you most likely wo n't be putting anything very heavy or large in on the shelves . for your and your family 's health , i would suggest you open the box package outside , if possible . there is always a very strong smell of formaldehyde in on furniture that comes from asia , i suspect , because of pests that may hitch a ride on the boat . leaving it outside for awhile and washing it down with hot water and mild detergent should do the trick . 
it 's 9 1 2 . 
no ... and the assembly instructions are pitiful . however , once assembled , it works and looks great . 
yes . 
i do n't think it would hold up with heaven cans . it 's meant for bathroom storage . the shelves are pressed board , not wood , held in by plastic plugs . 
each compartment had two shelves . top shelf is 10 1 2 in tall x 81 2in d x 8 in w. bottom shelf is 10 3 4 in tall 81 2d x 8 in w. compartment sizes are identical . hope this helps . 
both the legs and top crown pieces are about 3 inches tall . you do not have to attach either if you do n't want to . the top railing is a pain tip put together , so i left it off . 
i 've not tried it , but as long as you make holes on the opposite sides for the connectors , i do n't see why you could n't . 
only white from what i saw . would be easy to paint though if necessary , probably take less then 30 minutes . 
i got this a month or so back and according to the tag it is `` 60 % cotton and 40 % polyester and fill is 100 % polyester '' . hope this helps ! 
comforter , sheets , 2 pillow cases , 2 pillow covers for display . my grandson loves the set . 
no . i have it on a full size bed and it is not long enough on the sides . 
83 '' x74 '' approximately 
neither . we received black ones with the star wars logo . 
the only drawback is that this model is only 1 speed , otherwise this handle works fine with my 4736 charger . 
i 'm not sure what you mean by a round guide but this model has a key shape that fits in the holder and the bottom is round . hope that this helps 
as the listing states this item is for models types 4729 
yes 
sorry , but i ca n't answer this one . 
it 's a regular size lunch box . you can fit lunch , beverage and snacks 
yes , the material is washable . i have taken a soapy cloth to wipe the inside and outside , no problem as of yet , just wipe down with clear water if soap is used . 
yes . 
i purchased the full size platform bed and ordered the full size memory foam mattress . the mattress fits perfectly and the built in box spring will allow for a shorter mattress . 
to be honest i do n't know . i bought this for a friend in az . 
it 's black . also it 's a pain in the rear to out together with less than desirable instructions . 
hi , thanks for your question . i was only able to find the overall dimensions of the full and queen sized beds . they are 81,5 '' l x 57 '' w x 40 '' h for the full bed and 86,25 '' l x 63,75 '' w x 40 '' h for the queen bed . in this case i 'd suggest that you contact the seller , new century home decor , directly for the inside dimensions . you can do this by clicking on `` contact the seller '' in the bottom right corner of their storefront page : 
not happy with what i received.. 
its made of polyester not actual micro-suede , it just feels like it . polyester is machine washable . i would recommend light wash in cold water to prevent any color running . also you might want to was the sheets separately from the comforter . 
yes with room to spare 
depth of the can rack is 11-5 8 inches front to back along the side frame ; so yes , it will fit ok on a pantry shelf of 11-1 2 inches depth . be aware that the lip of the shelf rack protrudes about 1-1 2 inches forward beyond the side frames ( total depth from lip to back of rack frame is just over 13 inches ) ; so if your pantry shelves are behind a door having less than 1-1 2 inches of space between the door and the shelf front , the door likely will collide with the lip of the shelf rack , and will not close completely . i have the can rack mounted on a shelf that is about 16 inches in depth , with the lip of the can rack protruding beyond the edge of the shelf . this gives me a space of just over 4 inches behind the can rack , which i can use to stack other stuff . 
if stacked on their sides , the cans can be set up to roll forward when the front can is removed . ( transverse rails which separate the rows of cans are moveable adjustable ; and if adjusted tightly against the can row are capable of preventing forward movement . ) the design is flexible , in that ( depending upon size ) cans can be stacked , rather than placed sideways in rows ; stacked cans usually will not move forward . 
no , they 're not really designed for that ; the back has additional wire support to give the structure more stability , not leaving enough room to load from the back . that said , these have been very good organizers for us . 
yes we have two stacked and its just great 
sure would ! the rack may not fit in the fridge however . 
i only load it from the front since the back is against the wall . since it holds 4-5 cans , it 's not a big deal to take existing ones out so you can put newer ones in back 
i pushed two of mine together and still needed an inch . they sit on legs , so if one hung over it would not be level . although it might work , it would be diffult to get cans out . i would n't take the chance . 
no 
the assembled rack is 13 5 8 '' tall at its ' highest point . cans the size of campbell 's soup ( 10 3 4 oz ) , on the top shelf , will still be under the highest edge of the rack . 
if the wires of your wire shelves are laid out left to right the racks will work very well because the bottoms of the sides of the rack are solid front to back . if your shelves have wires front to back , you would have to put some kind of a base under the racks to make them stand up the way they are supposed to for the cans to gravity feed . 
all the bowls nest together into the largest bowl . the largest lid can be placed on the largest bowl and the remaining unused lids placed within the top well of the largest bowl . they are located together very neatly . the largest lid also has metal graters that can be placed in the cutout of the largest bowl , a unique feature . when not using the grater , a matching circle insert is provided . it forms a tight seal . the sides of the interior has 4 measurement indicators , cups , liters , quarts , and oz . hope this helps . kat lady 
i just tested one out for you and i 'm impressed ! i filled the smaller bowl with water and poured it out very slowly and it dribbled straight down into the other container . i 'm really impressed with these bowls . just noticed too that there are measuring lines inside the bowls . i do n't think you can go wrong with this set of bowls ! 
i think its comes with a 1 year warranty but there pretty strong bowls , i had them for almost 5 years and no problems 
it 's rolled & comfortable . no sharp edges to cut yourself on thankfully . 
yes 
the bowls have a non-skid material around the outside bottom so i do n't think they would work as a double boiler . the material is probably silicone as the description says they can be used in an oven . the boiling water for a double boiler should n't hurt the non-skid material , it just would n't transfer heat very well . as far as freezing goes that should be ok and the non-skid material should help keep the bowl cold . 
yes . i have n't used the covers much , but i have them , and i checked one , and it seems very tight . maybe even turn it upside down tight . 
etched marking and 18 10 
hi , there are some inaccurate responses to this question . the lids are in fact bpa free just like the entire vonshef range . many thanks , designer habitat 
yes 
this item comes with 2 pillow cases 
i 'm not sure . i still have not received it . i think it is being shipped from overseas . no tracking is available and the first shipment got lost in the mail . i am actually still waiting for the replacement shipment . 
fits a double 
it provides cool mist . 
this unit is filterless as everything is easily removable for washing . it is recommended to wash the unit once per every 4 full tanks of use with vinegar and hot water . 
no . i notice it makes a noise when you unplug it . no shock . 
no night light . 
cool . and no . 
cool mist . 
super quiet , easy to clean . it should last at least 12 hours per filling . for medium to large size room 
i had the same problem , the red light stayed on & could n't get the green light to show until i adjusted the float knob ( the white knob ) ... then it worked perfect ! 
cool mist . it is extremely easy to fill , simply take the cap off and pour water into it . 
this unit is filterless as everything is easily removable for washing . it is recommended to wash the unit once per every 4 full tanks of use with vinegar and hot water . 
no . no night light . the only light is a small indicator light -- green for on red for needs to be filled . i bought two and am very happy with them . there is no condensation and no noise . 
yes it just come out of the spout on the top . you can adjust the amount of mist that comes out . i adjust ours down , because it puts out a lot of mist . we love ours ! ! 
about a day in full power and almost two days on the lowest setting . 
yep 
yes 
there is an on and off switch on the back of the unit ! 
i have n't found any humidifiers that are truly easy to clean ... but this one is more convenient than most . i clean it frequently and just stay on top of it ... .i am happy with this purchase . 
no filter required . i just fill with water , plug in and turn on . 
it holds about a gallon . 
this compact humidifier you can adjust from cool to warm . the cool is not cold . this is strictly a humidifier for use with water ... ... . no oils : ( . 
it holds about a gallon of water . 
unfortunately , you can not turn off the light . the night light is very dim , and when next to a bed stand , should still feel cozy and not too bright . 
unsure . it never ran long enough to find out all of functions or what they did ! can tell you when it worked it did exactly what we wanted , but after a few hours it would stop , you would have to `` clean it '' . returned for a holmes that has worked continuously without fail for weeks now . 
this is a filter less humidifier 
this is a cool mist humidifier 
unfortunately not ... .but the light is dim enough that it should not bother a person . our next version will have that option coming in nov. 2014 . 
do n't know . my jar opening is just under 4 '' , and it wo n't fit it . 
they should be a good fit for a 3.5 '' jar . these sealing rings are 3-3 8 '' in diameter and are able to stretch to that diameter if the jar has a raided ridge that they can slip over . but they are not as stretchable as silicon sealing rings . 
this item ( kilner item # 0025.501 ) has an outer diameter of 4 '' and an inner diameter of 3-3 8 '' . there are no kilner gaskets with an inner diameter of 3 '' . 
unfortunately the largest kilner seal for the 3l clip top jars measures only 3 3 8 '' inner and 4 1 8 '' outer diameter .

people have had problems with using the k-cup adapter portion of the solofil v2 . their brewers are not destroyed just clogged . i have a solution . the clogging happened to my v500 . i have found a way to fix the issue . the problem is that the needle that punches the top of the k-cup gets clogged . this happens because the vue positions the k-cup in the brewer sidways so the needle is in a position for grounds to get into it . this does n't happen with vue cups because the area where the needle punches into the vue cup has an indent of filter material that prevents grounds coming in contact with the needle . it also does not happen in the k-cup brewers because those brewers position the k-cup upright when brewing . the fix is to unfold a paper clip and rod out the needle hole . this can be done by opening the top of the brewer and inserting the end of the paper clip in the hole of the needle ( flashlight needed ) . once you have inserted it move it in and out a few times , remove , close the brewer and brew an 8oz cup with nothing in the machine . you will see loose grounds in the cup . everything should work now until it happens again ( unfortunately it will ) . 
when i was in bed bath & beyond the sale rep told me they removed them because they were not working properly . he said they were `` revising '' the design & comming out with a new one that will not damage the vue machines . he wasnt sure when it would be released . he did say that it will be restocked in the stores when it becomes available.that was about 2 weeks ago ! hope this helps : ) 
it was n't . i bought one and would never have paid this much for it . i think it is because you can not find them anymore . 
either would work . i chose the v2 for my v700 . by being able to brew k cups , i now have a wider variety of flavors i can brew . 
it works great with using your own coffee or even tea ( leaves ) it works ok with using the k-cups , sometimes they do n't brew so great but if your purpose for it is using loose coffee it 's great 
since this version of the solofill is used for the keurig vue system , regular k-cups will not fit . the adapter is used to facilitate the use of k-cups in the vue system . i find that if you seat the k-cup on the adapter first before placing it in the container , it works as indicated . a lot of people do not do this and the point does not pierce the bottom of the k-cup allowing it to drain the coffee through it as it is supposed to . then the coffee backs up through the top creating a big mess . i myself roast my own coffee and utilize the filter enclosed with it and it works great . vue cups are hard to find locally and if you do find them , they are usually not what you really want . 
hi , the lid is not used when using `` k `` cups . carefully remove the lid buy opening the lid to about 180 , then push the lid down at the hinge . the lid gets easier to open after being removed a few times . good luck . : - ) 
yes it works on all keurig vue brewing machines . i was excited to finally find a refill cup for the vue ( v600 ) 
you are doing something wrong , our v2 works great in our v500 , and we have not had any problems at all with it . 
the v2 includes an adapter that allows you to use k-cup portion packs by just pushing them into the solofill and using it in the vue . first remove the the solofill cover and filter and then place the k-cup adapter in the solofill , then push the k-cup on to a sharp point that punctures the bottom of the k-cup . then `` brew . '' the v1 did not have the adapter . 
no spices , just jars and the carousel . 
the covers for these spice jars can indeed be twisted to help provide a pretty good seal . at least in my experience . 
no 
no spices , just lidded jars and the carousel . 
no 
it is very lightweight . without a comforter inside it weighs the same as a basic sheet . 
have n't had a problem with either . however , i 've not washed it yet so i ca n't say it wo n't wrinkle . i believe it stated on the package that you are not to iron it . 
i think it makes it warmer-i sure love the quality , color , fit and feel ! ! ! ! 
i bought a duvet cover and two pillow shams . 
the package says china . 
it is very soft , definitely not scratchy . i bought purple and it is so rich looking . 
i have only had my duvet for a few months and i have n't had any problems with the feathers comin thru . the only closure the duvet has though , are buttons . guess it depends how bad yours shed . 
it 's pretty small . i just recycled the box yesterday . an educated guess would be 12x14 
it is an oversized set . our mattress is a `` california '' queen and it fits perfectly with about 4 inches overlay on each side and on the end when pulled into the pillows . ca n't beat it for the money ! ! 
it looks more blue and it 's made in the usa 
i find that is the case . they were larger than i expected ( in a good way ) and very sturdy . would order more if i had more space . 
yes , we scoop sugar out of one and i am a 6 foot guy so my hands are not tiny . it is 5.5 inches at the widest point and tapers to 4 inches on each end . plus you can pour from when half full and lighter . 
these are 10.5 inches tall . they are large . i love them . very good quality 
not sure ... they are large ! they do hold almost the whole large bag of generic cereal ... i think they would but my hubby said he does n't think so . 
it easily holds your normal 5 lb bag 
i have never used the rubbermaid modular , but i use these for cereal and the top does stay open 90 % of the time because of a little tab . 
i have only stored cereal in them , but the seal seems very tight . 
yes very comfortable . sleeping is not super comfy but you do n't want guests to stay that long anyway 
the supports are folded down inside bottom of settee . you unzip on either end the open and pull down . the bed is very comfortable , firm and solid feel . you do not feel the bars at all 
yes , the pillow is included . chair works well . 
it took a bit of figuring out between the sparse diagram provided and some trial and error . 2 of the leg are packed inside the unit behind a zipper . undo those first and extend the legs . you should be able to figure it out from there . hope this helps . 
approx . 18 '' . 
if you are fond of a very firm sleeping surface , it would be ok ... .it is well made , but i do not find it at all comfortable , sad to say . 
i do not know . for the temporary period that i have it , it looks working well . 
yes use the screws and allen wrench it 's easy 
pull the leg toward you , it releases the spring and then you can fold it . 
seat gt about 16 '' off the ground . bed hgt when extended about 10 '' off the ground 
hello - thank you for your interest in designer living . please see care instructions below : machine wash cold , gentle cycle , and separately . do not bleach . tumble dry low , remove promptly . do not iron . if there is no free movement in the washer or dryer , use large capacity commercial washer dryer . thank you , krystal designer living customer service rep 1-888-879-8790 
i do n't know the weight but would call it a light weight quilt . i love the weight because it 's not too heavy 
i just got a set that is white with a brown pattern from a local retailer 
i think it depends on the type of pet . however , we have two large dogs and it seems to brush off easily . 
well it keeps out cats , and i suppose it would keep out mice as well . the color is more of a deep salmon than a true red 
yes , i 's what in england they would call pillar box red . true red . nothing salmon about the one i have . 
works fine ... we do n't use it for freshness , just to keep the counter from getting cluttered . all in all your bamboo may be better . 
16 '' x 9 1 2 '' wide and 7 '' high . it is a nice big size . 
hello elaine , this item does come in black ( model # bb40201 ) , the red of course ( model # bb40202 ) , and stainless steel chrome ( model # bb00085 ) . i hope this was helpful for you . 
black edges are rubber . 
the vacuum is self adjusting . it easily handles going from a smooth surface to carpet . in my house there is up to 1 2 inch difference . the only thing you need to do is push the brush button once on carpet . 
yes the post-motor filter ( the black one ) is washable , the pre-motor filter ( its white and pleated ) is somewhat washable but the pleats might wear a bit . might be best just to wipe it down with a damp cloth vs. submerging it in water . make sure when you wash the filters to let them dry at least 24 hours before using the vacuum again , you will want them to be completely dry or sometimes you get a musty smell . 
afraid not . it handles like a much lighter vacuum than it really is , but am afraid that it does not move on its own . 
it does automatically . we have a wheel that squeaked like crazy until i put some wd40 on it . i do n't like it on tile floors as it tends to blow things around . this is better than what i had before . i have 4 long haired animals and it does a decent job . nothing is perfect . 
yes , but you will have to empty the bag less cup as its fill line tends to reach quickly . very simple to do . i hope this helps . 
it 's not self-propelled , so it can be a workout . you might want to look elsewhere . 
if i 'm not mistaken it 's on the bottom of the canister . you have to release the canister and it should show the serial # and product # there . i only found it because i had to call customer service for assistance . 
you sure can lloyd ! as the other responders mentioned this works great for cleaning cars and was one of the main reasons we designed this vacuum ! 
this machine comes with a 5 year limited warranty . 
yes . you can detach the canister and vacuum between the slats with the included attachments and use the regular vacuum with the brush off to get the wood slats . 
yes ! i use this exclusively to make cold brew coffee . it 's a longer process , but you put about 1 3 cup grinds in with a full beaker of cold or room temperature filtered water . put the lid on , but do n't press down the plunger . let the coffee steep overnight at room temperature ( or for a full 24 hours in the fridge ) . in the morning , press the plunger down and you 'll have a coffee concentrate to keep in your fridge . it 's great over ice because it does n't water down like hot coffee . 
thank you for this question . here at sterlingpro we are continually testing our product and in the last two years the double screen has lasted . the key to maintaining the filter is to clean it at once . if you wait for several hours or overnight it will be more difficult to clean and will require you to scrub them more causing more wear and tear . please note that the beaker though should not be cleaned until it cools sufficiently . if these simple steps are followed your sterlingpro french press should last up to ten years . 
the plunger stem unthreads at the base where the screens are held in place and also at the ball tip . be extra careful when twisting the pieces to unthread as there is a small bolt securing the screen attachements . i also recommend working over a tray , so as not to loose or misplace any of the small pieces . the white insulated layer is also removable from the stainless steel dome cap . keep track of all the pieces when disassembling to ensure you have everthing to reassemble once all the pieces have been thoroughly cleaned . 
just the top of the lid . the contact would be minimal . 
i removed the logo easily with nail polish remover . 
i just recently purchased mine and have n't thought about what would i do if the filter or plunger need to be replaced . unfortunately i threw away the box and have no idea how a person may accomplish that : ( may need to replace the entire press ( perhaps used ? ) 
made in china is on the bottom of the box 
oh dear , the answer by adrienne douke is completely wrong . espresso is a method of brewing very concentrated coffee by using a high pressure to force a small amount of water through finely ground coffee . a french press can not make true espresso . you can improvise and use finely ground coffee and a little bit of water and steep together in the french press , but it will not be the same . espresso is not a type of roast , unless your talking about the trademarked 'roast ' that companies like starbucks sell . this creates an unfortunate misconception that 'espresso ' is a type of roast . starbucks has chosen a particular blend of beans that when pulled as espresso shots , gives the flavor of a dark caramelized roast , hence 'espresso roast ' . starbucks has deemed that this is the best flavor profile for their espresso drinks . however , this is not a universal expression of espresso . actually , many flavor profiles can be created by the espresso method and they tend to taste so much better than the starbucks 'espresso ' roast . in conclusion , a french press is a method of brewing coffee , just like drip , pour-over , and espresso . and just like how each brewing method changes the dynamics of the brewed coffee drastically , the french press takes on its own profile . it 's one of the simplest and best methods for brewing regular coffee . the key is to use coarsely ground ( using a burr or conicial grinder ) quality beans ( not folgers or the like ) , and the proper ratio of grounds to water . if its too dark , just dilute with more water after the brew process . 
the sterlingpro replacement glass beaker is supplied on amazon now . the current price is $ 15.85 . if you search `` sterlingpro coffee press '' , you will find the replacement beaker . 
i gave this french press as a gift to a friend for christmas.this is the third one she got to use and compare with the other two she respond -no doubt this is the best french press she own- amazon warning was to check the glass jar immediately . but the jar was intact . 
i put mine in the dishwasher and have had no problems . 
it only comes with a devil egg holder for one tier . it is in 2 pieces and i think each piece holds 12 pieces . not sure but maybe you can buy additional deviled egg trays ... . 
24 eggs 
yes 
just sits on top but it 's a pretty snug fit . it wo n't eadily move or anything 
they will not fit i can barley fit a small lipstick , much smaller than expected 
it does come in two pieces but they considered it a set so the price is for both together . hope this helps ! 
yes you can fit the naked palettes in the bottom draw but it will be a tight fit . yes the top draws slides perfectly fine 
are you familiar with the urban decay naked palette or the too faced chocolate eye shadow palette ? well i can fit one palette in each of those lower drawers and that 's about it . i needed 2 of these side by side and am able to fit what i use . 
yes 
yes . i just tested my doterra and edens garden oils and they fit . 
i do apologize , but we do not have any information on the muji drawers . but if you look on the description of our product you can see the size of the drawers . best regards , nile corp 
i tried a color club nail polish and it did n't fit . hope that helps 
hi kenneth , the $ 189 is the price for two stools . they are sold in pairs because of the shipping . 
the seat height is 28 '' . 
same height 
hi toni , the seat is 28 '' high . hope this helps . woodward 's cottage terry 
hi cristy , that 's a good question . to the best of my knowledge they have never been rated for weight load . i do know that they are used in commercial establishments and have not heard of any complaints . bamboo is one of the hardest woods used for chairs . if i can be of more help please let me know . woodward 's cottage terry 
no zippers on these pillows . 
yes , mine was . it was also in a huge box with packing peanuts- we laughed about all the protective packaging for a pillow . 
no i have not had that problem i have 7 of them 
the care label says `` spot clean only '' , so if there are major spills or messes , it would be a problem . however , i 'm very pleased with mine - they look nice and are comfortable . i do have animals and have to remove hair from them , but otherwise they are fine . 
no , not machine washable or dry able . spot clean only . 
much too small for you ... 
that 's a hard question to answer . how large is large ? by the way , i use this cushion in an upholstered chair with arms ( not in a bed ) . i would say that the arms on the cushion do drastically inhibit the seating space on the chair . however , the cushion is very soft and molds to the chair and body . i personally love it - i would love it even more if it did n't have those arms ! ! i do n't consider myself petite , but i do n't consider myself large either - i 'm 5'6 '' tall and weigh 130 lbs . 
i have fallen asleep while using this , but not for long . it keeps you sitting up pretty much . 
i found this bed rest to be too soft . i wanted to use it to sit up in bed to read . it did not provide the support i was looking for - not very firm . personally , i found sitting in a recliner or sofa worked best for me when feeding my baby . 
i am an adult , and i use it every day . it just needs to lean against a wall , bed headboard , etc . 
the cover is 100 % cotton . the fill is 100 % polyester . 
i am only a 5'2 '' older woman , so i could n't attest to one with your measurements ; however , i would not guess that it would be that supportive for you . i have to have it up against my headboard in order to be completely supportive the way i want . that 's the best i can do . 
it needs a headboard or wall to stay upright . 
no it 's not removeable , but the whole thing is washable .

my door has two hinges ( near the top of the door jamb and near the bottom ) and it works fine on the larger cabidor . the attachment pieces can be adjusted to any location that will position them to the area of your door hinges . the instructions that come with this product are concise easy to follow . if you want the less expensive half-size cabidor , you 'd most likely need an additional hinge in the middle of your door jamb . the reason being , the shorter cabidor also needs to attach to two hinges but is not tall enough to reach both the top and bottom of a two-hinge door . before you buy your cabidor , make sure you have at least 3 1 2 inches from the middle of the barrel of your hinges to the wall behind the door . this is important . you 're going to love this product . 
not really sure . possibly a thin fiberboard , but it 's covered with a hard formica-type finish , so it 's hard to tell . i must say though it 's very sturdy and not heavy ... maybe 25-30 pounds ; real wood of that sturdiness would be heavier . when i ordered it , i thought it may be a bit rinkey-dink , but upon opening the box , was surprised at the quality . i love this thing . tons of out-of-the way storage . if you 're going to buy one , make sure you have at least 3.5 inch space between the center of your door 's hinge pin barrel and the wall . 
the cabinet rests on the hinges and there is no way to change it . it is made to be used as described and would not suit your purpose . i would not recommend purchasing it with intentions of returning it if it did n't work out . the special packaging would be a big challenge and not worth the effort . 
no , brooms would not fit . the middle shelf is not moveable but the others are 
the way it is designed you would not be able to mount it on the wall without customisation 
the cabinet is made of mdf ( medium density fiberboard ) , which is a wood composite material that is very strong . it is much stronger than particle board , which can be flimsy . i own multiple units , and they are very sturdy . 
you can fully open the door without any problems ! 
as it 's designed , no . 
what is the notice ? 
i 'm guessing someone made a mistake ... because you 're right , it 's plastic . why do n't you pose this question to someone in customer servcie from amazon . it 's been my experience that they will try and make things right . their customer service is usually excellent and works hard to resolve issues . and i believe you send it back if you 're unhappy with it . 
yes 
hi , i ca n't answer that question , but when i received two of these , the `` beak '' or tube from the dispenser was rolling around in the box and i was convinced it was broken . it seems to attach with just a friction fit , so firmly pushing it in the hole on the push button holds it well for me . i guess glue would be a definite solution . if , though , yours is lost or missing , this wo n't help ! ! william 
the bottom is almost 3 '' across and the thickest part in the middle is 3.75 '' across . 
it 's plastic . 
i just measured it from base to top it 's 7 inches high 
hello mary you will still need to put out a vent in the window . thanks 
i have n't measured it but it is about 6 ft when stretched out . you need to keep it as short as possible since it gets hot and will radiate heat that offsets the cooling effect . i 'm actually looking for an insulation wrap for it . mine will only cool a small room . i actually got it to use in a tent . 
no , not yet . 
yes , work well for that size . 
i do not have the unit here but i believe it is a 4 inch -- it is flex pipe made of pvc -- unit works well and there have been no water drainage issues 
the unit itself does not . the exhaust tube that comes off the back does however . it needs somewhere for the heat and moisture it pulls from the air to go . 
yes , it comes with all the accessories for the window vent . it also comes with an extended window piece in case you have newer windows that slide across instead of the traditional up and down . i had it in a 1 br , so i thought it was pretty loud . all these portable ac units are pretty loud though , but since it 's 8,000 btu 's its quieter than a larger unit for sure . 
yes 
sounds like the compressor is shutting on and off in relation to the the unit 's set temperature and the room temperature . this is normal for the air conditioner 's compressor to shut on and off . it is a feature of the air conditioner that will help conserve energy . 
yes it does require a window to be vented . 
yes , according to this link http : www.appliancepartspros.com search.aspx ? model=rvm1325bw003 your magnetron pn is wb27x10017 . double check your model # though , i think you put an extra 0 in before the 3 at the end . a company that makes a major line of microwave replacement parts cross refrence this pn to 10qbp0229 but you can also use 10qbp0230 without an issue with the inc. stud kit ( 4 screws really ) see http : www.genuineapplianceparts.com item 10qbp0230_erp_microwave_oven_magnetron 756 . magnetron cross reference http : www.mainelectronics.com pdf micropart.pdf currently on amazon the 0230 is the cheaper of the two @ $ 38.37 to your door - http : www.amazon.com gp product b0050kjd4o ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 you can see my review there also . your oe pn for the hv diode should be wb27x1160 . if yours is actually bad and you need one with a little searching you should not have to pay more than $ 10 for one , maybe as little as $ 5 or $ 6 to your door , cross ref . to 11qbp0237 or 11qbp0236 , the only difference is the piece of shrink tube insulation . here is one for $ 3.75 not inc. shipping http : www.appliancezone.com showproduct.aspx ? id=26900 and on amazon currently @ $ 5.46 to your door for the `` generic '' part http : www.amazon.com gp product b004we8rle ref=olp_product_details ? ie=utf8 & me= & seller= or with shrink tubed installed for another $ 4 http : www.amazon.com gp product b0050kjdy4 sr=8-1 qid=1384755580 ref=olp_product_details ? ie=utf8 & me= & qid=1384755580 & seller= & sr=8-1 if you already have shrink tube avail . save yourself a few $ . good luck . 
yes it worked for me . i know this kit applies to various applications . my over range microwave is a frigidaire and this kit fixed the no heating problem . just look at the position of the connector in your spacemsker and make sure your old magnetron is marked w label that reads om75p ( 10 ) 
yes 
so they can return this kit if it turns out to only be a bad diod ? 
youll need to call ge and they will tell you which part number get and fit right . 
no . the mags are different and not compatible with a 2m167b . 
there 's no cross reference showing this mag would be compatible , but it is possible it would work as long as the terminals , body and fins line up the same . 
no 
if the microwave now 'runs ' but makes a different sound when you try to use it , the problem is most likely the magnetron . on my ge model , the magnetron burns out about 2-3 times a year . it 's really frustrating , but the cost of a new model like what i have makes it reasonable to just keep replacing the magnetron . i do n't recommend doing this yourself unless the unit is out of warranty and you do not have any kind of service plan . 
yes it will work . according to the ge parts web site your model jeb1095bb002 uses a magnetron part # wb27x10089 . the magnetron part wb27x10017 ( referenced above ) is a replacement for wb27x10089 . i suggest you follow the recommendation to replace the magnetron and the high voltage diode that come with it . 
i have the floor fan which does tilt . i am sorry i do not know about the tabletop model . 
no , but it is quiet , lightweight and very easy to assemble . 
yes , but incredibly simple . 
it requires some work . you need to take front cage off then place fan blade over the post then there is a cap that goes on but it is counter threaded so spin it op of a normal screw . if this does n't work please email more 
the size of the mass is 75x75x16mm with 16mm being the stack thickness . that 's not good at all for a 16-inch fan . in fact , that 's not even good for a 9-inch fan . the blades are made of thin pp plastic which are very lightweight and flexible making the motor work less hard . 
hi pat , thank you for your inquiry . the pelonis 16 '' stand fan stands 48 inches tall as measured from the floor to the top the fan when fully extended . the base measures 27 inches by 27 inches . please feel free to contact us with any further questions . best regards , the mobile essentials support team 
i 've been using this fan for several months now , and i have it locked in place to blow directly in one area . the fan is used almost daily , and it has never shifted from the spot it 's locked to . i 've been very pleased with it . 
the fan cage is metal . that 's part of the reason i selected this one - the plastic ones are bulkier and block part of the air flow . it can be unscrewed to open it for a thorough cleaning . 
there are quite a few recipes on pinterest . i 've had a hard time finding them other places . i 'm rather surprised that the manufacturer did n't put out a book . good luck ! 
it 's similar to a thick spaghetti noodle . 
i have not personally , but i would think you could . i spiralized brocolli stocks , which did n't turn out great , but it still worked . i would also make sure i wore gloves as it could be really messy with beets ! 
3 blades . there are compartments on the side of it that holds them . its worth purchasing ! i love mine . 
in the top rack ... it should be fine . i had no problems washing mine there . i really love my spirooli . i just have to remember to reduce the size of my vegetables being spiroolied ! 
i believe this is the same item based on what i 've read on the following website . http : www.ultimate-weight-products.com h-wc-spiral.html 
it 's for the short way . potatoes do n't work well with this one from my experience . it works great for the softer veggies like squash and onions 
100 % polyester . bottom right of package says 100 % polyester . label says `` soft touch of '' ... cotton and amazon site says `` soft as '' ... cotton . there is no cotton in the bed sheet . imported from china 100 % polyester . 
yes , i have a deep mattress as well and they stay put - they are very quality sheets ! i definitely recommend them . we love them and plan on buying more ! 
yes the sheet fits nicely . 
i agree the sheets are as displayed in packaging 
2 but they are all polyester not cotton . this was disappointing as it said cotton on front but labels said made in china polyester 
this is my first purchase of egyptian cotton sheets and i feel they are smoother to touch and i think they 're adjustable to the weather , keep you warm when it 's cold and cooler in the hotter months . 
no . they are standard sized , and being such will not fit a king sized pillow 
i ordered sheets in black and they look nothing like that . mine are very thin and dull looking . the ones in the picture look thicker and shinny . 
they are made of 109 % egyptian cotton . i have never had such soft , beautiful colors sheets ! you ca n't believe how soft they are even when you feel them . i will try to buy only these brand sheets from now on . 
i do n't really know . what i can tell you is that they are very soft . softer than the regular ones that i have bought in macys or jcpenny . 
well , not really . i turned one of my stickles bottles right side up . because the holes are designed for the bottle to be upside down , the hole narrows part way down to the diameter of the cap and the right-side-up bottle only fits into the hole about 1 4 inch . so , while upright bottles could be displayed neatly and securely , they stick up too far for the lid on the satchel to close . i recommend the scrapcessories bottle caddy for what you need . they also make a caddy case that the bottle caddy fits into . it 's not as big as the artbin stachel , but i have several and they stack nicely . if you need to transport them , they make a strap that holds 3 caddy cases together and has a handle . 
it is made to hold bottles of glitter glue ie , stickles , stampin up , ranger distress stickles . if your paint bottles are the same size it will probably work . 
it is made to hold bottles of glitter glue ie , stickles , stampin up , ranger distress . 
yes ... ebags slim lunchboxs work great.. ( you can get them on amazon : ) you have room for the lunchblox and a thermos ... : ) hope that helps ! 
yes , but nothing else ( like a juice box or water bottle ) will . the dimensions are 9x7x3 . 
the dishes all snap onto the included ice pack and it is : 8.5 in . x 7.5 in . with the dishes attached , it is about 3 inches tall . hope this helps . : ) 
not leakproof . love these containers , though ! they are awesome ! i put liquids yogurt soft stuff in the individual containers . 
i think as long as it stays upright and does n't get tilted it wo n't leak . 
no , not any of the ones we have . 
no 
they are leak proof . a preschooler might have a little difficulty opening ... 
i 'm not familiar with the wildkin bag , but here are the dimensions of the boxes : large container ( 5.5x 5x 2.25 in ) and the 2 smaller containers ( 5x3x2.25 in ) 
we have used it for 6 months and have never had any odors or different taste to our food 
the overall outside dimensions of the bottom container are 5 1 2 '' x 4 3 4 '' x2 1 2 '' ( with the lid on ) . the inside dimensions of the bottom container are 4 3 4 '' x4 '' x2 '' . 
we use a `` retro style '' pottery barn lunch box and these boxes and ice block fit perfectly into it . as an addition to the rubbermaid boxes and our favorite lunch pail , i also swear by the eco vessel brand drink thermoses . they have a flip top that my daughter can easily open and close by herself ! it took me a few purchases and some frustration before i found this perfect trio for my full-day kindergartener to have a successful lunch . i hope this response helps with your purchase decision . 
yes 
it might but there would n't be anyroom ... . 
only 3 , 
yes 
it is it 's own separate piece , you could put it on the bottom if you would like to . we use it in a small child 's lunchbox and it keeps the whole thing cold no matter the placement . hope that helps . 
i think so . they have a small extended lip to grab onto . i find connecting them into the blok more difficult but they all come apart easily . 
yes they can . the containers have 'imprints ' so that they fit together whether you use the ice pack or not . 
no , rubbermaid packs as a set 
yes . click the link above and scroll down to the bpa section of the article . 
just under 1 tablespoon . each one holds 14ml 
http : justbento.com handbook bento-basics what-are-japanese-plastic-bento-boxes-made-of has a helpful article on japan 's food quality plastics . 
i do . my set snaps closed very tight . 
i could have my friend in japan read the packaging for me , but i 'd guess that depends on how hot your cycles go and if you could get the little lids to prop open right in your utensil basket . it says they withstand temperatures from -4f to 158f ( -20c to 70c ) . i did n't worry about it since i just washed them out when i got home . 
i 've used this in my daughter 's lunch box with ranch dressing and have n't had them leak . 
my 1 1 2 year old can get the smaller ones open after some hard work the bottle one is a little harder but for a 4-5 year old it 's the perfect size and they should be able to open it . it 's really secure i have n't had any leaks and the tops are a flexible hard plastic . 
no 
the green and orange containers , in the boy colors , are rectangle . the green looks square in the picture , but they are n't . 
i have not used it in the microwave but i would think as it is a heavy plastic it would hold up fine . it will hold the entire lunch . no more ziploc bags in my house 
i do n't know how big is the pottery barn kids mckenzie retro lunch bag , but it perfect fits the stephen joseph lunch pals tiger lunch box . and i got the product details from amazon : department : unisex-adultmanufacturer : stephen joseph kitchenmanufacturer reference : sj-1016-85product dimensions:7 inches x 5.2 inches x 9.5 inches ; 6.4 ouncesshipping weight:1 poundsasin : b0084ejspmamazon.com sales rank:103310 hope this helps . 
it can fit in a small lunch kit 
no it 's only the blanket but it 's very soft and really nice my daughter loves it 
no corny disney anything on it . i bought it because it matched my daughter 's room 's theme . i 've never even heard of the movie , but am glad it did n't have any identifying text or faces from it . if you like what you see in the pic , that 's pretty much what you get . it 's decent quality all in all . very soft . 
no it does n't . and it 's not a comforter , it 's just a blanket 
no it does not its a nice warm fleece blanket 
i really think they do n't get much hotter than my other dishes . they are heavy and so beautiful and we enjoy them , i maybe crazy but i think the food tastes better , their beautiful . we want to purchase another set . enjoy them ! ! ! ! 
you will get 4 of each item 
china 
the ones i have are black . 
we own the latte cups , same material , same manufacturer as these dishes . they will be microwave safe because it is not real gold . real gold trim will spark in microwave . these are safe . 
hi , jude , there were 2 sets of cereal bowls on ebay . i bought one . there is a set from 222 fifth called eliza that would mix well with this . amazon should have it . macy 's had a set of the eliza mixed with peacock salad plates and eliza cereal bowls . good luck to you . rochelle 
yes , they are beautiful they match every blue dish l have because of the multi blues on the peacock . 
11 inches in diameter 
they went throughout the dish washer without a hitch . enjoy all the compliments ! my only regret is that i did n't buy more . vibrant colors . 
they are serrated . 
plastic 
we are having the same issue in the same time frame . 
any of the 'international ' are not made in germany . these are made in china . 
germany 
wood 
is n't the santoku knife the one that 's standing up outside the block ib the picture ? if that 's the one you 're looking for- yes it does come with the set . enjoy . i was pleased with my set . 
stainless steel colored , it was very nice . : ) 
serrated 
6 steak , cutting knives ( very sharp ) , bread knife , carving knife , large all purpose knife , culinary knife for veggies and quick chopping , pair of scissors . very nice set , fully satisfied . 
no , and no again , i cook a lot of chinese food , and when i try to slice chicken , the meat sticks to the blade with each slice and you have to stop and pull it off . wish i had not wasted my money . works on some vegetables . would i recommend it to any one . no i would not . 
the knife is 10.5 '' long with a 6 '' blade and 4.5 '' handle . it does not come in a holder except for a plastic cap to protect the tip in the packaging which you can keep . there are currently no color choices . 
it is real sharp , but i have problems with the spaces in the center . i use it more for cheese , but not for other things . 
answer ? what is the question ? which knife is better ? i have no idea , at least about a randall or a topps , never heard of either of those . i know for sure that the aero knife , at least the one i got , is just about useless . 
no you ca n't i 'm afraid . i 've used my knife for almost every kitchen chore . and so far , it 's shown no sign of dulling.i give the knife 5 stars for holding an edge 
18 to 20 
its like a metal basket- it 's really cute 
it is black as shown . 
do n't think so looks like brushed metal of some sort 
it is one solid unit . the electrical cord plugs into the side of the unit . you have to plug and unplug the cord with every use ( if you want to rinse after every use ) . it 's a decent quality frother . 
i just went in and measured . at the maximum fill line , it holds just about 1 1 4 cups . 
yes it does . 
yes it is . 
i am not really sure what you mean by that , andrew . i can tell you it works really well . we love pouring the milk in , turning it on , and by the time our coffee or tea is hot , the milk is ready to go . nice and hot , and if you like it frothy , this product is for you . 
no . warm but not hot . 
yes , approximately two cups . 
very easy to clean . rinse and dry by hand . very simple and fast . 
i did n't have studs to screw into so i just used anchors and 4 .750 '' wood screws . it is full of bottles and is still very sturdy . 
yes . just be careful not to screw too tightly into wall to avoid cracking . i also used a bit of double sided tape towards the inside bottom so it does n't stick out i could n't tell if it was my wall but an easy fix 
they are molded to the backing and at each end . the first one i ordered came in perfect condition - very heavy-duty . the second and third ones arrived cracked and broken . but still a good solid product . 
it has four screw holes . very easy to put up . 
the one that i received did n't have any markings or names on it at all . 
yes 
yes 
hi , you could , but it would need to lean on something.. the base is n't super sturdy and it might get too heavy with tons of polish on it . 
2 inch and it can hold opi by nicole ones ! i buy it for my dougther and she is so happy with this ! 
compared to other vacuums i 've owned , the dyson works well on stairs . the base is small enough to sit on a step , while the flexible hose and scaled-down attachments are easy to maneuver over individual steps and into corners . i have n't had a single problem with this vac . 
measured out to 24 feet . 
it works well for us . we got it because my husband is recovering from a stem cell transplant and must be in a dust free environment . 
i 've owned 5-10 vacuums over the years . this is by far the noisiest . when i vacuum my half bath and want to vacuum behind the door ( which entails closing the door ) , i brace myself for the deafening sound , then quickly finish to get the door back open . i also make sure i turn the vacuum on after i unclick it from upright position ( and opposite when turning it off ) - the decibel level coming out of the top of the tube seems borderline dangerous to me . 
never , they are permanent filters . there are two filters and i recommend washing them once a month . one filter is located in the ball assembly . the other filter is located where the handle to the dirt container is . 
the only change to this vacuum is the name , the msrp ( now $ 399 , was $ 499 ) , and possibly the color of the canister . the specs are exactly the same . this is not a redesign , only a name change . 
nancy , it does , but it is very small ! also , a detail hose attachment is included ! i would check , amazon to see if dyson has additional attachment ! one other , thing , nancy , the dc40 is the original size vacuum ! it is small , does a fantastic job ! if you have animals , you will need to buy the dc65 animal ! it is bigger , but it is heavier ! my dc40 is light , moves very fast , so easy to use ! the larger dc65 , does cost more too ! hope this helps you , nancy ! like i said at first , the attachment is small , about 3 to 4 inches across , with red , fibric pads on either side ! 
it weights 14.6 pounds . the average vacuum weighs 18-22 pounds 
it does very well with small rugs -- does not eat them -- dr 
so far , so good . i have long hair , too , and the dyson just sucks it up along with everything else . i 'm really happy with it . 
we do often do sweet potatoes , but have done them a few times and yes it does work well . i love mine so much i bought one for my brother . i 'm sure you will enjoy yours . 
yes no problem . 
a good sized baked potato - 5 to 6 inches long with a good size girth . but the bigger the potato the more effort you need to push it threw . it is a good machine . 
this is going to be everything you need . if you think you might be doing a lot of fries , you might consider mounting this to the wall . if you mount to the wall , it will give you better leverage , you will be able to do fries faster and you can put a bucket underneath to cath the fries as you cut them . the push block will help get the end of the potato through the `` knives '' . if you did n't have the block , you would end up with potato partially cut . i think you will love this thing , i know i do . i might also add , if you put a pinch of vinegar in the bucket with the cut fries and water . you will end up with better fries , the vinegar draws out the starch from the potatoes ( so e people will use pickles in place of the vinegar ... you might play around with it ) . good luck and please feel free to email me if you have any questions . billy 
yes , you need a push block to match each size cutter blade you order . 
absolutely ; you have to make sure you buy both the blade , and the grid for that size . popping the blade and grid off is a breeze , and should be done after each use for cleaning anyways . 
yes . you can interchange the cutter . take off the front wing nuts ( and washers ) and the cutter will come right off . 
i would go with the 3 8 or 1 4. the 1 2 inch is a little big . 
i assume you mean waffle fries , no , this is a french fry cutter , you need a mandolin for that 
no . only one disc . 
yes , this item will shut off automatically when the water runs out . so it could be used in night and you do n't need to worry about it . 
no 
its 5 1 2 in high and 3 wide at the bottom ... good unit but do really make any difference when its on at night . my friend told me he wakes up feeling good when its on but not for me . my bedroom may be too big for it . give it a try if you want . 
this is a small personal device . you will notice effects if you are close by , but the humidifier will not be effective in a large room with high ceilings . the essential oils will diffuse throughout the room , though . 
any oil works fine . 
it depends on the quality and concentration of the oil . it also depends on your own taste ; if you like a smooth or strong aroma . in average i use about 20 drops per full charge ( 500ml ) of top quality essential oil . i hope you 'll find this useful 
no 
the mist is immediate . 
no 
it 's about 8 hours . : ) 
i can not find the box at the moment , but i think it 's china . 
no 
yes 
sort of . they recommend using pans on low to medium heat . if you use them on high heat it will get hotter and be harder to clean the pans . 
dutch oven is the one in front right there are 8 and 10 inch fry pans in the set ( not apparent in the picture ) . the steamer basket is right behind the utensils and expands when placed in pan . the utensils are as shown and not stainless as described in the product description . 
yes it is 18 10 . 
yes , everything is stainless steel except the spoon and spatula . 
you get what you see in the picture . 
its pretty good 
its made in china . 
i did not keep this unit , it was way to small . i do n't be , i 've the bulbs are replaceable . 
yes it does have auto shut off . i love this and use it daily . i put my doterra oil mixed with water and it smells wonderful in my home . 
thanks for your question , this humidifier is not battery operated . the product description states `` power : input output ac100-240v 50~60hz dc24v 650ma '' i hope this helps ! 
the light can be turned off or on bright or darker versions of red , green , blue or white . super easy to clean and runs for 180 min before automatically shutting off . 
the japanese version used 110v , the same as us , so you do not need a transformer .

i love these sheets ! ! ! obviously they are n't silk , but they are super soft and very much have a silkiness about them . i definitely recommend these sheets . i got two sets and i could n't be more thrilled . 
yes 
well they fit fine over a ddbl bed with pad if anything i guess they wood fit a extera high profile matt 
no.. it shows prime but only in certain sizes . as for these sheets , the full size is prime eligible . 
not sure , but the seller would know 
yes it is polyester . however , they are still extremely soft and comfortable . i was shocked and pleased at the same time . 
they are egyptian cotten . super soft ! 
they should be listed as polyester ... ... .. 
i 'm 67. love them . very smooth . enjoy . 
yes , they are made in china . 
read the description again . these are not cotton let alone egyptian cotton ! i bought a set , they are polyester made in china . 
it does n't have the sheen of cotton sateen , but the sheets are really soft and silky feeling . 
no it does not . 
china 
sometimes but not always . if it tips the lid fills and does n't drain back down in the bottom so when you take the lid off you get water on you which is a real mess . 
no 
nope , not at all . 
yes , it is bpa free . it says it at the bottom of the bottle . 
not unless it was a very skinny straw . there are 4 parts , the bottle itself , the main cap , the section that goes inside the bottle for fruit , etc. , which is perforated to allow the water to pass through for the infusion process , and the 'lid ' for that section , which has small , oval holes which sieve the infused water through . the 'lip ' you drink from is thin enough to where there is no 'dribbling ' when you drink . great contraption , i really like mine . 
no it does not .

the inside is a dark brown , but be aware that the lid does n't fit well at all . i was very disappointed in it . 
no 
it 's about 6 1 2 inches tall without the lid . but my lid does n't fit on the cup 
it is . 
unfortunatly china , but we bought two and they have withstood the dishwasher and use well . 
no it does not . 
china 
sometimes but not always . if it tips the lid fills and does n't drain back down in the bottom so when you take the lid off you get water on you which is a real mess . 
no 
nope , not at all . 
yes , it is bpa free . it says it at the bottom of the bottle . 
not unless it was a very skinny straw . there are 4 parts , the bottle itself , the main cap , the section that goes inside the bottle for fruit , etc. , which is perforated to allow the water to pass through for the infusion process , and the 'lid ' for that section , which has small , oval holes which sieve the infused water through . the 'lip ' you drink from is thin enough to where there is no 'dribbling ' when you drink . great contraption , i really like mine . 
yes , by remote control ( if you lose the remote control like i did , then no ) . timer is in increments , for example , 15 min. , 30 min. , etc . ca n't set for any oddball time like 3 min. , 17 min. , etc . overall , an excellent fan , as you do n't have to worry about dusty fan blades.. always blows nice cool fresh air . in fact , i 'm using it as i 'm typing this to you . 
hi . we are the only seller of this item in us . you do n't need to register . we have all your information . any question , just feel free to contact us . thank you . 
i 'm not sure , i do n't work for them . i just purchased one of them a few months back . i works really well , but only has one level setting on the fan itself , i think you can use the remote to turn it up and down , but i 've never used the it . i have it on my desk at work and i like it except for the size , it 's a little big . 
hi , thank you for your question . it uses 110v ac power . it is not usb powered . thank you . 
hi gabriela , unfortunately we do not offer shipping to mexico city at this time . 
nope ! you 'll have to cut any fruit to juice it , def a pineapple at that ! there are 3 chutes , all 3 are the same size , it does get the job get done quicker since you can alternate between the 3. btw , is there really a juicer where you could put a whole pineapple in ? ! lol ... for some reason i found that amusing : ) 
this item is only for fruits & veggies . 
no you do not have to remove the seeds ! 
it comes with two jugs . one for the juice and one for the pulp ! 
yes , you need an adapter to use in europe 
it 's not easy to answer this in definite terms like what is a lot or how wet it is , i hope my own opinion on the subject is helpful . i feel the waste is relatively dry , which to me means it is extracting as much liquid juice as it is capable from squeezing from the fruit vegetable . i find the drier waste easier to clean up . as far as how much that depends so much on what is being `` juiced '' but when i look at what 's left it seems to be about what i would expect considering the process it uses to extract the juice , in other words what is left is truly waste and not unprocessed juice , so i would call that relatively low waste . 
you have to buy a europe adapter which is easy and cheap to find it : ) 
i do n't think so , this is for extracting juice from fruits and vegetables , you might want a mini-blender or regular blender for that . 
yes , depends on what kind of deserts you want to make 
hi , love the machine , great quality , durable and looks good . use it many times a day . and yes , i can make my own coffee with this machine . i had to do some research beforehand , for only certain types of fill-able kcups work . the one i ended up buying works great : `` solofill k3 gold cup 24k plated refillable filter cup '' ( http : www.amazon.com gp product b00c3828wa ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i01 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 ) . 
this model does not suffer from digital rights management and will process both clone and actual k cups . 
no , k cup only 
yes 
approx . 14 1 4 '' high by 15 '' deep and 10 1 4 '' wide . it is about the size of most keurig machines , you need the same clearance at the top to open the brewer mechanism . works great and not having to add water manually is a big plus . 
it has a programable on and off menue . ours comes on at 6l00 a.m. every morning . also , it has a program that will allow you to set it to go off automatically after two hours . east on and off switch in the back too . 
yes , if you do n't mind refilling the water 3 to 5 times a day 
when 'on ' , all keurig coffee-makers maintain hot water in the internal reservoir ( not the whole tank ) . this commercial version is programmable , so it can be turned on and off at preset times ( your choice ) , and set to turn off automatically a set time after the last cup was brewed . we find ours to work well and seems as energy efficient as most similar alternatives . 
this is very easy to use . this is my second one , and i have about 30 people in the office who use this on a daily basis , several times a day . reliable and good , hot coffee tea . 
do n't know about that brand reusable filter but you should be able to . i used a standard reusable filter on the one i had . 
no . this stand will only fit the play 3. flexson is going to make a stand for the play 5 , so it 's probably just a matter of time until it 's available on amazon . flexson 's website says it will be in stock next week ( as of 6 21 ) and is available for pre-order now ( for uk customers ) . 
dear mike , thank you for your inquiry . we ship mostly from our warehouses in pennsylvania through most major carriers . we also only charge sales currently to orders shipping within the state of pa. please let me know if i can answer any additional questions ! regards , eric cohen world wide stereo 
thanks for your question . as we get the rest in stock they should be listed . likely over the next week and a half or so . 
no , $ 109.00 is the price of 1 stand , not 2 . 
both 
amazon 
it does 
60 x 14.2 x 60.2 inches 
i measured one for you it 's 13 '' height 13.5 wide 
no . i would n't say it fits chocolate brown or a mocha color . it 's very pretty , but it 's a darker brown with a slight cherry color 
i 'm sure there is . it does not come with one but it has plenty of room . 
the desk is 60 inches by 60 inches . the side of the desk with the drawers is 23 1 4 inches deep . the side without drawers is 19 3 4 inches deep . the desk is 29 1 2 inches tall . 
yes on the left hand side . 
one side is 23.25 '' and the other 19.75 '' wide 
hi these items are rta ( ready to assemble ) and flat packed so disassemble could be a little difficult but it can be done 
about 14 '' i suppose . not a bad width , i can swivel my chair and sit comfortably with out feeling cramped by cabinet on that side . this has been a great desk so far , as long as you take the time to use carpenter 's wood glue where all the pegs and screws go together . really solid . 
i do n't think it 's real wood or entirely real wood but it is very solid and sturdy . i have no fears that it will fall apart anytime soon . 
23.25 '' . this desk is amazing ! took a long time to put together but the end result is well worth it . 
i do n't think it 's possible to switch the drawer location -- at least not easily . all of the holes are pre-drilled for the location as is . i 'm sure a carpenter could figure out how to do it , but it 's not a versatile design . 
yes 
thanks for posting your question , according to the product description , this sorter measures 20 '' h x 30 '' w x 14.5 '' d , each bag 14 '' w. i hope this helps ! 
yes . the bags only sit on the frame . they are super easy to take off the mail frame . and are good quality material . 
each one is 14 '' x17 '' 
29.5 '' wide 17.5 '' deep 29 '' high 
there 's an instruction manual in the product . you will need a phillips screwdriver . the product is labeled with alphabetized label . 
it is inside and easy 
21 inches tall , 29 inches wide , and 17 inches deep . ( the height does not include the extra length where the handles are ) & # 128512 ; 
measures : 20 '' h x 30 '' w x 14.5 '' d , each bag 14 '' w 
do n't purchase it . mine came with missing hardware and i have been battling the co for 6 mos . i recieved a notice that they were discontinued , no refund , no response from the co ... stuck with a piece of trash 
i believe it would ... .we have it in corner over litter box and it 's great for storing cat stuff ... .and it look so nice ! ! ! we love it ! ! 
in plan view the sides adjacent to a wall are 16 1 2 '' . the short sides project 5 1 2 '' perpendicular to the wall and the front or door side is 15 '' . these dimensions are the out to out dimensions of the trim on the top surface of the cabinet . the inside dimensions are about 2 '' smaller . 
it would have to be a really good paint . it 's finish is very solid and polished . i 'm afraid the paint might not stick to it very nicely . but i 'm also not a painter . i assume some really good paint and about 2 coats should be okay . i would personally take the risk . hope this helps you . 
24 '' painted white 
yes 
unfortunately the holes are pre drilled and can not be changed . 
mostly wood and some laminate . it 's painted so i ca n't see everywhere that laminate is atop pressboard , but i assembled it , from lots of pieces , most of which were wood . 
you could - but i think you would find the wall cabinet would be rather low . floor cabinet stands 32 '' h - it is meant to hang on the wall at a proper height ! 
back corner to either extremity 
hi richard , i just measured mine . the full perimeter all the way around is 54.5 inches . the sides that are against the wall are 15 inches each . the short angled sides near the front are 5 inches each . and the front side with the door is 14.5 inches . when i measure straight out from the wall corner to the front of the cabinet , it is 14 inches . we really like ours . 
it is mdf construction 
the doors come from the factory with pre-drilled holes to match the hinges and where they attach to the sides . i suppose you could drill your own sets of holes if you wanted to open them the other way . 
yes you can adjust the shelves go make it different heights 
thank you for your question . the dimensions are 15 x 15 x 63 inches . thanks for looking ! home wishes 
this does require assembly 
it is about 5'4 '' 
no it does not , the material is very smooth so i do n't think if you paint it , it 'll look good . 
2 fixed shelves and 2 adjustable 
thank you for your question . the manufacturer lists the dimensions as 15 x 15 x 63 inches , which would include all overhangs and extensions . another way to look at it is this is the minimum overall `` footprint '' that the cabinet will fit into . thanks for looking ! home wishes 
product dimensions : 15 x 15 x 63 inches ; 48 pounds 
hi , it is white colour , thank you 
i guess it could be recessed but we just wall mounted it . it is a pretty cabinet . 
no it does not . 
mine measures just over 7 inches . the middle and top are adjustable . 
hello , it is white , pure white , thank you . 
hello , the back is board , yes , includes hardware to wall mount , thanks . 
the actual depth of each shelf is 7 1 4 ins . each shelf measures 21 1 2 ins . long . there are essentially 3 shelves to use . 
hello , the gap is approx 1.2 inches , thanks . 
hello , the top shelf is adjustable , thanks 
hello , we not ship there , sorry . 
12 inches 
yes it is and you can do your own homemade pizza , 
frozen are the only kind i have used . i do n't make them fresh 
it 's a good size . it 's 2 1 2 inches . i make pizza 's , warm up biscuits , make toast . we love it ! ! 
yes the handle does fold . 
yes , does a great job on hard floors , my only complaint is about dog hair on carpet . the power nozzle is not very heavy and i question the performance on carpet . 
no 
it needs just the nozzle you see in the picture which is a turbo nozzle . turbo nozzle means it has a powered agitator but instead of an electric motor the agitator is turned by air moving through a fan in the nozzle which turns a belt connected to the agitator . better then stright suction alone and not too agressive for bare floors . 
the wand can attachto the rear of the canister ( sort of a t shaped tab on the back of the nozzle which fits into a slot on the back of the canister ) so it does not fall over if you have to walk away or get interrupted . 
no , it 's 110v . 
along the front diagonal edge of the bottom shelf . the right side measures approximately 14 inches . hope this helps ! 
mine is 8 7 16 inches ( just shy of 8 1 2 inches ) from the counter top to the bottom of the first shelf . 
i would n't really recommend it . it 's not really very sturdy and it 's probably rather large in size to fit properly in a shower . 
we are very sorry to inform you that we do not sell it separately . 
mine was on the left side . hope it helps . 
they are connected together 
they match the shelves , so yes i would say they stainless steel . it is a nice sturdy shelf too , well worth the money . 
yes it does 
i believe the product description states 33 # . personally i would not exceed 20 # ( more or less ) . i really do like the pot rack . now that my `` pot supply '' is so handily & readily available , i find i am using pans i 've had for years but just did n't want to have to dig them out of the pile . would absolutely recommend this item . 
this pot rack is designed to mount on walls built using standard 16 '' stud centers . in my application , the screw holes are exactly 32 '' apart since i was able to locate it on a wall with standard stud placement . there is not a lot of room left for adjustment either , as both wall brackets are at either edge of the rack . so unless your window and trim are less than about 31 '' , this probably wo n't work there . 
yes it can be trimmed . you will have to trim both ends for your desired length . then drill matching holes in all six wooden strips . if you think you are handy enough to do this , then i would not hesitate purchasing this shelf . i love mine . 
the issue is going g to be more of how you plan on attaching the brackets and to what type of surface . otherwise this is pretty sturdy and supports a full set of my pans without any concern . 
you 'll want about a foot 
the shelf itself is 36 '' wide , and the mounting brackets can be used generally anywhere inside that space , but on both ends there is a thin metal rod that runs length wise to hold all the panels of the shelf together , those rods are 1 inch in on both sides , which means the space available for you to use for the mounting brackets is a little less than 34 '' total . hopefully that info will help you figure out if you can mount it around that window like you want , but i 'm guessing it wo n't fit well . 
no 
maximum holding weight is 33 lbs 
the installation is quite simple but the weight with pots would require a substantial base . i have mine mounted on a pine beam . 
the hooks can be in any of the 5 rows of gaps . 
it is 18 '' deep x 24 '' wide . the distance from the ceiling is adjustable via chain . ( max approx . 18 '' ) 
i do n't know what its rated for , but i think 70lbs would be ok. its probably close to the limit but all you would need is different hooks . the rack is easy to install and looks awesome . 
it has 4 separate hooks and it stays balanced just fine . i 've only had it for about two months , but have not noticed any issues . 
i think it just depends on how you reinforce it in your ceiling . i reinforced mine with crossing 2x4s in the rafters . i would be confident with the extra care it would hold at least some cast iron . 
all 4 need to go into the ceiling , that 's what i did and it turned out great 
1 1 2 '' x 18 '' x 24 '' 
you can , they have them shown on the instruction manual . i do n't have it with me . 
mine came with everything needed to put it up . biggest challenge was finding studs for the screw eyes in the location where we wanted it to hang over our island counter space . the chain supplied was twice as long as we needed to position it for easy access . 
quite a bit i have 8 pans on hooks all my spoons whisks cheese graters and on top i have pot my cast iron pans up there but what i did was made sure i used the beams in the ceiling you ca n't just put it up you have to find those studs i love it 
no 
yes you could . the wine bottle storage part is just two interlocking pieces of particle board , so you could easily leave that out 
wine rack can easily be not installed . it is the weakest and easiest part to install . 
its 4 to 5 inches in the front because of the curve in the bottom and 5.5 on the sides 
i do n't think so.it is tall enough to nest cereal bowls . 
yes , the entire piece . about an hour to complete , but easy to follow . 
black is the only color i have right now . have a great day . 
if you mean sitting on top it probably would depending on the weight . 
do you mean the same finished ? it that 's your question yes . i hope i answered your question 
13.5 '' deep , 15 '' wide , 11.25 '' tall 
yes , cheaply made . we received ours with no cutouts for the hardware and it was cut wrong . the hardware we did receive was not for this piece of furniture . do n't spend your money on this . 
no 
very good 
by how much water you put in your cup . 
impossible on this machine.. that is one of reasons i sent it back.. normal everyday coffee is not what you get.. plus the '' kcups '' are not all that readily available.it is an espresso machine.. and that is it . in my opinion not worth the money . 
i do n't now 
the water capacity is one issue , the heating element is probably the other ... less wait time between cups and a hotter cup of coffee 
its a 110v 
yep , super easy . just kind of snaps into and out of place for easy filling under the faucet . 
the capsules come as milk or coffee . fir instance the cappuccino would be made from 2 capsules ie 1 milk and 1 coffee . whereas the american houseblend is just 1 coffee capsule and you may want to add milk and sugar after depending on your preference . its teally easy to make though . i would definitely recommend it . 
mine has the normal american 120 v plug . not sure what you have in australia . but , converters are not hard to come by if you really want the machine . 
having restaurant experience , i went with stainless because it is more sanitary , does n't transfer odors , and keeps its original finish with repeated washings . i liked these so much , i ordered a second set for my neighbors . i have also found that stainless does not leech any metal taste into your drink . these really seem to keep your drink frosty cold too ! 
hello lois - india . hope that helps . mike 
i have used them for both moscow mules & hot buttered rum . happy drinking 
hello sandy - approximately 20oz . 
yes ! the traditional moscow mule recipe is printed on the box 
mine did n't . because i followed care instructions . wash them with luke warm soapy water and dry immediately 
it appears to be double walled 
these mugs are not solid copper . they are handcrafted from hygenic , easy clean stainless steel with a copper plated exterior and a solid brass easy-grip handle . the bottom is flat . 
ive had them a few months , no tarnish yet . 
the instructions say not to put it in the dishwasher or the microwave . 
as others stated , it will open any sized can . i have had mine for several years and the only limitation i have found is with cans having angles such as rectangles ( like sardines or spam ) or triangles ( like canned ham ) . with a bit of giggling you can still get it to make it around most corners . any sized round can -- not a problem at all . 
yes . very easy to use . 
there are instructions that come with it that tells you how to use the manual release 
greetings , you place two aa batteries and recommend , is an excellent product . 
the battery door is located on the side that faces the lid being removed . it uses aa batteries . 
not really . i just wipe it w a papertowel . does the trick if it does . 
do n't waste your money they do not last 
i think the answer to that is yes . however neither one of mine works at all . i 'm going to ask my son if he has some clue as to what makes them work but if he says no they are going into the trash . 
no 
i do not know never had a square can 
the very bottom middle is approximately 9-1 4 '' wide and widens up to 9-5 8 '' just under the 11 '' rim . the measurements are at the middle ( widest ) because the sides are gently curved like the ends are shown in the picture . it is a nice sturdy little pan . 
it 's beige with very fine specks of a dark brown . this is not very flexible like rubbermaid kind , but it 's not cheesy either . i liked the solidity , it served my purposes better , but it might crack easier than a more flexible plastic . 
the outside dimensions at the top from lip to lip is 13.5 ' long & 11 '' wide . 
regarding microban , the dish information did not disclose having been treated . however this appears to be a `` no name '' product being peddled by another party . i am very pleased with it . 
its really a small dishpan -- -- -- -- -- length is 13 1 2 inches , width 11 inches , both including lip . height is really only 5 inches , not 5 3 4 as stated . it was actually too small for my sink and i use it for other purposes . 
this straws are 9 '' long and 19 64 '' inches in diameter 
this straws have a permanent bumper at the end ... 
they are clear , and have held up very well . 
approximately 7 mm . they are not large like milkshake straws . they are slightly bigger than a standard drinking straw . i like them very much ! 
firm 
yes acrylic and bpa free 
stripes are black.. very nice shower curtain i love it ! 
hi my name is dina and i actually brought the leopard print bathroom shower curtain and also the bathroom leopard rugs , and to get to the point the color of curtains are leopard and the rugs are also leopard . so their really beautiful , hope that help , if u have any other questions you could email me at dlefort85 @ gmail.com 
6 ' by 8 ' 
i read reviews on both and they seem to be equal in quality . the question would be if nutriteam as a company stands behind its product - in terms of customer service , repairs etc - ike tribest does . otherwise i do n't see a difference . i personally would still prefer my tribest red and black one because of the high quality customer service at tribest . 
greetings ! yes ! : ) i 've `` juiced '' coconuts many times . absolutely delicious ! crack open the coconut , drain the water in a blender ( i have a vitamix ) ... .make sure the water is clear , not cloudy . crack out pieces of coconut , put in blender with coconut water , rough chop blend . feed into the tribest and watch as the milk pour out . yummy . i freeze the dry pulp in ice cube trays and use when blending smoothies ... .great fiber . i absolutely love my tribest . the banana and peach `` ice cream '' is amazing . i keep frozen fruits in the freezer to make the ice cream or sorbets . hope this helps . 
the model in our stock is the newer model . 
vertical auger juicers are `` adequate '' but not the best to juice wheatgrass . i have juiced wheatgrass in this machine and it does fine . but i '' m not juicing wheatgrass only , i 've combined wheatgrass with other ingredients . for this purpose it does well . if your looking to juice mostly or strictly wheatgrass i would look at the horizontal auger style juicers ie : omega 8006 or buy a dedicated wheatgrass juicer . if you looking to juice wheatgrass as well as other fruits and veggies then this does a good job . hope this helps 
yes . i put almonds in it to make almond milk . i just have to add them in with water . if you want to make nut butter you 'd have to use the mincer attachment . 
fully assembled it is about 20 inches with the plunger and not quite 18 inches without the plunger . it fits under my counter without the plunger ... i just leave it partially assembled and off to the side as i use it several times daily . 
i 've juiced greens , apples , grapes , melons ( honeydew and cantaloupe , maybe watermelon ) , citrus , beets , sweet potatoes , jalapeno peppers ( for a sauce ) , radishes , ginger , various herbs , etc . it does really well with all of that stuff , but with juicier stuff like melons and grapes you do tend to lose a little more liquid . i usually feed the pulp through the chute one more time if it feels wet . i 've found that starting with something dryer like greens or carrots makes the juicier stuff juice a little cleaner . in any event , i highly recommend this item : - ) 
if you clean this unit as soon as you make the juice you want ( i.e . before things dry on it ) it is super easy . rinse in water and use the brush on the fine metal filter and that 's it ! i adore this unit . i have juiced everything from beets , to carrots , to spinach . it 's an amazing unit and it gets daily use with no problems at all . i also use the other attachment to make shaved ice . that was a life saver during chemo . 
with the tribest sw-2000-b slow star juicer you use the mincing attachment to make nut butters . the mincing attachment uses the auger and not the screen . when you run nuts through the machine with the mincing attachment on , the nuts will come out almost powdery the first time through . you may want to run the nut ingredients through up to 5 times to get a creamy consistency . the more you run the nut mixture through , the creamery it gets . you also may want to add a little neutral tasting oil to you nut butter to increase the creaminess . many commercial nut butters have added oil . the oil can be added when the nuts go through the machine or after you are done running the nuts through the machine . i hope this information helps you . veggiesensations 
it really depends on the type of food you are juicing . if you are not doing leafy greens , the tribest may be better for you . it is faster than a horizontal auger juicer and adds versatility with its spout plug and its mincing attachment . to order please click on `` see seller 's offer '' below . 
it depends on the situation . in a sealed container with no extra source of moisture , indefinitely . in my incredibly damp garage about 30 minutes . they can be `` reactivated '' by baking in the oven and i have been experimenting with using low power settings in the microwave with some success . ( full power causes them to `` snap , crackle , and pop ) . i also bought some of the little humidity indicator cards so i can monitor the humidity in my containers . 
what you see in the picture is what you get . there is no address for a manufacturer or statement of origin . if it was made in the usa , my guess would be that it would say so . the seller - silicagel factory seems to be a chinese company and they also sell on alibaba . 
i would use 2 or 3 packets . that is how many i use in ammo cans that are about the same size . maybe change them once a year depending on the humidity and if you seal the boxes with duct tape . 
very good for food . my wife grows basil in our garden and we use a dehydrator to dry it when harvested . we do n't like to leave the basil in the dehydrator for too long because it becomes dark and less aromatic . i use the silica packets to store the basil in mason jars when they have become about 75 % dry from the dehydrator . the packets finish the drying process very well , keep the basil dry for much longer , and help retain taste and smell . a+ product . 
no , the bag is like a zip lock . open and reseal . i 've read elsewhere that you can bake these in the oven and it restores them to new but i 've never tried that . 
i dont have medical advice for how long to store meds , but if you are trying to keep moisture out of your prescription bottle this should be the ticket . the packets are sealed so they would n't touch your pills . use the small cc size ones . you should n't need more than one for a regular size rx . if you have a big bottle put 2 or three in the bottom out of your way . do n't waste money on multiple sizes these have many of them in the bag . 
you can either guess , or buy some of the little indicator cards that have little patches which turn from blue to pink . 
you 'd have to use a lot of them , preferably in a 'container ' that could be sealed . otherwise there would be no point . these are primarily meant for cameras and other sensitive equipment . i use them for small tools ( in containers ) that could rust . 
yes . i believe the directions are something like 220 for 2 hours . i personally put them into a food dehydrator for 2 hours at 165. i have some other kinds which have indicator crystals so you can tell when they are recharged and i do them all in one batch . so far , 2 hours at 165 seems to work just fine . if you have them in an oven , do keep an eye on them so the paper does n't scorch . 
yes you can . i think you may buy some tots like you buy at home depot-the extra large with yellow lids you cant miss them 12.50 each . place the silica packs about 2 of them on each tote with the books . then use plastic wire ties to tie the lids to the black bottom , 
yes , i saw that review , too . i will start by saying i have three cast iron teapots . a green one for green teas , a blue one for black teas , and this one for herbal , fruity or flavored teas . i do not scrub my cast iron teapots but i do wash and rinse them out from time-to-time . i have not observed anything flaking off in any of my teapots . this one appears to be just as good as the green one i purchased some years ago from teavana for almost double the price of this one . 
the color is exactly as it shows and the stand that comes with it is a big plus . i love this teapot . 
it fills a little more than two 8-oz mugs . not quite 3 . 
no they do not come with cups , unfortunately . it come with everything in the picture . it was a big hit with the person i bought it for ! highly recommended . 
i am not sure what your question is ... . the diameter is somewhere between 2-3 '' s ... i love mine ! ! ! 
no , cast iron is not tended to be used for a stove top . you want to boil the water then add it to the pot and step the tea . 
i do not know . there is no markings on it . sorry i could not help . 
yes it is . 
yes it is all stainless steelq 
i 'll do my best to answer this qustion . the inside diameter of the steamer basket is 9.5 inches at its ' widest point and 4 1 8th inches deep . the pot depth is 5 7 8 inches . when inserted , the steamer basked goes into the pot approximately 1 3 4 inches . i use this steamer regularly . in fact , i used it today to par-steam two pounds of brussels sprouts for freezing . i could not be happier with the product . it gets a great deal of use in my kitchen . 
hi keith , all `` claded '' ply- 3 , 5 , or the new 7 in stainless and mc2 , along with copper core , and copper cookware is made in canonsburg , pennsylvania . in other words , any item that has been cladded all the way from top to bottom , is usa made . if any item is a clad bottom only- does not go all the way up the pot or pan , like the one pictured , it is made in china . the `` b3 '' anodized is also made in china as it is not clad all the way . hope this helps . 
yes 
this is made in china . 
i frequently use the pot to cook pasta both 1 lb and 1 2 lb , it works great . i have a separate collander to strain the pasta so i do n't use the steamer for this particular application . 
was it w soap immediately after use . do n't let it sit after use . 
metal and it seals well 
works beautifully on my induction ! 
perforations are on the bottom as well as the sides . i love this steamer . i use it more than any other pan well worth the money ! 
yes it is . although i lay my rack on its side because it is too tall for my shelf . it will hold my cast iron on its side and also when i put the shelf upright too . 
they are 3 '' wide . also , unless you want to screw the rack into the cabinet , just lay it on it 's side . i have very heavy pans , and it would tip over every time i would take one out , so i just put it on its side and slid the pans in , and it works perfectly , and gives you an extra space to add another pan or lids . 
probably not . my thick frying pot wo n't fit . 
it is about 12 inches tall . 
i use a straw , but yes it would get as hot as the beverage . 
small -- like the standard size straw from a restaurant . i had gotten some plastic reusable and they work well . sometimes cap gets `` stuck '' like suctioned and is hard to open , fyi , but i still like it for my drinks on the go ! 
this lid fits a standard regular mouth jar . standard canning jars are available in regular and wide mouth . 
yes , the two top pieces are separate but is installed such that one section can be made to slide over the other ; the sliding is smooth too . 
is made in china . 
the dimensions of the little modern table and chairs are l 28in x w 19 in x h 20 in and weighs 17.3 lbs . 
it holds a pint ... i am a pig so i would want to drink a little more smoothie . but the lid does not leak and has a built in rubber gasket . 
not really sure how many exactly , to be honest . but it 's a little bigger than a soda can , if that helps . 
yes ! small mouth mason jars : ) 
i think so . the picture looks like the jars i have too . hope they work for you 
yes the rack does come with all of the spices as well as free refils for them for five years from the purchase date 
about 4 '' h x 1 1 2 '' w 
it 's in a plastic bag , it looks like a card . 
i order my spices online from penzeys spices 
i ca n't answer this for ya i got it for a gift for my dad but it 's a good size ! 
everything except for pepper 
yes that are 
it 's actually 2 seperate beds that sit side by side inside of a king size bed frame . each bed operates seperately and independently of each other . 
yes , they do have a silky sateen finish , are very soft and i love mine.. 
no , they are made for a 2xtwin xl adjustable bed . that is called a split king 
they were perfect for my split sleep number . not sure for sleep comfort 
yes 
a corner ripped out wo n't buy again ! 
hi richard , here is the asin for the pillowcases b00eclyrdy 
sorry i do n't know what you mean . all i can say is these sheets are the best i 've ever had for my bed . 
our split king is 2 xl twin mattresses that are side by side but can move up and down separate from each other . 
the sheets fit our tempurpedic split remote bed . it should fit yours . 
yes , we have about 10 different colors . please click on our company 's name on the listing ( royal hotel bedding ) then click on royal hotel store front and search our items for all split-king sheets with color you desire and they should come up . 
i do n't know , but the sheets are nice , they are comfortable and soft . 
yes they work- we elevate the head of the bed to make putting the sheets on easier 
13 '' front to back , 12 '' side to side , 8 '' tall ... ... ... .love them . have countless of the medium and small ... .organized my pantry ! 
definitely . i attached mine to a wooden board and put fruit and veggies in them so i think just the wall would be fine . 
no , the top of the box is slightly wider than the bottom so they would not easier stack . 
china 
no , it 's more square , i use it to hold my kitchen towels . 
the back and sides all angle in slightly as they go down , they are not quite 90 degrees but very close . 
no . 
pretty sure they are 12 x12 x8 inches tall ( nice basket ) 
it is 7.75 '' h x 12 '' w x 13 '' d 
17 '' wide , 12 '' tall , 7 '' deep 
no . will hold standard 0.75 liter bottles and maybe a little bigger . 
it will hold a standard 750ml bottle of wine . anything with a large round bottom like a champagne bottle or larger 1.5l bottles will not fit in this . pinot and chardonnay will be fine as long as they 're normal bottles . 
no it might prove dangerous to your lovely bottles of wine . 
regular wood 
china 
width : 17 '' , depth : 6.7 '' , height : 11.6 '' 
width : 17 '' , depth : 6.7 '' , height : 11.6 '' 
no . 
there are only 12 but we found them cheaper at walmart and dollar tree 
i have not had a problem with them on a high setting . 
when i bought 12 , 12 came ! think picture is same regardless if what description says 
it does not say on the label so i do n't think so . 
no , you do not add water . the unit collects water over time that you must drain from time to time . 
yes . it comes with the 4 '' hose . you *could* run it without , but i would n't recommend it because otherwise it would be like running a heater and an ac unit both at the same time . they can get away with it at hardware stores , because the store itself is not reliant on the portable ac unit 's cooling . i would n't trust any portable ac unit that did n't have a way to pump the hot air out . also , i 've used these units in sliding glass doors . the way i did that was take a piece of wood that fit inside the door , say 7 ' x 12 '' and cut a hole with a jig saw big enough for the ac 's exhaust vent hose . then i just screwed the vent to the wood and could close the screen door and still have the ac working . i 've seen people run the exhaust hose through floors before , say in a crawl space , but my opinion is heat rises and that could make the floor hot and might make the motor run hotter . 
no 
yes , i believe it will . pretty much anything in the 10k to 15k draws quite a bit of amperage . i made sure mine were plugged into a plugs that were pretty much isolated . you definitely do not wand it plugged into a line that also runs computers , tv 's , stereos , etc . it will cause undue wear on those , or anything with an electronic brain and could cause an early death . ( seen it . ) sometimes by just re-arranging appliances you can even things out and save yourself a headache later on . 
no ! it 's a pain to drain . but you do n't have to drain it a lot , unless it 's very humid . it does have some nice fitures , the oscillating fan and the energy saver mode . also it was $ 400.00 at home depot . amazon $ 259.00 . i have ( 2 ) of these , no drain hose . good luck finding one with correct size thread . 
dusty is a decent size for a sheet cake . about 5-5 1 2 `` across the wings and the body about 6 '' long . it comes with a plastic `` dish '' it sits in on the cake . it made a really cute cake decoration . and it 's something the child can keep . 
yes , with the other piece showing a picture of two planes . 
this product is just the plastic pieces that go on the cake and can not be eaten . we brought this photo , which includes the product and the cake , to a bakery and had them frost their cake to match the photo . 
to be honest , i dont know . but remember the whitlpool owns maytag so it might be work . go to the sears parts website and type the serial and model number and look on the diagram for the number which represents the heater core and it will give the part replacement number . then you copy paste the number and paste it on google or bing and it will give website the have the part for sale , look if amazons is there if not copy paste the part number and do the same but on amazons . hope it work for you , thats what i did to find the part ... 
well is under whirpool oem , so i would say it is and it was exactly like the one i removed ... 
do n't really know , but since the heater has it 's own thermostat which is attached to the top tube of the freezer 's evaperator coil , it probably itself off when the temperature reachs 32 degrees f inside the freezer , my understanding is that the heater turns on when the timer shuts off the system , in my case , every 8 hours . 
my machine is a kenmore that did fit the whirlpool timer but i am far from an expert and i am unsure about the answer to your question . i would suggest contacting someone at http : www.appliancepartspros.com as they were able to answer a similar question for me when i made my purchase . good luck 
hello , our company only sells parts in new condition , never re-manufactured . there is a 90-day manufacturer 's warranty on all whirlpool parts . thank you . 
the description should list all kenmore parts that it is capable of replacing . 
have to disagree with that answer . just to clarify ... to make a 12 oz mug of coffee , i press the `` + '' button once , and then the `` start '' button . on the third morning after i 'd gotten the t55 , mine ran out of water in the middle of brewing a mug . it stopped the brewing process . not knowing exactly what to do , i refilled the tank , crossed my fingers , and pressed the start button ... and it finished brewing the mug , releasing the correct amount of water , without overflowing . as explained in my review of the t55 , the tank 's water level is clearly visible from the front of the machine , through a `` window '' , when there is no cup on the holder . the top of the window is just above the `` max fill '' line , and the bottom of the window is about half-an-inch above `` empty '' . to brew a 12 oz mug , the water level needs to be about 1.5 '' above the bottom edge of the window . i do n't use the water-filter or its holding-tank ; simply filling the main tank with filtered water , instead . this allows me to brew four 12 oz mugs before needing to refill the tank . 
they make a reusable t-disc that you can add whatever coffee you prefer into ; http : www.my-cap.com my-cap-products-for-tassimo-brewers reusable-t-disc-for-tassimo-brewers-detail.html 
absolutely . tea , hot chocolate , espeesso , latte , capps , regular and decaf coffee . 
no . the t-disc has a barcode , which the machine reads and then determines which size drink you are to brew with that disc . once the brewing process is finished , however , there is an option to `` hold for more '' ( or something similar ) , which allows the user to customize the amount of water which is brewed into the cup . the side of the t-disc package shows the proper cup size to be used for that particular brew . 
i believe you can put the descaling disc in the machine and when you run it it dispenses hot water . you may want to check their website to verify that . holding down the brew button makes it descale but pushing it once normally should just fill the cup with hot water . 
yes 
110 
yes , a filter came with it . i have filtered water from my refrigerator door so i never replaced the filter in the machine . it works great . 
yes 
i just take the water reservoir and wash it with hot soapy water and rinse it . never had an issue with the machine being dirty . 
yes that is how i am using it on a metal bed frame . 
i love it . i have had the regular type of mattress and to me this is by far so much better . yes i believe it is too a hybrid mattress compared to the innerspring and foam . i hope this helps . i would definitely recommend this mattress . 
it is comfortable . but no way is it ( 11 '' tall ) more like 9 '' 
i love this mattress ! ! ! ! i bought the metal frame amazon suggested with it and its amazing-no box spring needed ! ! ! ! im still laughing at how this thick beautiful mattress arrived rolled and vacuumed packed and then morphed into a big fat fluffy mattress ! ! ! my only regret was not getting it sooner ! ! ! 
yes . there are mattress frames that remove the need for a box frame that work great . 
no . it 's delivered by ups . call a local goodwill . they might come get your old mattress . 
with all of the components put together the bed is at a correct height . for some folks it would depend on what their `` regular height '' would be them . 
yes it was , but the mattress itself would be what i would call a medium support mattress . 
yes , of course . 
hi , it comes with one year warranty.we are using more than 5 months . it 's worth to buy it . 
yes i too suffer from back pain this mattress has done wonders for my back pain 
yes 
no , it ca n't be flipped over . 
if it 's one of these beds you can set up in different positions , like rise your legs and or the upper part of the body , no . it will not work 
it is `` rolled and compressed '' for shipping convenience . it is much easier to ship small things in size than it is to ship big things . about 24-48 hours . 
no - i have not experienced anything like that . 
i 'm not a seller- 
i ca n't speak to flame retardants , not sure , but did n't notice any nasty smell . the bed feels like a regular mattress and has been fine for a 200+ lb guest . 
no discernible difference - it just sleeps very comfortably ! 
the instructions said to allow 48 hours but as soon as i unrolled it and gave it like 10 minutes , it was already 9 inches high . i left it for about 36 hours and it was great after that . 
i been using this bed for the last 1 year and do not see any problems till now . it is great ! 
yep . it 's a great bed . 
mostly medium , especially after you get beyond the first 6 inches from the edge . the 6 inches to the edge , you will roll off until you get used to it . otherwise , medium . 
about 24 hours . 
no , it sits right on the 12 point base we purchased to go with it , no box spring needed . 
sorry but i hsve no idea 
yes it would be fine for a 2 yr old so comfortable 
not sure we had a box spring we just put it on top of that . no problems . it is a good mattress . 
oh my god are you serious hippy ? shaking my head and walking away.. wow.. 
mine was kept in its original box while we moved . it came out just fine . when you take it out of the box just give it an hour and you have a great mattress . i got it for my mom and she loves it . it really doesnt matter how long its in the box because thats how they are at the warehouse and that could be a long time . glad i could help , enjoy the mattress . sandy 
yes , i did n't like them . you can see the paper around the cup . it 's put together cheaply 
yes 
they do not come with lids or carrying case . they come in a paper box and you have to purchase the lids separately . i bought them for myself . 
i gave these as a wedding present to a couple i hang out with quite often , and they said they really liked them and used them often . they drink a lot of coffee . therefore , i am assuming they are safe for coffee ! 
it does come with lids 
no and no . tumblers only . 
yes- all four pictures are on the cup 
there is only 1 tumbler . it is a great tumbler and recommend it if you are a golden girl fan . 
yes 
it 's not painted . it 's a printed paper insert . 
the top is 6 1 8th wide and has 5 1 4 in width between the rails . hope this helps . 
i do n't mm know if there are wider options but is does mount to the `` floor '' of the cabinet . 
i would say that it could be set into a cabinet , but you would lose the ability to pull it out without items falling all over and tipping out of it if you can not fasten it to something stationary . mine is mounted under the kitchen sink and it would not be useful if i could not pull it out to access items in the back . 
the rails are not very high , about two inches high . but that is enough to hold bottles under the kitchen sink . it does slide out all the way , for this reason you need to use screws when you are installing it . the screws that are provided are fairly small , but they have held up for the past 6 months . 
jonathan - these are 3 separate units , so yes , you see the transition from one unit to another . if you have the units on a hard-surfaced floor , and you put the units together correctly , the transition will be hardly noticeable . the units are dark , so if you are standing a distance from them , the transition is difficult to see . our units are on a carpeted floor , so it takes some extra effort to make sure you have them level in all directions in order to avoid a visible separation . if you want something that looks like one unit , one that shows no transition , then you need to have a single unit built . we are very pleased with these units . they look nice and the quality , for the money paid , is great . ours are loaded with books and pottery and other small art pieces , and they look great . hope this helps . 
i just measured mine- 82 inches ( 6 feet and 10 inches ) 
this particular item has 3 pieces . you can also by them separately if you want but the listings will be different . 
it ship via fedex ground . they do not bring it inside . 
hello . it is made of engineered wood with a scratch and stain resistant laminate finish . 
dear ms heckrotte : thank you for your email . please note item # 96351 , `` floral bouquet shower curtain '' is made of polyester and is machine washable . a liner is optional . if you have any further questions , please feel free to contact us again . thank you for contacting collections etc . on amazon ! 
i have this in my shower and it is not sheer , but not completely opaque . ( if i put my hand behind it , i can see my hand , but it is n't see through either . ) i am using a liner and am pleased with it . 
the background is a pale gold 
dear mr bradford : thank you for your email . please note we do not carry the item you are seeking at this time . we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause . thank you for contacting collections etc . on amazon ! 
4 '' wide by 8 '' tall . width of the mouth ( open ) 2 3 4 '' 
8in tall , 4in wide and 13in around . it holds more food than i need for a filling lunch . 
710 ml . 
china 
no . i doesnt 
tell me how many cups you want to fit in it using a measuring cup and i will pour the amount you want in mine and report back to you . 
yes depending on the size of your hand 
actually that hole is important . first , if anyone was to try to fire a ceramic piece that thick , it would likely shatter . second , it helps air get into the handle when you cook , making the handle cooler when you get ready to serve the tasty stuff to your guests . i have had good luck with these , by the way . 
alas , like just about everything else , they 're made in china . wish they were n't but ... 
they appear to be the same . if i read the ad right on amazon they 're asking $ 60 ? i would buy off of the other site for half that . they 're nice soup crocks but really , do they need to cost all that much ? it is soup after all . however , they are a good buy at $ 30 . enjoy them whatever you decide ! merry christmas happy holidays ! 
i 've never tried that , but i am guessing that if you put your bowls in the oven to bake the cheese on top you would find them too hot to handle . 
it - the handle - warms up a little ( yes it is touchable ) in microwave but does n't get too hot to touch . 
no 
chef 's catalog ( click 'details ' tab ) says they 'll hold 20 oz -- http : www.chefscatalog.com product 29623-chefs-french-onion-soup-bowls.aspx others have answered a similar question and have said a little less -- which is probably more realistic , unless you always fill to the brim . 
about 2 1 4 cups , good sized , i love them , especially for french onion soup . 
sorry , i do n't have an answer to that question . i would say it is a standard medium sized bowl , but i know that is not much help . when i get home i will see if i can use a measuring cup to give you an answer . i am planning on making onion soup tonight anyway . 
yes they 're broiler safe . i just stick them in for a couple of minutes until the cheese bubbles and starts to brown slightly . these bowls are great ! 
design goes all around three sides but not under pillows 
89by89 
go to octorose.com ... .they have the curtains that match this spread . 
yes just like in the picture . pillow shams 
we have one set for the bed -- excellent . if you have a queen , order a king size so it reaches the ground . 
i 'm sorry but we do not offer the matching curtains and not aware where they are sold . we apologize for inconvenience . 
you should say are there pillows . there are pillow shams and you use your own pillows . 
david , thank you for your inquiry . the is just the quilted cover and 2 shams . depending on the depth of your bed and or box spring dimensions , it 's hard to say if this will drape all the way to the floor . the queen size is 90 '' x 90 '' , and the king is 94 '' x 102 '' . so best advice would be to measure this out and see what will suit your needs best . if you have any other questions i would be more than happy to answer them . 
thr curtains is 2panels each is 60x84 .. 
comes in queen if you order it just send me email that you need queen i will send you queen.. 
no , it means there are 3 jars in the package , and there is just one package -- 3 jars total . 
appx 20 oz , and works amazing at keeping cold drinks cold . 
not unless the holder is large . they do not fit in mine ... in a toyota sienna . 
they are made of thick plastic ! 
yes 
yea you actually do , i stopped using it because of that . 
what a great thought ! yes , i do n't see why not ... 
yes . it is great for light ironing or pressing . ironing a dress shirt or a linen dress would be difficult because of limited space and the surface being entirely flat . i have creased jeans , touched up silk blouses and ironed capris with ease . mine is used on top of my washing machine , and having a hard surface helps . for touch-ups it should work fairly well on a bed . hope this helps . 
fits nicely on my maytag washer , 321 2 in . by 181 2 in . ( slight difference than quoted size ) . good quality , strong magnets to hold it . i find it so much easier to use than the ironing board for my pressing for sewing and small jobs . i like it . 
yes ... .it 's a great substitute 
absolutely ! in fact , i have used it in my granite countertop and my wood table . the mat is completely cool underneath after using . 
i was wondering that myself ! seems a tad steep to me . 
i would n't , since it 's not thick enough to protect the table from heat . 
can be used on any flat surface . 
there are magnets on the 4 corners only . 
no its plastic 
read the reviews- no size fits , which is why imho somebody should go to jail for calling these `` mason '' tumblers . 
most definitely . you will never have to worry about a mug cracking from freezer temps . 
8.5 '' long with a 5 16 hole 
i would not put hot liquid in it 
no , it does n't sweat and does not leave a mark on tables or countertops when you set it down 
i do n't know if there is supposed to be a soapy liquid inside the mug , ,it is not described with one and i do n't see any in the mugs that i have . i do n't know what good a soapy liquid would be inside the insulated part of the mug because no water gets in there . i have washed them by hand and machine several times and there is no indication of soap anywhere if you have soap in one , i suggest you contact the manufacturer or amazon . 
the straw is a large size . i would compare it to a large green frappuccino straw from starbucks . i never had bubble tea with boba , so i do n't know the answer to that question . my suggestion would be to go on the aladdin website and ask them . http : www.aladdin-pmi.com collections mason-tumbler . i love these tumblers . i have about 8 of them . they are truly sweat proof and they wash well in the upper rack of the dishwasher . 
it does not fit in the cup holders in my vehicle . 
not to have it in front of me to measure at the moment and thinking of a 12 inch ruler i would say between 9-10 inches high 
hamilton beach came out with a new version in october which does do k-cups . the prior version did not do them . if the travel mug is on the right side as you are looking at the coffee maker , that version does the k-cups . if the travel mug is on the left side of the coffee maker as you are looking at the brewer , it does not do k-cups . 
when you put the kcup in you need to make sure the holder for it is completely flat . that should help with the coffee grounds . for the smell , i would run some white vinegar through it and that should hopefully take care of it . the weakness depends on how much water you put in . i know you probably know all of this but this is all i know . i love mine . 
adjustable cup rest fits a standard cup or up to a 14 oz . travel mug ( not included ) 
yes it does ! 2 i 'm fact , one for each side 
no 
i know exactly what you mean , but there is no option to control the temperature . 
the heater is under the carafe side so it does get hot when using the mug side but turns off once the mug is done . leaving the carafe on the hot plate is no problem 
is it switched to the carafe ? and on the k cup the lever needs to be pushed down 
i am an electronics engineer and usually any burnt smell from equipment or appliances is not a good sign . it takes quite a bit of curent to boil the water in the coffe maker . make sure the cord or plug are not getting hot to the touch . if the plug is getting hot you might have a loose connection or defective power receptacle in the wall . if the plug is not getting hot and the smell is from the inside of the coffee maker i would call the company with the model number and the serial number . it can be hard to read but it is stamped on the bottom . if the device is under warranty they should send you a new one . this burnt smell could be a safety issue so call them and tell them you have a safety concern . try 1-800-851-8900. i 'm still lovin my hamilton beach machine . ron in virginia beach 
the single serving side is a very small gold filter basket designed for just one cup of coffee . no paper filter is needed . it works fine with just the gold filter . not sure they even make a paper filter that small ; 0 ) 
you can choose to heat milk without froth . 
yes it is 
i do not know the exact number of ounces that it will froth at once , but there is a different amount you add for frothing a latte vs. a cappuccino - there are lines marked inside that you fill to . just generally speaking , it is enough for one serving at a time . i have it in the office and it is fine to froth for each individual 's drink - it is pretty fast , so not generally a problem . 
you 'd need a step-down adapter of some sort to 110v 
the inside is a teflon coated surface . it is not very deep - the bottom is only about 4 inches from the top lip and the frother attachement pops out so it is very easy to clean . 
never found out , it only worked twice . 
it only worked twice and then quit . i returned it . 
yes , but it quit working shortly after i purchased it - less than 3 months of use . 
i 've had mine for almost a year and no problems . it does n't take long for the milk to froth and we really like ours . the inside is no-'stick , but you ca n't remove it so be careful when cleaning to not get the underside wet . 
mine never worked . the milk was lukewarm at best . 
it is black . 
it appears to be a high-grade aluminum -- except for the handle , which is plastic , and the feet , which are hard rubber . it 's a great cane -- the more i use it the more i like it . 
it was a gift for my mom so i do n't have it here but i am guessing it is approx . 2 '' -3 '' in diameter . 
trusty cane has five length adjutments 
i do n't have the cane here to measure as it was for my mom but ... it has several heights it can be adjusted to . if it goes to 30 '' , surely it would go down to 28 '' . my mom is 4'9 '' and it is a bit to tall for her . 
it is real and it does stand by itself . 
push the button on the handle . 
no we do not . sorry 
do n't know , but i will not let my mil even use this cane , not safe ! got her a hurricane instead . 
if you google trusty cane you will find numerous references to a scam 
no this is just the twin sheet set you have to buy the comforter separate 
yes 
no 
the set has a comforter and it is very nice . i got it for my granddaughter for christmas . 
it does not come with the comforter . one fitted sheet , one flat sheet , and one pillow case is what i got in the twin sheet set . 
no , we only got the sheet set , no comforter . 
this is only the sheet set . it comes with one fitted , one flat , and one pillow case . the comforter comes separately . hope this helps you . 
lisa , thank you for bringing this listing discrepancy to our attention . the actual warranty is indeed 10 years and we 've updated all our listings accordingly . customer service 
yes . this mattress is covered by a 10 year limited warranty . please retain your receipt as your warranty record . thank you . 
4 lbs is the density of the foam . please let us know if you have any more questions . 
i do n't think it would be too much of a problem but we were pretty careful about putting it in an extra room on the floor spread out and leaving the window open to let it air out and expand as much as physically possible . we gave it a few days to make sure it was good to go . if you do n't have enough room to do that , then i would continue flipping it on each side upright so that it does n't unevenly expand . 
according the seller , the units are the same , but the `` w '' means it was a batch manufactured for walmart stores . 
distilled water . not just with your panasonic l70srw any iron that uses water . 
if you meant what is the difference between the ni-l70sr and the ni-l70srw , the w is simply the color designation for white but it is sometimes left off . 
nothing . the w was an inventory designation originally intended for a big box retailer . it appears on the invoice but not on the product or packaging . 
the product specifications state : 120 volts ac ; 60hz .

one year limited warranty to defects or workmanship 
maybe 2 pounds . 
yes . it 's a retractable cord . you just give it a slight tug and it is self winding . 
no it is not . i bought it for our pool house . it 's thin , and actually kinda cheap looking . but then it 's only a curtain liner . 
i think you have to contact the seller directly for that request . 
jana , it is plastic , and more see through , i think , than the photo shows because it is not as heavy feeling as the one i have in my bathroom . the one they have hanging in the picture almost looks like it could be two shower curtains back to back , because the one they sent is definitely clear plastic expect where the sea shells and stars are placed some of which are very yellow , not as pictured at all . good luck with your purchase . they sent it quickly so the customer service in that regard was good . it 's the return to china that gets way too much . 
no , and it 's pretty thin , not one of the more heavy-duty shower curtains . 
the colors are baby blue , light brown , cream and beige on a clear shower curtain . 
it is frosted ; however , not enought that you could n't see through ( you would be able to `` see '' one 's shape , but not details . ) i would not call it clear . i bought an inside white panel to go with it so that it would become totally `` non see through . '' hope this helps . 
yes but it does n't take that long 
31 inches 
hello , the seat height is at 24 inches . best regards , netrush 
hello , yes , these stools do swivel . best regards , netrush 
no they do not 
never counted them but it looks like 500 
if i had to guess i would say about 5 cups of pop corn give or take a cup . 
made in the u.s.a. as written on the bottom of the bag .

no , but not hard to put together-just put legs on and maybe drawer hardware if i remember .

hello donald- thank you for your interest in designer living . unfortunately , at this time , we do not ship outside of the united states . sincerely , samantha designer living customer service 1-888-879-8790 info @ designerliving.com 
yes 
hello robin s , yes it can be delivered to your apartment . please be advised it is at the discretion of the ups driver to leave a package if you 're unavailable . connie designer living customer service 925-583-9114 info @ designerliving.com 
200 square feet sounds very large too me for what this will do . i will say it is rewarding to empty it each day , but it only holds maybe a cup or two of water ... .it makes a dent in my 100 square foot bathroom but 200 sounds pretty big ... 
`` service '' usually means the amp draw off of the breaker panel 
for that size area u may want to consider a larger dehu . mine gathers 8oz per day in my laundry room 8x6 and master bath 12x14 so you 'd be emptying it all the time . 
absolutely not , you need a bigger machine to do this . 
i think only the color . it 's quiet , and even though it 's small it has made a noticeable difference in the air quality . i have it in my basement and the dank odor is gone . works great . 
the cord is about 2-3 feet and yes it can be used with an extension cord 
this plugs into the wall ... . i had in on for over 4 hours and it gathered about 1 tablespoon of water ... .. its extremely humid here . 
this little dehumidifier is great for dehumidifying damp rooms but i believe this will not work like an exhaust fan for bathrooms . sorry if this is not what you want to hear but it sounds like you would need someone to install an exhaust fan for your bathroom . good luck ! 
not sure if voltage is adjustable . 
sorry but i believe you will need more than one for your apartment . we have 1 in the bathroom and it works great , but i think you will need 1 or 2 more depending on how big your apt is and how much moisture you have . hope i answered your question . 
yes it is waterproof . keep in mind that it is very thin but totally waterproof 
so far , it 's been great for my four year old . he 's had a few accidents while it 's been on the bed and nothing has gotten through to the mattress . 
i felt more at ease putting them to bed knowing that the mattress would n't be wet in the morning . for me , it did help with bedwetting and potty training . 
we do not recommend putting the mortar and pestle in the dishwasher . 
the swissmar granite mortar and pestle is made in china . 
the well is 3 '' dia and approximately 2 '' deep at the deepest point . the pestle is approximately 5 '' l . 
the cross-section is about 3 32 x 3 32 inch for potatoes , slightly thinner than 1 8 inch and thicker than 1 16 inch . by your measure , the thickness is less than 1 2 of a ( wood ) lead pencil . hope this helps . 
unfortunately there is no any type of guard comes with this slicer . but i like it anyway . 
no . it would be way too thin . actually i did n't even like it for julianne veggies . too thin ! 
i do not think it will work ... .surely you can just use a knife . it works so well for harder fruit and veg ... .celeriac or beetroot are a dream once grated with this 'machine ' 
germany 
i have this and i ca n't imagine how you would do onion straws from this . i have the waffle attachment it would not work with that either . 
i think that you can use it for hard cheese , but i think it is not a best stuff for this . i use it for carrots and this is really good . 
no this is the best crock pot i have ever owned ... .quality ... .i am going to get another one ... 
to hold six quarts , you must fill it all the way to the very top , spilling over . filled only to the ledge , on top of which the cover rests , it will only hold five quarts . apparently , this a very common misrepresentation of slow cookers ' true cooking capacity . 
yes . 
yes if you want to take out the center and put it on the table..i love this crock it is the best one i have . i love that it locks so it is easy to transfer place to place if you have to . 
this is our only istir slow cooker currently available . the stir attachment is suitable for use with slow cooker models sccpvc650as-x , sccpvc600as-x , sccpvp650as-x or sccpvp600as-x . 
the measurements are approximately 10 '' long ( bottom ) , 11.5 '' long ( top ) , 7.5 '' wide ( bottom ) , 9 '' wide ( top ) , 4.5 '' deep . this slow cooker is oval . 
at this time , we do not have a unit with those specific features . we appreciate your feedback and this will be forwarded to our product design team . 
yes , two latches that hook over the rim of the ceramic pot insert . 
yes , this unit will automatically switch to warm after the cooking cycle is finished . 
4 , 6 , 8 , or 10 hours , but relatively meaningless as it boils even on `` warm '' 
1.5 inch upper diameter and 5 16th lower diameter 
the stem outer diameter is about 3 8 in , inner diameter is 1 4 in ( the metal curves inward at the bottom , the sheet metal used is about 1 64 in thick . the mouth outer diameter is 1 7 32 in , inner diameter is 1 6 32 in ( metal is bent out in a lip all around as you can see from the picture ) . total height of the funnel is 1 in . mouth and stem are both 3 8 in deep , the actual funnel portion is 1 4 in deep . 
unfortunately we do n't ship outside usa . 
i have the simple home creations 16 x 11.5 '' mat . works fine . it has 12 circles , 1.5 '' in diameter , and 1.5 '' apart . i do n't use the circles because i try to get more than 12 of whatever i am baking on the mat . 
there are 12 circles , they 're about 1 3 4 '' and spaced about 1 3 4 '' . they work really nice for spacing out cookies so they do n't touch . 
i 've never made macarons but everything i 've baked on it has come out great . no stick and extremely easy to clean . it 's heat resistant to 430f . 
so far , i have just used these mats for my cookies and they look like brand new still . i have had similar experiences with other mats and just threw those out . 
there is a smooth silicone coating over the fiberglass mesh . your baked goods slide right off the mat when they are done . i love this mat ! 
it 's around 1mm 
yes , you can place them in the freezer and freeze them with out a problem . you can even use the mats in a microwave . they 're very durable ( and versatile ) . 
im not worried about it . its in between the layers of food grade silicone . all the other brands of non stip baking mats are made of the same thing . i love mine ! they make baking and clean up so easy . 
it fits a half baking sheet . 
i used it to cook fish and it worked great ! it was really easy to clean up . 
they sent 4 but 2 were damaged 
that should be fine , but , these are made so cheap they tear up before you can even get them under the bed . i purchased some from another company that was very good , then i purchased these . very disappointed . 
yes you get 4 of them in the order at that price 
i have mainly used it for drying pots and pans . i had the few times i use silverware i put them thru the wires to stay in place . 
bare 
about 9 inches . 
nope . not a bit 
absolutely . it would stay in place . works very well . no silverware bin though . 
we had the same problem . i forgot why my husband said it happened , but we sent it back to crane and they replaced it with a new one that works perfectly . : - ) 
no , it 's does n't lock . the tank part on top lifts up off the bottom part , just like most humidifiers . 
no , but i can run from 8p to 8a on one tank . 
i used distilled water you can buy at your local grocery store . 
i 'd said you would obviously know it is there and on , but your child may not . we use it every night and so much better than the big box options . 
nope . no filter required . nothing required but water . we love ours ! works well . 
why would you want to ? ? ? if you are referring to flashpoint by adorama it is a bowens mount already . you just unfold and mount to your flashpoint strobe . just so you know bowens , travelite , calumet and flashpoint all use the same mount ( bowens `` s '' type ) . 
this is built around flash lights not continuous . the material is not heat resistant and the beauty dish would limit the amount of light output by the unit . also , the bowens mount is intended for flash heads . 
hey there ! the phottix luna 27.5 '' folding beauty dish includes a bowens speed ring which can attached to all paul c buff products . however , you can not use the paul c buff speed ring with this as it 's already configured and collapsible with the bowens speed ring . hope this helps ! 
i use and recommend the neewer s-type bracket holder with bowens mount for speedlite flash ( available on amazon around $ 20 ) . it 's far easier to mount and operate than the other bowens speedlite adaptors . 
yes 
if your promaster lights have a bowens type mount they will work . 
yes , but not for the inside . it 's covers the front of the beauty dish . 
i do n't , but wanted to add that i have two broken rods and have only used it a few times . i love the product but for the breakage . 
no it does n't it just works with bowens mount 
sure , you 'd just have to obtain the disk . 
it 's a 4 '' paring knife . 
i measured one of them @ ~1 16 '' thick . `` high carbon '' and `` high carbon stainless '' are not the kinds of terms i would look for . these knives are vg-10 steel , which is a high performance stainless steel- with what could be called a `` high carbon '' content of ~1 % . the chromium ( @ 15 % ) is what makes it stainless , and in this case , vanadium , molybdenum , cobalt , and manganese factor into the overall steel equation . it holds an edge remarkably well , while offering superior corrosion resistance . i put mine to a honing steel somewhat regularly , and sharpen maybe ever 3 months- but i like to maintain a shaving edge on these knives . they take the edge easily and hold on to it fantastic ( using dmt diamond and then ceramic stones to polish ) . i have to say , i think it really depends on your own habits . these probably are n't ideal if you like to cut with more tight gripped downward pressure than a balanced slice . they 're exceptional performing knives , but i think they 're meant as more of a finesse instrument than a chopping tool . in my opinion , the balance and weight is great , the quality of the construction is obvious , and these are some of the best kitchen knives on the market . with fine diamond stones ( i prefer dmt ) and ceramic , they are very easy to maintain ( a few minutes is usually all it takes to get it back to a scary shaving edge ) -- but i would n't use them as cleavers in any sense whatsoever . if you 're into finesse and slicing over brute-force chopping , i could n't recommend these higher . 
i 'm sorry . we do not ship to germany . 
the shun premier line is a more round handle . i 'm right handed and my girlfriend is left handed , and the knives fit perfect for both of us . i do n't believe she would have any problems with the premier line . 
yeah , it is 
we sell through amazon canada . 
to military addresses , we ship u.s. postal via the lowest-cost method , since we offer free shipping . 
not sure to be honest i bought it as a gift but i know the person using it every single day since christmas time and they in love with it . really recommended 
it is a shipping display box 
this vacuum does well on any type of carpet or floor . i have both short and standard pile carpet in my home and it does great on both . excellent purchase 
i can vacuum my entire downstairs which takes about 30 minutes and i still have a good charge on it 
it is rechargeable non-replaceable . 
hey lori , this vacuum weights 7.5 pounds 
no , it 's not trash after a year . i think it is one of those lifelong type of batteries ( like 30-year last life ) . 
i think it does . 
i do not know , but we have had ours for several months and it recently stopped working . we will be sending it to a repair shop to fix . can not recommend this unit . 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the information available on a supplier website , there is no battery in this vacuum . i hope this helps ! 
they are made of a very heavy hard plastic . the ottoman is beautiful & very sturdy . it looks better than some of the more expensive ones listed . 
the inside has a black lining to it . there is wood on the inside but i am unsure as to whether or not it is cedar . i ca n't remember what it smelled like when i first got this . this is mostly assembled , you have to put the legs on , as an fyi they are made of a `` wood-grained '' durable plastic . dimensions are 50 '' x19.75 '' x16.5 '' with the legs on . this is actually a really nice bench and i 'm glad i bought it . 
2 or 3 , but it 's not that strong . we use it for storage and decoration . i would n't recommend it for permanent sitting on it . 
16.5 '' high with legs attached 
guest and my children sit on it all the time ! very sturdy ! 
it is made of faux leather , very soft to the touch . i love it , i use it often to sit on it with my laptop desk . very confy ! 
yes 
the dimension must be listed on the sale page ; it 's a great item ... 
nice apple red 
its about 10 inches deep . i have a ton of stuff in mine . 
in my opinion is it like a pearl white or a creamy white . for me it matched great with my white furniture . but it is not stark white . 
not really , only if you want the legs on . we opted to use it without the legs as it fit at the end of my daughter 's bed that way . if you want to add the legs , you just screw them in . the unit is fully assembled otherwise . good luck . 
yes 
i am not home - i will check when i return- it sits on the floor at the foot side of queen bed- it is just smaller than the width of the bed and at least 18 wide- it is quite large . 
this product also comes in red and black . 
17 '' with feet , 14 '' without . 
so worth it . looks very luxurious and quite funtional . i was very pleased with the product as well as the shipping . the finish is very good . if you need anything to be answered in particular , ask away.. 
yes . i have it at the end of my bed . and i always sit on it 
i think it 's about 12 to 15 lbs . it 's light , comfortable , sturdy and very pretty . 
my whole family has sat on them . 45-210lbs . 
no it does not fold it comes assembled which is nice . 
it 's dark brown . easy to paint if you do n't like it . 
i have not had any trouble so far . 
it looks like real leather 
yes it is - we have used it for exactly that . i would not recommend to have a 300 lb . person sit on it , but it certainly works fine for a `` normal '' size adult . 
not sure , very high quality and very pleased with them . 
i would call it `` cream '' 
the ottoman is 8lbs 
7 inches on the top , 5 inches on the bottom and 5 inches tall 
yes , it works well 
probably not , it barely fits in the grand pappy with the handle bent straight up . 
it does not do a very good job of grinding large , hard spices such as nutmeg . you would need to break up the nut somewhat to get a fine grind of nutmeg . nothing works as well as a microplane for nutmeg . 
yes i use it for flaxseeds and chia seeds . 
you must apply pressure downwards from the top of the unit for the grinder to work . 
we tried it and it does grind almond . we like this machine , it is durable and easy to use . nahla 
i mainly use the grinder for whole coffee beans . i have not experienced anything `` leaking '' from the bowl . what i have noticed is that the coffee grounds ( which are barely an iota of an amount ) will sift from the top of the cover upon removing it . this is so negligible as to not be a problem with me at all . i actually love the grinder . i do n't know how they seal it , but i 've never found any `` leakage '' inside the unit ( or even underneath the bowl around the shaft ) after removing the bowl . i had a much fancier grinder for about 15 years until it finally went the way of most things electrical . i researched coffee grinders for months until i settled on the secura electric coffee and spice grinder . my only wish is that this was made in the united states instead of china . i read so many fine things about the secura i decided to put aside my concerns for its being made in china . you see , i like to support the us when i can . it is hoped this answers your question . 
not that i have found . the longer you grind the finer the coffee . i pulse my grinder to get the grind i prefer . i have made castor sugar in the grinder ( it is almost as fine as powdered sugar ) and it worked great . i really do love it , it works great on everything i have tried . 
the max capacity of each cup is one cup . thank you . 
it depends on how fine you want to grind it . the dual blade coarse grinds and i mostly use it for coffee and nuts . i use the four blades for spices when i want something finely ground . i hope this helps . 
it 's the best grinder i have ever owned . i never used it for rice but have ground allspice which is quite hard . one key thing to note is that you need to pulse with it instead of steady grind .

the cup holder lights have an on off button , but the buttons themselves light up . they stay lit as long as the couch is plugged in . they are n't very bright though , if that 's your concern . let me know if you have any other questions . my fiance and i bought this couch , and are very satisfied with it so far . it 's a very space-age sofa with all the bells and whistles . ; ) 
the footrest reclines to horizontal . the backrest reclines to a little past 45 degrees . not quite flat but still good for resting . 
overall width is 85 '' for the three seat version . 
literally the best furniture purchase ive made in a long time . i l o v e this seat . it has been very durable , easy to clean and is simply beyond cool . i use it in my office mancave and the entire family loves it . i thought i would not like the bonded leather but took a chance . i have no issue with it now at all . my advice is that if you are on the fence ... buy . youll find nothing better in this price range and quite honestly higher . 
chair comes in sections . main section is very heavy . i have an 36 `` door , but the sections should go through a 30 '' door . 
i do n't know of any tutorials on this . look for a small power cord on the back of the couch at the bottom near the floor . it is between the left hand side recliner and center seat . the plug on it will only fit the transformer plug , so you ca n't mistake it . 
the controls for the seat and headrest are built into the cupholder . 
both names have been used for this style from seatcraft . the model number is 363 . 
like , a single reclining chair ? i have n't seen one , but i know there is a matching love seat , but it 's about the same price . so you might as well get the full sofa . 
no the center seat does not recline . it only folds down to reveal a burlwood cupholder , powerbar with two usb ports and two 120v power outlet and two led reading lights

i measure 18.5 inches 
place in holes then push down 
the coloration particularly considering the texture is more ivory white . 
only if it came from a vinyl cow ... ... . 
yes ! we have ordered then for everyone in our office now ... because they were so comfy ! we are graphic designers so we sit in front of the computer most of the day and the chairs are great ! 
it does off some lumbar support and it is a comfortable chair to sit in , but the lumbar support is not adjustable . 
i use the clorox wipes to wipe down the chair 
no 
no 
i have only had it a short time . my kids get dirty pencil fingerprints on it , and i just use a little laundry soap and it comes right off . it is super well made like everyone says 
at the base it is 6 inches across then it widens to 7 inches and widens again to 8 inches at the top . it 's about 4 inches deep . i use it almost daily . it 's the best steamer i 've ever owned . 
made by meyer corporation . i have bought circulon for over ten years . 
yes , because of the taper it will work with most other companies sauce pans . 
that depends on a couple of things ... how much each member will eat and the type of vegetable you are steaming . having said that , the steamer will hold an ample amount . we like to steam broccoli , green beans , cauliflower , potatoes , peas and the like . some obviously take up more room than others . but we always seem to have enough for our meals . hope this helps . by the way , it 's great for eggs . i steam mine rather than boil them . i do a dozen at a time - takes about 17 - 18 minutes depending on how hard you like them . 
absolutely ! a large cauliflower may be tight , but if you cut in appropriate size pieces you can get it all in . 
dear ling , thank you for your inquiry . we do n't recommend to stack the steamers . this items is designed for use with 2-quart , 3-quart , and 4-quart capacities . the dimensions are as follows : the width is approximately 8 inches and the depth is approximately 7 inches . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . sincerely , tonia d . 
it is n't stamped `` stainless steel '' , but it definitely is . i have occasionally forgotten for several hours to empty the water from the pot below , and the residual moisture would have long ago started to rust regular steel . 
yes . it will steam fresh or frozen vegetables . 
it 's very versatile pan size-wise with the smallest size pan it can accommodate gradually increasing by what appears to be an inch each time , so the it should work with 6 '' , 7 '' and 8 '' diameter pan . it 's an excellent steamer which we use frequently . it does not fit a 4.5 quart saucepan , at least not mine , however a 3.5 should be fine ! 
i do n't have circulon pots but it fits cuisinart and a couple of other brands in my collection . the tapered construction pretty much guarantees it will fit just about anything of a normal diameter . 
4 '' in height for the small drawer , 6 1 2 '' for the larger drawers . 13 '' front to back and 24 '' in width . 
it 's the length of the height of the chest of drawers , but it weights a lot ! ! 
typical backing , not wood or cardboard but that in between stuff . 
hi ! i do n't recommend you to buy this ... it looks nice but the material from which is made is n't good . it has this smell which doesnt want to go away . u can not keep there clothes because they get this chemical smell . i think about throw it away ... however , i would recommend you to buy this : sauder shoal creek 4-drawer chest in oiled oak . it not only look nice but it doesnt smell . 
metal . i put this together myself pretty easily . time consuming , but the directions are great . 
i 'm sorry we do n't ship overseas . you may check with other amazon distributors . 
assembly takes some time - about 2 hours - but is not complicated . directions are clear and straightforward . 
it is very costly to ship to hawaii . i 'm sorry but we do not ship to hi . you may see if a retailer could order for you . 
it depends on the `` store '' you buy it from . from bestfurniturebuys , we ship in 2-3 working days and it would take 1-4 days to receive depending on what state you live in . 
the outside dimensions are 31 '' wide , 17 5 8 '' deep and 49 3 4 '' tall . 
pressed particle board but they are very sturdy and fairly eazy ensemble 
the color is as pictured.. i love mine ! 
the color is called `` warm '' gray , an technically it 's a brown gray . hope that helps . 
this piece of furniture took me many hours to assemble ( about 7-8 hours over two days ) and you will need at least one other person to help you , as some pieces are very heavy and it 's difficult to fit the pieces together without another set of hands . beautiful end result though and pretty sturdy for pressed wood ! 
every vendor on amazon may have a different way to ship , either via semi truck , ups , fedex ground , etc . usually a semi truck delivery is curbside but ups or fedex should take the package to your door . 
i do n't know what exact size of box was but it was very large and very heavy . my husband had a hard time getting it up the stairs . 
yes they are two separate drawers . so all together the dresser has 4 drawers and 2 cabinets 
the middle drawer areas are fairly wide ; however , there is not a brace in the middle of the two drawers so you could only remove the bottom drawer . 
the dresser is very sturdy and can hold a television . keep in mind you have to build it yourself so how sturdy it comes out also depends on you . 
no shelves but space is big enough for a basket or shelving baskets -- -for cubicle type bookcases organizers . 
the height is only good for shirts and pants . 
yes it definitely wood . it is set up for either an clothing armoire our for a tv . 
yes , you can use it for clothing , it comes with a garment rod . there are no shelves that come with the armoire . 
this is a flat pack however it was fairly easy to assemble . it took me a little over an hour to assemble 
from the top of the molding to the armoire `` feet '' , it is 71 inches tall 
no it is not made of solid wood . it is made of a pressed fiberboard with a laminated finish . very nice looking . 
no 
yes . and it is a great unit . 
yes 
it will accommodate up to a 32 '' tv weighing 50lbs or less . 
20 '' x 16.5 x 8.5 '' 
yes - the light coming off the machine is pretty bright . the dehumidifier is a great machine though & works amazingly well . we love it but we use ours downstairs in the basement where the light does n't pose a problem . hope this helps . 
it is located in the bottom back of the unit . 
it is warm air . 
its an odd size , not a garden hose . i found hose close enough and put a clamp on it to hold it in place . works fine , better than trying to empty the bucket . 
the fan stays on all the time . 
a uv light is incorporated into the unit and it is selectable on or off in the control panel menu . 
it is not very noisy . i have owned several dehumidifiers and it is the quietest one i have had 
sorry , i do n't know . i bought this dehumidifier for the basement of my house in toronto . i have not used it until this month . i 'll check it out and let you know if there are differences . 
16.14x8.27x21.46 inches or 41x21x54,5 cm weight27.6 pounds 
the lid is attached , it does not come off as part of the design . however if you want to cut the plastic to remove the lids , that is certainly something you could do . the organizing place 
yes . the organizing place 
yes you do . each drawer a separate case , hinged at the back . 
i do n't know if you can purchase just the chest or not , but i do know that all the iris cases do not fit the chest . i 've only ever seen them offered as a set . 
14 x 14 
you will have lots of room ... ... each case measures approx . 14.4 '' l x 14.1 '' w x 3.1 '' h 
each case measures approx . 14.4 '' l x 14.1 '' w x 3.1 '' h 
yes , it has english voice commands . great machine 
yes it can make beef stew and chicken soup with the multi cook function . 
you can cook soup and rice and porridge . 
all electronic come with one year manufacturer warranty . thank you 
yes . it works in usa . 
yes , the buttons are labeled in both english and korean 
no it does not . but you can remove the inside lid for cleaning purpose . 
according to the manufacturer 's website , this model has dual voltage capability 
no . but they have slow cook mode . i dont know what will you cook . they have a lot of mode . 
hi it is for north america that mean is 115v only . i dont know about in canada but might be same volt . 
nope . but anything above that . 
yes , it is . from peets.com and able brewing company both . the gold version is $ 125 . http : ablebrewing.com collections products # kone-coffee-filter 
yes , it sits up a bit , but i use it every day ! 
per able brewing website the brewing system is made in usa . i purchased the kone coffee filter . great filter - `` is a stainless steel reusable filter which allows for more oils and a fuller bodied cup of coffee than paper . designed to create the best coffee possible for those seeking a sustainable alternative to paper filters . features : fits kone brewing system fits standard 6,8 and 10 cup chemex coffee makers stainless steel photo etched filter media food safe plastic structure support ring flat cone tip for safety 100 % made in usa by able brewing '' 
no , it is a metal seam . 
could n't find an answer on the net , sent able an inquiry - if they respond with the answer i will post it . 
the 3 cup version 's cone is smaller and narrower then the standard chemex 
no 
i have no idea what that is . it 's a similar in size to a number four cone coffee filter . it 's not the same size but if you have one of those in your house it 's a decent comparison . 
5 1 8 inch outer edge to outer edge of the black plastic rim 
i 've had that happen also . sometimes the grind of the coffee is n't fine enough . sometimes i do n't have the filter holder screwed in tight enough . i also make sure the printed side of the filter is facing up as per the directions . sometimes the evil morning coffee gnome is at work ! ! ! good luck ! 
lettering upwards , towards the coffee grounds . the holes are manufactured slightly conical in the vertical dimension and will be more easily clogged if the wide dimension faces the coffee . 
mine does n't but if it 's not deep through the holes it may not matter ? might just ask for a replacement from amazon customer service to be safe , do n't want any other particles coming off of it ... 
it is entirely stainless steel made of one single sheet standard size for the aerobie top . holes are superfine it works great 
diameter is 2.5 inches 
2 & 7 16 '' or 6.4cm , or 64mm 
2 and 7 16 '' sounds right to me . i just checked a couple of other sites and they had the same price as amazon for this particular filter disk , or slightly higher . checked the able brewing web site , and $ 12.50 is also the msrp . and for whatever it 's worth , my experience with amazon 's customer service has been pretty good nearly every time i 've had to contact them . had a few less-than-satisfactory exchanges , but nothing i 'd describe as `` trash . '' 
it should n't , it 's hold by the cap where you usually use the paper filters . 
product dimensions : 15.4 x 6.6 x 13.9 inches 
it will hold diapers , of course , but to hold a day 's worth , you 'll need to buy a large size trash can . i 'd recommend purchasing a container made just for diapers and it also has odor control . 
mine is in the bathroom for over a year and no rust so far . the inside is lined in black plastic . i was worried the chrome would rust but so far the product has withstood bathroom weather so well it looks new . 
you could fit a brown paper bag into that but the problem is that you wo n't get that nice seal when the lid closes . i 've used those plastic garbage bags and they 're ok . 
the lid is held onto the lift mechanism by two phillips-head screws . they can be removed . the lift mechanism sticks out in the back about 2-1 4 '' . it is held on by similar screws and could also be removed . ( i do n't know what would be the consequences for the foot-pedal in the front . ) but why pay for all this engineering that you are n't going to use ? 
you can push the lid all the way back and it will stay open . 
this can is about 13 inches height , 11.5 inches depth and 6 inches width . 
6.6 inches wide ... 15.4 inches long deep ... 13.9 inches tall when lid is closed ... 25.4 when the lid is opened 
i will say that if you have a smart cat or dog that really wants to get into the trash can , they will get into it . you can very easily lift the lid up without the pedal , and i would think that a dog or cat could easily push the lid up with their nose . 
i do n't use it for compost . i use it as a wastebasket in the bathroom . the bag liners i use are the plastic bags you get at the grocery store . not sure what size that is ? ! ? 
no . hand wash only . ours cracked after a few months . : ( 
yes ... the glass drinking jars use standard lids . be careful of the plastic glasses ... the lids are not standard . 
i pretty sure you can since it is class 
it 's glass and very nice except that the metal handle is attached with some sort of adhesive and according to the label ca n't be machine washed . they are glass with metal handles . nice , except they ca n't be machine washed . 
sorry i do n't remember , but i bought a lid in wegmans that has a spout for sipping and one for a straw , i love this mug 
usa 
yes 
i did hot tea once ... be careful ... the metal handle gets crazy hot ! ! ! 
no 
it 's included in the item description on the listing : 6.2 x 5.5 x 7.1 inches ; 1.4 pounds 
the letters are plastic . 
2 weeks 
no there was no recipe . let me know if you need anything else . 
yes , they are made of plastic . i have n't tried them out yet , but they seem solid ! 
yes , the letters are 0.6 cm high . 
the pieces include duplicates of letters , individual numbers , and there are almost all punctuation symbols , including - , + , . , & , ! etc . 
about 3 inches 
yes , just spoke to customer service and they will send you one call 1-800-672-6333 mr. coffee parts 
this unit is 110v . 
yes , it 's made in china , what is n't ? glad i bought it before i asked . does lead poisoning drive one `` mad '' ? check back , later . 
it is pretty quiet , much quieter than my last one was . 
i put the cocoa in with the milk and use the frothing disk all the time . never had an issue . 
no , the bvmc-hc5 is designed for making hot cocoa . 
i do n't think you can ... it is just for hot chocolate . 
just cocoa and other drinks from mixes , like chai 
yes , i always use it with milk.. regular milk works best . i have used almond milk also but it does n't turn out as well . 
for parts and products please contact us at mrcoffee.com contactus for more assistance . 
i touchless web site . contact number 800-660-7978 
you can find replacement parts on the itouchless website . 
i do n't see one on the pack i have . it 's basically a fibercloth bag filled with charcoal . as long as you store your stockpile in an airtight container before use , it should last . 
naturally , it depends on what you put into the trash receptacle as to how bad the odor is or how bad it will get . we replace our filters about every 3 months and get along real well the odor control . 
thanks for posting your question , unfortunately this item can not be shipped to india . an easy way to check if the item can be shipped to your location would be to add it to your cart and then click the `` proceed to checkout '' button . an error message will appear if it is not able to be delivered to your destination . if you are able to proceed through the order process you will be shown shipping methods speed prices to chose from . i hope this was helpful 
i would say soft . 
hello kris , a steel base , a standard foundation ( not box springs with coils ) and or a platform bed are all ideal bases to go under the memory foam mattress . the harder the surface , the better the memory foam mattress will perform . in short a box spring is not required . just a firm surface to go under the mattress ! hope this helps , steve 
it 's a very comfortable bed i love it . all my friends say something about how nice it is and foam is somewhat dense but it is a soft bed . and holds like 325 at least for my husband and i weight combined . i am very happy with this bed .

hello lexine , no . a steel base , a standard foundation ( not box springs with coils ) and or a platform bed are all ideal bases to go under the memory foam mattress . the harder the surface , the better the memory foam mattress will perform . 
we used the meatleslat platform for our box spring because ourkid is heavy 
i did n't measure it when i got it , but i 'd say approximately 65 inches tall and about 12 inches across . 
the mattress is compressed and rolled at the factory so that it can be packed in a box . this allows us to ship the mattress via fedex and it and it also makes it much easier for customers to unpack and move the mattress to their room of choice . 
customers are responsible for the returns shipping cost . 
8 '' 
no . 
it does not come with pillows 
all mattress sizes are standard dimensions : twin = 39 '' w x 75 '' l , twin-xl = 39 '' w x 80 '' l , full = 54 '' w x 75 '' l , & queen = 60 '' w x 80 '' l . 
we have 2 of these mattresses . and no they do not have cooling effect . but we do have one that does . search amazon for cool memory foam mattress . 
no it does not - back rest folds down to create the bed . 
no not even close . i do n't recommend this very poor quality . 
it does not have pockets on the sides . it seems to be a nice sofa , but very uncomfortable . 
not sure what it 's made of but it 's very comfortable and firm and looks great in my summer home . 
i use the hydro flask flip lid . works perfectly . 
yes you can 
yes . i have two 64 oz and a 32 oz stainless all the lids are a plastic with a thick rubber connector . none have kneaded a drop . i also have the optional pop up or sipper lids ... they are also sturdy . 
i know that the hydro flask lid fits that bottle . the kleen kanteen bottle i have has internal threads . if you intend to carry it by the loop , beware that when full it is very heavy . 
ive never bought the hydro flask , but in looking at it , i would have to say that this product is way bigger in that it olds 64 oz . instead of the 40 ... also it is double walled and stainless both in and out , we are very very happy with it and highly recommend : ) ) ) ) ) 
i would n't think so . the paint would probably knock right off . still worth the price and less expensive ( for now ) while everyone else buys the `` other guys '' brand . an independent salesman at a popular big box retail store told me they are in fact made in the same plant as the `` other guys '' brand . 
not sure there really is one . i have had mine for a few months now . i bought the 40 and 64 oz . i will be honest the finish could be a little tougher , but its ability to keep drinks cold or hot for an extended period of time is great . well worth the money . i will buy them again when i need to . 
it 's started to on the bottom . 
i know most of the wide mouth tops will fit it . i 've got a humangear on mine . 
from my understanding the husband and wife duo who started hydroflask got divorced and one of them launched this product , if you look up the materials it is exactly the same 
the pots do not have any type of teflon on the inside cooking surface . the pots pans are made of a rock particle making them unique in the kitchen cookware products . 
yes 
yes - as well as on non-induction cooktop . i purchased this set to replace some of my older cookware and to use with my induction burners . 
according to the stonelineshop website , they are different brands 
no you can not it is open 
we do not recommend washing in the dishwasher , as you should simply wipe out the pan with warm water and paper towel . you can use soap and water also to clean the pan , but no scrubber or sponge with abrasive surface . 
hello thanks for your inquiry ! all of our stoneline cookware can be used on induction stoves . hope this help ! 
yes the pans can be used on induction stoves . 
the cookware is made from stainless steel , aluminum , glass , and a 4.5 millimeter magnetized stainless steel plate base to ensure even heat distribution with no hotspots on the cooking surface . the inside is made up of stone . 
yes the cookware can be used on induction stovetops . 
manufacturer recommends hand washing . 
we offer several sales a year . please check back in a few weeks for our valentines president 's day offers . 
works great . do n't turn up too high . no need to . 
no not china . i believe they are made in germany . 
i have an entire set and find no restrictions with my use . 
no must use nonmetal 
no . but best pots in the world in my opinion 
hello . none of our items are coated in teflon . the inside are coated in stone , creating the unique non stick . 
it is a lightweight stool , not meant for sitting , but i 've gotten away with sitting on it for storytime to my kids each night . so far , months later , it 's still good . 
yes they screw on . 
yes and it is nice . i want to get another one but the colors are limited . i want brown . i have white and red . 
the legs are black . 
yes , the 9.5 inches includes the height of the feet . ray 
9 1 2 inches 
hi , thanks for posting . i 've searched our catalog and it appears that the only color available in this particular style of footrest stool is white . however , you may be interested in a different style footrest stool by the same manufacturer . you can have a look at them here : 
no there are no ties , however , i have not had a problem with the insert shifting . i have two of these covers , one in blue and one in cream and love them . 
no , but i have n't had a problem with it shifting . if i do , i will use safety pins to secure the corners . i 've done that before . i enjoy this set more than any i 've ever used . 
it 's like silk . cool in summer . just little too slippery . hard to keep it in place . 
yes , it is currently covering my down comforter now . has button closures . 
queen is 90 '' x 92 '' king now says it is 106 '' x 92 '' ( i believe it used to be `` 120 '' x 92 '' ) 
these bamboo are 300tc . because bamboo fibers are short , we are unable to make a higher counts , if we do , sheets will pill a lot ! 
these duvet covers do n't have ties . we carry same exact size insert comforter , to ensure it does n't move inside . 
we have a 10 '' thick mattress and they fit perfectly , i would n't use them for anything bigger . 
i never even bothered to look it up . probably not the usa . this is a repurchase because they are so great ! the other set lasted two years . 
these bamboo sheets are 300 tc . however , bamboo fabric are naturally soft , and making these with higher thread count than 300tc will cause the sheets to pill . 
i bought these , do n't bother , they are terrible and most bamboo sheets , towels are great but these were not . they looked great out of the package but once they were washed and dried , they were awful . 
the description box reads 15-7 8 '' x 7-3 8 '' x 4-3 4 '' 
yes , with inches to spare on both sides . 
it possibly could but this is more so better for makeup 
one might be able to put a curling iron straightener in the center section , standing up . a lot depends on just how much and what kind of `` hair stuff '' you are referring to . in my opinion it is better suited for makeup accessories and as i mentioned a few hair items , depending on the size and quantity . 
i think it is real wood . it 's too light to be mdf . 
yes , they are . they wo n't sit too deep in them , but it will definitely hold them . it hold my eyeliner pencils great 
yes , the back is made from the same material as the rest of the organizer . it should hold with small or medium screws . 
i really do n't know . 
i 'm sorry i ca n't as i gave it as a gift to my granddaughter who lives out of town - the next time i talk to her ( couple of days ) i will ask her - sorry 
according to one reviewer , the drawers are 2 '' tall , 3.25 '' deep , and 4.1875 '' [ ~4.25 '' ] wide . 
i have used my soup dishes many times , as well as flat plates and salad plates , in the microwave and have had no cracking or breakage . 
i would say around 60 lbs . i 'm a small stature person and had a hard time carrying into my house . 
it 's off white -- almost a bone color . 
ceramic 
its says 25 pounds at the description.. but the true is 54 pounds ! ! ! ! ! 
when we placed our set next to a white serving dish , our set looked off white almost egg shell in color . not bright white . hope this helps ! 
it 's probably on the heavier side . 
no 
nope ! not at all 
while any dish ware not metal nor plastic can break and not totally indestructible , this ironware is the least likely and extremely durable , considering . also most high end looking set for what it is ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . 
i did n't get the cross pillow but it looks good without it . i added sum turquoise pillows to bring more western color to it 
the neck roll comes in the bag and the fringe pillow is out of stock 
yes there are dark or tan available . 
it can but i think it is out of stock 
no 
hi chef wannabe , this is the only steam convection toaster oven available from cuisinart at this time . 
no , but they slide in and out easily . i just let them cool off , or if i have to take them out when they 're hot , i use oven mitts . this is not exactly on point , but i love the machine . the steam-broiled chicken is delicious , and i 've made salmon as good or better than i do on the grill 
i 'm sorry but i checked tell instruction manual and there is nothing about the beeping . mine is loud enough to hear even in the next room with noises in the background . 
this is a wonderful toy . i use it practically every day from toast in the morning to baking real potatoes , with steam , in the evening . also broils with without steam and bakes with convection . the steam-only setting heats at 100 degrees ; almost a sous vide , at a fraction of the price . 
yes it will work very well ! 
i steam vegetables , fish , farro , rice ... anything that taste best steam ... i also reheat leftovers with steam , so they do not get dried up . 
it does not get that hot on the outside . 
convection bake , bake steam and bread settings have a max temp of 450 degrees . broil and broil steam settings have a max temp of 500 degrees . these specs are based on the user manual and i have not conducted my own tests to verify the accuracy . 
even if u could not worth it 
3 years 
yes it is . i always dry it off well and is does great 
it has n't heated up easily as far as i can tell . i do n't use it for things that would require more than a couple of minutes of blending , and most things not more than about 30 seconds of blending . i am well satisfied with it . 
hi , just measured it , it 's 2,5 inc. have the best of days 
it looks like the part on the attachment is metal but the part it fits into is a hard white probably plastic . it has a lot of power and so far i have been really satifsied . 
probably not . it is not the intended use . the blender is for soft fruits and veggies . 
yes 
absolutely . i chopped a few cups of pecans in it for my cooking class . it is very powerful . i wish i had bought this one for myself instead of the cuisinart . 
i think the best way to figure out the size of the mixing bowl is to look at the whisk . this is a hand mixer , so it will do a couple of ordinary sized carrots , or a couple handfuls of nuts . i think it chops evenly enough , but do n't overload the little bowl . 
the blades are metal and the motor , etc are encased in plastic , but they feel heavy and sturdy . 
no , it 's not wireless . 
that 's what i would call it . it is not shiny 
yes . 
the lid is one piece . 
i would imagine that you could put them in the dishwasher . however , to preserve the finish , i would just hand-wash them . the finish is rather thin , and scratches easily - so , it would not take long for the dishwasher to remove the finish . they are worth the money ! you will love them . 
12 oz 
they fit perfectly on a narrow mouth canning jar . i tried it on two different canning jars - one was ball canning jar - and the other was an off brand . 
i 've used flexible straws from walmart and ikea . they 're striped and colorful . i think the flexible ( bendable ) look cuter than straight straws . 
the lids are made of metal that fit glass mason jars . check the size of the `` mouth '' of your jar to make sure it 's the right size for the lid . 
these particular lids are for standard mouth jars . 
regular 
no , it wo n't have the space . the spot that you would do you work will be the spot the key board will be . i suggest a wireless keyboard . then you might have the space you want . 
the dimensions of this desk is 40.25 x 19.5 x 33.25 '' h 
i measured it quickly using an ikea measuring tape so it may not be super precise : desk 40x33.5x19.5 '' shelves 10x15.5x11 '' drawer 10x2.5x13 '' 
absolutely there is a nice amount of space on the desk top

if you go here and they require the upc code of the product , your email and phone number they will send it to you . http : www.sauder.com customerservice instruction-book-request.aspx 
thank you for your inquiry . it should work just fine . hope this helps ! ! 
yeah it would 
no . it has a regular small drawer to the right , and under that one shelve that can be move up or down accordingly . 
it is 16.5 '' x12.5 '' 
it can hold a plate with up to 11 '' to 12 '' diameter securely . 
13 '' wide , 15 1 1 '' long and 1 1 `` thick , when folded

19 inches . 
hi ellen , sorry we do n't have locking wheels . 
yes -- easy 
from the floor to the top of the seat is around 23 inches . 
plastic 
it appears to be non-stick ; once you follow the instructions and use a coating of oil ... ... ... .i have been wondering since it arrived , after washing it several times , removal of some grit is not difficult ... ... so ... ... ... ... ... it appears to be non stick ... ... ... ... .with experience , after a while , sometimes the `` so called '' non stick coating is removed ... ... do n't know the name of the non stick coating . removed ... ..the name of the non stick material i do n't known . 
for as expensive as it was , i thought it was junk . everything stuck to the non stick grill 
no . 120w 
anywhere that has a plug i 'd say ! i use mine inside only and then i have a charcoal grill for outside : ) 
china 
i was a product tester so i 'm not sure 
yes but you never know what the true temp is no display just a knob no digital read out to be safe buy a forman grill 
this humidifier uses a wick so i would think not 
no . it only does it if you 're blasting the a c to the max for a while , then it might fog up a bit . but it 's not really all that powerful . it 's still pretty effective as a humidifier , just not as effective as a full sized one by any means . 
the product comes with 2 little filters ( they are small things ) . when i received the product , there was a coupon good for some free replacement filters , so i immediately did that . i have not had to replaced the filter yet and have used the product for 6 plus months . when you need the filter you will have to get them directly from the company , as i ca n't imagine anyone else even carries them . 
not really sure . i usually use the intermittant setting . i drive about 40 minutes each way to work 5 days a week , and it lasts a month or so that way . 
it 's totally quiet ! ! i highly recommend ! 
cool must only 
it plugs into the car cigarette lighter and provides a mist that is continuous . do n't think ultrasonic , but the mist is quite fine . it can plug into an outlit that fits usb . i like it . 
yes 
hi theresa , the direction comes with it ... if yours does not have it for whatever reason , please email info @ canaryproducts.com , and they will email you one right away . best wishes , 
yes it can be attached to the car 's air vent . 
not at all ! i have used it 4 times and still does n't need to be cleaned . naturally this will depend on the size of your home and length of use ( per hour ) . 
yeah its got the little twist thing at the handle i think , but thats the only way . it may still be too much suction , its got lots of power ! 
good morning . the vacuum most likely wont fit in a suitcase . unless the suitcase is very large . its about 37 inches around and about 17 inches long . hope this helps . 
yes it is flexable and moves easy 
no , no beater brush . i do not reccomend this vaccum cleaner as the components are very cheap and it does not perform well at all . 
as i understand you can wash and dry the ones that came with it , chris 
hi , yes it has a two seperate pieces . one is a small brush the other is for small spaces . 
less than 10lbs , not heavy at all ! 
no one has them . i am washing it but it already could use a replacement . while i like the vacuum , i would never buy it again because without replacement filter it is a junk . 
it can be used for any surfaces . i have a child too who make mess everywhere . i love this vacuum , just buy it you wo n't regret it . 
i have owned both and truly believe the bosch is superior ! the bosch can do anything a ka can do and then some . i believe it can whip as little as one egg white but i 've never attempted that since i never need only one . your whipped cream and frosting are light and fluffy in no time . you can use the cookie paddles to mash refried beans or shred cooked chicken breasts . i believe the only down side is they are n't as pretty as ka on your counter top but i got over that years ago . good luck ! 
this is the exact same machine , except this bundle includes the cookie paddles . 
yes , this does come with the manufacturer warranty . it is a 3 year warranty on motor and transmission . 1 year warranty on parts and plastics . 
buy a new one 
the bosch is capable of handling it , with a 800 horsepower motor and die cast metal dough hooks it will work just fine . i 've mixed batches that used 9 cups of flours and not had a single blip . 
absolutely not ! it is not a flimsy plastic . i was just telling someone the other day that this is such a wonderful appliance ! ! ! so glad we got it ! ! ! i make tons of sourdough bread for friends . i have used the same starter for about 25 years ! until a years or so ago , i was doing all the mixing by hand ! this mixer is pretty awesome and i highly recommend it ! it is heavy duty without the `` heaviness ' of an industrial appliance . i use it almost every week and have had zero problems ! 
i believe it 's made in the us , but i 'm not really sure . do a google search on the company and perhaps you can locate it . 
110 i think . 
i 've added as much as 16 cups of flour in the bosch and it handled it extremely well . 
yes 
i purchased these for my daughter 's tea party this past april . i would say in can hold 18 - 24 depending on how they are arranged . very sturdy ! 
it is like cheap , brittle plastic . it looks nice when you take it out of the box ( if plastic is what you were hoping for ) but scratches quickly and turns dull . and yes i did only hand wash it with soap and water , no dishwasher used 
12 1 2 '' tall when fully assembled . 
good old really strong and nice looking bpa free , fda approved , food safe , dishwasher safe plastic . these are very nice ! 
it is flat but i am not so sure you could stand a cake topper on it alone . maybe if you put some fondant or some icing on the bottom to help it stick ? there is a part where it screws together to the post below that makes the surface slightly unlevel . when covered with food you can not see it . 
yes 
yes , there 's nothing inherent about the plastic that would not allow it to be painted . i just ca n't speak to the prep that would be required so that the paint would stick the best . 
there is a hole where you put the risers , if you use a doily you can cover up the hole and use as separate dishes , you can separate into two layers if needed . 
the top tier is about 4 to 4.5 inches the middle tier is about 6 to 6.5 inches , and the bottom tier is about 8.5 to 9.5 inches . i hope this helps ! 
yes without the riser . 
i just grab an empty beer case box every now and then when i buy a six pack from the local liquor store . they know i homebrew and always have spare boxes around to give . 
the neck will fit in the holes but they are too wide to put one in each hole . the rack will hold 12 of the 22oz bottles . 
only if the flip top is removed . this could be done , but it be a time consuming task . i think that a bottle drying tree might be easier . 
yes . each rack holds 24 , 1 ounce bottles . 
they seem to be . i 've been using them for awhile now and have held up quite well and make my moscow mules quite tasty . 
probably just a very fine steel wool . 
india 
they are solid copper with a lacquer coating . 
no , it would take away the mugs character 
yes , as with all of them it will wear off quickly . aged copper mugs are the norm for me . 
yes , packaged well in plastic and foam . 
copper , through and through as far as i know . 
hi haddy , thank you for your question . yes , our android app is currently being developed and we anticipate it 's release sometime in the first quarter of 2014 . -vitagoods 
the specifications in the operation manual state that the weight measurement is from 11 to 441 pounds . 
i do n't know . i have an android phone . 
did not work for me either . would not paar . but the scale works well 
yes , the weights come into the app and you apply them to the proper user , then on futures weigh ins the scale associates the weight with the right user on its own 
no it is not . only with their own vitasigns application . but i hear health kit integration is coming in 2015 
not really . sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt . its a great scale overall though . 
hi , unfortunately this is not compatible with the fitbit system ; however , please note there is a manual upload for any entries you would like to add one at a time . 
hi , yes . please be sure to use the same log in information for all of the devices and be with in proximity of the scale to transfer information . sincerely , customer service 
hi simon , thank you for your question . unfortunately , at this time we do not have a pc version of our app but is something we hope to have in the future . our app is currently compatible with an iphone , ipad or ipod touch . i hope that helps answer your question ! 
this chair looks better than it sits . there is not much padding and if you lean forward it can be uncomfortable . i am 5'1 '' and when i sit all the way back in the chair my feet do n't reach the floor when it is set for the correct height to reach my computer table . when the chair is in it 's lowest position , my feet reach the floor , but i am sitting too low for the desk height . as i said , it is an attractive chair , but it is big and not super comfy in the seat . 
yes , it has hydraulic height adjustment . i love this chair . 
i suppose you could use it without the wheels just fine . legs are sturdy 
yes , it rotates 360 degrees . 
no . the back and the seat is one unit . however , the whole seating can be tilted forward . 
yes . my husband does hours and hours of work for his business . he sits in this chair the whole time , and said he is comfortable . now if he should do that is another matter ! 
i 'm sorry but since i do n't own the chair any longer i ca n't take that measurement for you . 
hello ! i used premium leather cleaner and conditioner . i have a lot of white furniture in my home and i use this for all of them . it works really well . hope this helped ! : ) 
no , i can only adjust the height of the chair , not the tilt . 
did n't weigh it , but definitely up near 40lbs ... 
you need to drill holes in the tile with a carbide-tipped masonary drill bit . i used a 6 mm bit ( slightly less than 1 4 inch ) . the holes need to be at least 1 inch deep , so they must go through the tile and into the wall behind it ; a total of 4 holes are required . plastic inserts are hammered into the holes , and the screw that are provided are screwed into the inserts to mount brackets to the wall . the screws cause the inserts to expand and wedge firmly into the wall . i suggest you first do some internet research on the best way to drill granite tile . a rotary hammer drill would be fast , but may risk cracking the tile . 
ours has n't stretched . is made of a nylon , possibly could stretch after heavy usage , but it has a screw that tightens down on the line after you pull it out , so you can adjust the length of line . 
i see no reason why it ca n't be used outdoors . however , be aware that it 's designed to hold only a few light items - i doubt the string would last long if , for example , you put large wet bath towels on it . also , the string might quickly deteriorate from outdoor exposure to uv light , and it 's not at all clear if it can be easily replaced . 
no 
the cord housing is about 3.75 inches in diameter . the small bracket that holds the end of the cord is about 2.5 inches by 1 inch . the cord was not measured . hope this helps ! 
i mounted this a while ago . my recollection is that it screws off or it easily pulls off . 
the plastic pieces should be installed between the metal parts and the wall , so that the metal edges do not cut into the surface of the wall . 
dear kim - this clothes line is very strong , i 've hung over 15 shirts along with 2-3 pair of pants on it at a time with no trouble ! mel 
it 's adjustable to shorter lengths . 
the line is very durable . we have hangers on it all the time -- very little sagging . 
hi , 50 red and 50 chocolate pics . the ribbon is also included . 
they are laser cut . 
hello ! the size is around in 5cm*5cm*5.3cm 
sorry , this order will be finished by amazon and they will ship one package in 100 pics . so the 50 pics are unavailable . 
hello ! the box has two color in a package , red and brown . 
mine have not ... but i wash them and dry them right away . love them though ... . 
i use them with the 12oz mason jars . but , these lids would fit any regular mouth jar ... just not the wide mouth jars . 
i just washed my by hand . they did n't come with any instructions so not sure . easy to wash by hand though 
you need the lid from the mason jar otherwise the 'hole 's in the lid are open 
i am not sure , i have the 16.5 oz mugs . they are so cute and i was able to put the decorative straws in the middle where the hole is . they are so cute , you may wish to try them , then if wo n't fit send them back . hope this helps & # 128515 ; 
paper straws at target fit this 
yes 
no actually it 's does n't fit . but paper straw will fit the slim one . 
yes , i bought it specifically for my moms house . she quit smoking in the house and cleaned everything but it still smelled . this kendal ozone ionizer worked great . the house has no smoke odor at all . 
i have about 2500 sq.ft . and all rooms are fresh .

how often do you have to replace the plates 
i believe it is made in china . although it is very hard to find an answer to this question . the address given is actually a warehouse , not manufacturing . address listed is : 1625 route 211 e. middletown , ny 10941. trademark is : listed for kendal is xiaomin chen of deheng chen , llc , 225 broadway suite 1910 , new york ny 10007 
the drawer can open either right side or left side depending on how you put it together . 
the dimensions are 11 3 4 '' w x 8 '' d x 23 '' h with 9 1 2 '' w x 7 '' d x 1 3 4 '' h drawer . 
only needs a half inch to slide under edge of couch . 
the sofa side table is 2 '' tall including the drawer . 
i 'd say no more than 35 to 45 lbs ! 
8 '' x 12 '' x 23 '' h 
i would say 175-200 lbs i 'm about 175 and it was fine . it might take more weight . great chair . 
i am 5ft 7 and i can get up just fine no problem . 
rubber wood is a strong type of wood ( that i understand to be pretty environmentally friendly ) . the white color is paint , i believe . not sure what you mean by what kind . i do n't know the exact seat arm rest measurements but they are probably available on their own website ... ? by the way , they did n't sell their own cushions when i received my chair , so i do n't know how theirs are ( the ones i purchased are ok , but probably not as perfect of a fit ) . i really like ours -- seems to be of really good quality . hope this helps some . 
no , it does not come with hooks or rings . this shower curtain is very thin . i decided to find better quality elsewhere . ross carries a better curtain for less money . 
can not discern thickness , but it is not enough to function well . ie , during cold winter in ne us , it blows into the warmth of the shower . the bottom magnets are not heavy enough to keep me from whacking it away in frustration . swearing loudly does not help restain the billowing . 
i did n't find any stars to select . so , i 'll tell you , i give 5 stars . i 'm sorry anyone claims the opposite of the description of this product , or the good reviews . some people do n't see quality because they do n't realize quality . you ca n't please everyone all the time ! the grommets are great ! the thickness is , in my opinion , perfect ! any thicker , it may be considered stiff . it is mildew resistant . i suppose you might be able to grow mildew on it , if you try hard enough . but , i doubt it . i 'm highly allergic to mold and mildew . the slightest bit of either sets me off . that 's why i bought this one . the only thing that might make it better is a few more magnets . it 's a great product and a great buy . period . 
hi amy , there are 12 grommet holes in this liner . it is a wonderful liner , i love mine . 
i did not purchase this for my home . i purchased it for our travel trailer . i am very pleased with it . i do n't anticipate to replace it often , since the trailer is used on a trip maybe once a month . 
hi sharon . no . i 've noticed the corners fold and stick to themselves but my curtain is just a little short in length and just makes it to the top of the tub so it does not stick . i hope this helps . 
it says in the product title `` heavy duty strength with extra bottom magnets ( 6 ) , '' and below that , it says `` accompanied with reinforced metal grommets & extra bottom magnets ( 6 magnets- double the average ! ) , '' and it says in the product description `` extra bottom magnets ( 6 ) . '' 
the curtain is 72 inches or 6 feet . only you can dictate how fair down into the tub it goes by deciding what height you put the curtain rod . the curtain rod should be approx . 76 inches from the bathroom floor . i like my liner . i hope this helps you . 
i did not notice a strong smell , but the vinyl is very stiff and does not slide or fold easily out of the way . it is a very large curtain , very bulky , but it is sturdy , will not tear easily . 
the shower curtain was made in china but distributed by a company in milwaukee . 
purchased last year . great . pain to clean but worth it 
yes , in fact i can never hear it . 
no . 
it has two plates that are easily removed and you clean with dish soap , water , and toothbrush , then set to dry , or blow dry if you 're in a hurry . the outside filters are so nice , these plates do n't get as dirty as my previous one that was $ 600 . 
not now . 
the crumb tray slides out the front of the oven . you need to open the door then pull out the tray 
just tried our 9 x 13 x 2 pyrex glass pan ; will not fit inside . 
yes - to four different levels . well , there are two slots in each side , but the tray itself has elevated & lowered levels . 
it beeps after the pre-heat and when finished or when you hit the start-stop button.the sound level is not too loud and when finished it beeps five times which is just enough too alert me when i am sitting in the other room watching television.sorry for the late response . 
we have had ours since december of 2013. thus far we are very happy with this item and have not seen the issue that you have inquired about . 
i got the answer directly from cuisinart this morning : yes , the non-stick interior does have a light grey ptfe pfoa non-stick coating called lexon . it looks like metal because of the color but is a non-stick coating . i was disappointed to hear this and will be returning my unit , which i bought based on the erroneous `` no teflon '' answers . 
ours has 1800 watts stamped on the underside of the unit . hope this helps . 
yes 
interior : 12 '' wide x 6 '' high x 11.5 '' deep exterior : 16.5 '' wide x 9 '' high x 12 '' deep exterior with spacers : 18 '' wide x 13.5 '' deep 
i 've been very pleased with both the speed and the evenness of toasting 
you want the dc `` inverter '' . this is what makes these little units more efficient . the inverter allows the ac to run at a range of speeds , and not just on and off like a regular ac system . it keeps room temperatures more comfortable while using less power . 
go to the highseer website . they have a pdf you can down load with all the facts . so far , the unit has been great . 
you need these two items . r134a will not work . http : www.amazon.com gp product b00159wz12 ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 http : www.amazon.com gp product b00d96ewkq ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 
if you go to highseer.com and this item you can find full specs . the heat is typically about 500 btu more than the cooling . but keep in mind that the amount of heat decreases as the outside temperature falls . so you might need fall back separate electric gas heat for some occasions . 
half ton ! 
with a new install you should pull the max . vacuum you can for at least 15 min . to dry the indoor unit and line set , then let it sit while checking your gauge set making sure there are no leaks half hour min . then follow instructions to release the gas from the outdoor unit again checking for leaks - i use a leak meter ( a $ 250.00 + tool ) . i hope this helps if not please post agian . ek . 
this although somewhat different then a residential `` split system '' still requires most of the tools and equipment required to install a split system . vacuum pump , gauges , flaring tool , some electrical stuff generally-just to mention a few . it is by no means a window unit that you just plug in and go . 
it came in three boxes . the condenser unit which was approx . 3 ' x 2.5 ' x 2 ' the blower for inside the home 4 ' x 2 ' x 2 ' and the coolant line set box . 2 ' x 2 ' x 4 '' 
i measured mine at approximately 52 db from 3 feet . keep in mind this is the outdoor unit . the indoor is much better , at 43 db full on . my neighbor 's new central air unit is much , much louder than this at 63 db 30 feet away . 
i just used mine tonight ! they are 2.25 '' across the bottom , 3.5 '' across the top , and 1.5 '' tall . i checked and they fit exactly inside my 6 hole jumbo muffin tin . 
most definitely , i have a gas oven and my breakfast muffins are wonderful and easy to clean after each use . i bought two sets , onw for myself and the other would be a great gift ! 
2.25 inches exterior . i love these cups . 
you do not . i have used them both ways . i just lined the cookie sheet with aluminum foil in the event it spills over . the muffins popped out really easy and held their form very well . clean up was a breeze ! i love these muffin cups ! ! 
yes they are 
the silicone material used to manufacture this product meets all the fda requirements specified by the u.s. code of federal regulations 21 cfr 177.2600. this regulation comprises a list of approved ingredients and additives along with prescribed test methods to evaluate candidate materials for definition as `` food grade '' rubber products by the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) . the prescribed method was used by an independent testing lab to test the material used in this product to ensure it is safe for repeated use in contact with food at higher baking temperatures . they are made from fda approved , bpa free , food-grade silicone . 
i do n't know , but my guess would be no . they might be too close to the elements . the package says safe in oven to 500 degrees f 260 c. contact pantry elements . 
no , its more like half size more 
not sure what you are using them for , but i tried to pour one cup of water into it , but it was just shy of fitting . 
i never have , but i would assume they would work fine because the silicone will grip to your cup . 
it should fit them both seeing as my cal-king pillow stop had room to spare . 
these come as 1 bag per-pretty much meant for the matress . if you 'd like to wrap the box springs as well , you 'll need to order additional bags for them . no tricky math ere , just order as many bags as you need . 
i only had my pillow top king mattress in the bag . i moved the 2 box springs separately , and unfortunately i do n't remember if there would have been room but i do n't honestly do n't think there would have been . my mattress was 22 '' . 
yes other reviewers are correct , there are small holes in this bag . i ca n't give an exact answer as i 'm not a medical professional but i would think it should give some protection . bed bugs have to be brought in from an outside source so if you are storing a mattress and do n't already have bed bugs you should be safe . if you do currently have bed bugs i would not trust this bag and i would consult an exterminator who knows what they 're doing . 
no handles 
these are giant plastic bags , without the locking seal . i suppose if you got creative you could roll it and , with help , tape it up while still keeping the air out , but there is nothing to seal on the bag . 
hi ! great question ! our eco mattress bags are sealed with any packing tape . it 's the only professional grade cover that 's made in america that is non crinkle and non crackle allowing for a tight firm fit when sealed with tape . if you email directly on the qty that you want to buy , we can review pricing and shipping rates with you ! were in business so you do n't have to stress about your mattress , because we 've got you covered ! ! ! 
i think it 's durable enough to protect the mattress well . just be careful when carrying as it may tear the cover . 
the one i purchased fit i dont remember the size . it did come in black , i wanted white . 
we make all of our bags with a 2.2 mil non vented ( which means no holes so it 's water , dust and debris proof ) recycled plastic with bio degradable and anti mold additives . to date , we are the thickest plastic mattress cover made in america and since we use a non slip process ( this is a very cool application ) , it allows the bag to easily slide on and pull tight without ripping . it 's non crinkling or crackling , so it 's ideal to seal and then dress the bed without effecting the feel when your sleeping . if you have any other questions , just let us know and we 're here to help you ! ! thanks ! spence 
yes . no problem . lots of good spices ! for the price you ca n't go wrong . 
yep , comes with a code inside the box for you to register for spices , but you do have to pay shipping .

they were plastic 
i would n't recommend it for that . containers are plastic and rack is smaller than it looks in photo . 
they are about half the size of the ones you see in the stores 
i 'm not sure but when k got mine it came with a slip that i had to sign up for and i get free refills for 5 years ! 
i 've had five and six year olds at it . it is great for outside picnics too . 
plastic 
it is 36 '' w x 28.4 '' d x 21.4 '' h . 
the table is too small for 6 children but 4 young children can sit comfortably . 
the utensils are twelve inches long . 
hello suzette , each spoon and spatula in the set is 12 inches long . thank you for your inquiry . 
no i do n't think so 
i 've had these spoons for a couple months now and use them everyday and put them in the dishwasher . i have yet to apply oil to them , and they are still in great shape . the color has n't faded whatsoever . eventually i 'm sure i 'll apply oil , but it has n't seemed necessary yet . 
dear mrs. diaz , our products premium bamboo are only sold on amazon.com . we are not selling in any store . what you saw in store is another product that was not manufactured by premium bamboo . one of our images on amazon has a picture of our spoons in a mesh bag with a green label . thank you ! sean premium bamboo 
i contacted the company and the response was all products are made in china 
rub some natural mineral oil on them every couple of months . do n't wash them in the dishwasher and do n't soak them in water . wash them in mild dish soap , rinse them , and let them air dry . 
32 oz size bottom = 5-1 2 '' across lip = 7-1 4 '' across bottom to top of usable space before lip riser = 2 '' bottom to top of bowl lip ( without lid ) = 2-3 16 '' bottom to top , closed with lip on and closed = 2-11 16 '' this by eyeball and metal ruler metal , so best effort accuracy these will nestle one on top of the other and not slide around - if you try and want more , do amazon search for nc-729 select seller webstaurant store and then view the alternate item that pops up , which i believe is this item in bulk pack . my wife and i love these ( we 're retired ) ! 
these are recyclable , microwavable and freezable type 5 polypropylene resin plastic . there is no bpa in polypropylene resin plastic regardless of the end manufacturer or product . so neither these reditainer products nor those of another manufacturer that uses the type 5 polypropylene resin plastic would contain bpa . 
i want to say they are usa but not 100 % sure . 
no 
i use mine over and over ... send food with the kids and they reuse it ... dishwasher safe..no problem with it ... i bought two sets 
for a short time , not for serious freezing , the seal is good but not airtight 
you can only use one pod at a time , but it does n't take long to brew . 
this tru single serve pod coffee maker takes the melitta ( senseo used to make them originally ) . the individual pods are round , about 2 3 4 inches from edge to edge . they are a soft paper filter material with coffee sealed inside . amazon sells the pods and by subscription is the best price i 've found . there are usually about 18 pods to a package . 
you can use any brand of pods . 
the reservoir holds about 5 cups . it is easy to refill or top up , and has a clear indicator for the water level . 
you can probably buy them right here on amazon - search for coffee pods i buy some from quill.com - donut shop coffee in both regular and decaf is delicious . 
yes , you can . i fill mine from the filtered water from my fridge . 
when you remove the bottom you could fit a 4-1 2 '' cup and that is the tallest . 
the booklet inside reads : `` one year limited warranty '' . 
the soft senseo pods are the best . 
adjust cup size and brew strength with the digital brew control and enjoy a fully customized cup of coffee in about a minute . 
yes the seat is attached , it 's one piece . the legs attach to the seat . 
very good size without cushions . as illustrated would make a tight fit with cushions 
in pieces . it took my dad about 45 minutes to put it together . no problems . i really like the chair . remember to get comfy cushions ! 
8 oz . perfect for a nice cup of tea : ) 
no , it does not ... i love these dishes ! ! 
i would use the word as off white and near to cream . but not very creamy in colour . 
the bowls are not very shallow - really nice in fact . however , the cups are really fragile - 2 were broken ( out of 8 ) when they were delivered , and i 've discovered 2 more are cracked - not sure if that was shipping or just regular use . 
yes 
they are a bit heavy but i enjoy using daily as they are so classy looking that i dont feel the difference . 
i do not know it does not say on the dishes . but what it does say is that it is oven , microwave , and dishwasher safe . i hope that helped you . merry christmas 
9 7 8 '' x 9 7 8 '' 
i do n't know measurements , patricia , but they are ample ... i already had little square bowls like this set.. a knock off of some sort , but they are too small for cereal , etc . the bowls that come with this set are perfect . i love this set ... they 're great ! dawn : - ) 
it 's made in china . for the price it looks great and upscale . it also holds up well in the dishwasher . 
it fits standard door measurement . mine is 1 3 8 . 
yes you can in the mesh area but i dont . there is also recessed areas above the mesh small items , like a shelf area . hope that helps . all my studs are my expensive pieces , that 's why i do n't use it for my studs . 
33 inches in height , 20 inches in width and 3-1 2 inches in depth . my daughter loves it ! ! 
15 3 4 inch center to center . fyi i love this organizer , do n't know what i did without it ! ! 
i hung mine on a flat wall and it works great ! ! ! 
it 's machine washable with special instructions tons on blanket or you can wash by hand 
62 '' x 50 '' 
mine plugs in on the colored side of the banket . there is a rectangle shaped outlet on the balnket . 
i just measured my mother 's which i bought her about 2 months ago . it measured at 48 '' by about 59 '' 
47 x 60 inches 
oddly this is not mentioned in the manual at all . call biddeford at 800-789-6441 and ask them . after all , virtually all electric blankets are under some bed spread or comforter , so i do n't see why not . best to ask them .

i emailed fletchers ' mill to ask the same thing before i bought it . here was their answer : our muddlers are untreated unfinished . you could season it with mineral oil from time to time if you want but we do n't do anything to it . it is raw maple that has been kiln dried to prevent cracking or warping . 
the bottom is flat , and it does a very good job 'mashing ' . 
absolutely . that 's the reason i purchased it 
maple 
the width is approx . 1 3 4 '' 
what do you mean by automatic pullout ? ? ? ? ? 
actually , because i am shopping for a new toaster oven and this one looks perfect for my family other than the non stick issue , i just contacted kitchen aid through their live chat . the non stick is teflon , and it does contain pfoa , but according to the service agent helping me and the scienctific community ( i did a little research ) the pfoa does not break down unless it is heated above 550-650 degrees f. hope this helps . 
it 's roughly 40 inches . 
all toaster ovens get hot on the outside . this one seems to be reasonable - just leave room around it for cooling . the top can be used to pre-warm dishes . 
no 
depth 16 , height 12 , width 18 '' . 
you can set this to any temp from 150 to 450 at 5 degree intervals . 
i have n't noticed that the handle gets hot at all , but the exterior does get pretty hot . the manufacturer suggests that you make sure that the sides , back and top are at least 4 inches away from any objects including walls and cabinets . i would not suggest letting children use the oven unsupervised . 
yes , in particular , the glass is hot enough to burn ... ... ..but note that the handle extends out from the front of the oven and provides something of a preventative barrier ... ... ..we do love this oven 
first , i will not broil a steak in this oven , it 's too much of a pain to try to clean up afterward ... as far as the cookies go , just follow the directions on the package that the cookie mix came in ... it 's an oven ... you will probably have to adjust the cooking times as i have to get the results i was looking for ... not a big deal to do ... 
hi joy , they are not thick they are the thin type . this waffle maker is great ! the waffles cook fast , are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside . i too did not want thick begium waffles and tried this maker . it is what i wanted . it cost more than others but it was worth it ! chefs choice also makes one that only makes 2 squares not four ... but waffle lovers should get the four squares . you will eat them all ! 
no they are not

no the handle dont get hot . i do n't recall if the metal gets hot or not . if i do n't recall its more then not it do n't . 
it makes 4 waffles , each roughly 3.5 x 3.5 inches square . 
there are no markings on this item to indicate if it is teflon or not . the manual does not mention the surface material . it loks and feels like teflon . 
no ... but make sure you use a spray oil without lecithin ... thays the ingredient that causes a sticky smelly buildup on non stick surfaces . i prefer bak-klene from williams-sonoma or a similar gmo free lecithin free spray from a chef supply in your area ... 
1600 watts 
you might think this one is more shallow that you prefer , as well . i specifically purchased it because it was not a belgian waffle maker , because i prefer crisp waffles . 
sorry we do not ship international via amazon . 
well , it is a popcorn popper ... ..i would n't expect it to roast beans ... 
no there is no switch . you have to plug it in and it automatically turns on . to turn it off you have to unplug it . 
bottom says `` 120 volts , a.c. , 60hz , 1440 watts '' . 
no . you can melt butter in tray scoop at the top but you still must dump it after you are finished popping the popcorn . 
hello , this popper is made in china . thank you .

1440 watts but does n't have to run for about 2-3 minutes so much , much less than a hair dryer . works great and no oily popcorn . i love it and it has a butter cup built into the top that takes out to use to pour over the popcorn if you wish to . 
wire mesh on the bottom-there are no air vents on any hot air poppers i have seen being sold . 
1440 
thick card board i think 
it seems like a really sturdy layered cardboard , so it 's light . it 's not metal or wood . the outer part is lightly padded and has a slightly plastic feel , so it would wipe clean pretty easily . i like mine a lot . 
a ton ! i 'd say at least 100 
the width of the box inside extends to 6 3 16 `` ( 6.1875 ) it wo n't fit . 
yes . the lid is hinged . 
approx 24x36 '' 
i am sorry but no . thank you 
24x36 inches 
yes , it is . i put mine in a nice 24x36 frame i got from michael 's . the paper is very lightweight , so if you do n't want it to wrinkle , after you frame it , you should mount it on a foam board . but seriously , for this low of a price , the poster is definitely worth it even if you do n't mount it before framing . 
assume you are asking about the poles that go in the corners . i made my own by cutting pvc pipe to length and stitched 1 side that they slide in to 
no mine have not pilled . 
no , they do not fit well on our california king mattress 
yes they are . they are great sheets so far . held up after washing , and have a nice soft feel . 
they will work without the polls but i strongly recommend getting the polls your sheets will never pull loose again 
microfiber 
300 and very soft just realize they do not have the stay poles . 
there is a flap in each corner of the sheet that a short pole slides into and then is tucked under the waterbed mattress . this will help keep the sheets in place ... .. 
i use it for popcorn all the time and it works great . i use the 100 calorie size so the preset popcorn time is too long but the bag rotates perfectly . 
i know that some of my bigger plates do not revolve like they did in my old microwave.the plastic type stand moves the plate then it bangs on the door . i love this microwave for my needs and that is the only fault with it.i would buy a bigger size for 11 '' 
10.3 is height , from counter top to top surface of machine . 13 '' is from your wall to face of machine 
it happened to me i broke microwave tray before , and it was complicated cause the factory would not sell the tray separated . at that time , i found a web site specific , googling `` microwave plates '' . they would find any try for any model and brand , but it was around 50 $ the tray alone . i never contacted this specific factory cause i did n't need to , but sometimes it a better to use the microwave without tray as long as you can and then order a new one . keep an eye on the sales ! 
it has a three pronged plug . 
hi . yes it does . thank you ! 
i would never put anything over a gas range . there is always that mistake from someone turning it on , and destroying the item on top . 
yes 
i would say approximately 24-30 inches . great if your electrical outlet is close . i bought it for my son who is in college and he likes it . 
18in long . 10.5 high . 13 wide.using standard box measurement.wide is front to back . 
enter 230 and you get 2 1 2 minutes however the cooking timer on this microwave runs fast , one minute cook time is only about 55 seconds . 
it really depends on the size of the tray but it 's one of the biggest microwaves i 've ever owned 
yes it does 
i 'd say about 15-16 inches . it 's slightly larger than average . great microwave by the way . 
it is 19 '' w x 12 '' d x 11 '' h. sits on a 3 1 2 ' round kitchen table and still leaves me plenty of kitchen table space . my 2 slice toaster , napkin holder and a couple other items sit on top of it . my previous micro was 1100 watt , this is 900 watt . i wanted the smaller micro footprint . took a bit of adjusting , time wise , to 900 but it is a very nice , well working micro . 
yes ... .it does beep 4 times when done ... its a low beep ... ... vince 
the front opening is only 12 1 2 inches wide and 7 inches high . 
sorry i do n't know as i bought this for a daughter in cali and had it sent there 
you need to get in touch with oster to send you another or go to their web site to download one ... .for your model ... ..vince or call 800-324-0340 they should be able to help you ... ... . 
i would get in touch with the company that made it and see if you can get another ... .. or they can fix it ... .for free ... ... it should not stop working in a month or so ... ..they need to make good on it ... or they can send you another one ... ... and you can send that one back ... ... vince 
the unit is no louder than any others i have owned . so far i love my microwave an it cooks very well . 
the front is 21.5 inches the height is 11.5 inxhwa and front to back is just a little over 14.5 inches . .5 meaning one half inch 
as described in another q & a , it is 21 inches wide . width being left to right as you 're looking at the front of it . the depth is 16 inches , and the height is 12 '' . 
you may not be setting the glass correctly on the turntable . it has to be positioned where the grooves are in order to operate correctly . try again 
that special board on the side is not the waveguide , but rather the waveguide cover . ours is not screwed in place , but is securely fitted with tabs , etc . i do n't think you want a metal screw right there , given that this would direct waves rather uncontrollably and may even cause sparks . 
i have never done that but i would think that with the right bracket any thing can be mounted 
yes the light turns on when the you open the door . also , the add 30 button works . one of the reviews said it did n't . 
asked my son , bought this for him and he says it is 12 inches . 
i could have returned mine . 
yes it does , but i think the panasonic is a much better item . i had to send my oster back . and got the panasonic . have n't had a problem with it . got the black one . comes with the cooking instruction book with details on how to cook any thing , and is big enough to cook 16 # turkey . hope this helps 
yes . the people saying that it does n't have a carousel ( turntable ) , and that it does n't turn are incorrect . it does have a rotating carousel that works perfectly . i am not happy about the stupid clock though.i did n't notice the international time on the description , and as a result it was an unpleasant surprise . other than that , it 's a cute little microwave that works well . 
does have a glass plate but does not turn inside . 
on a 3.2oz bag of pop secret hit the power button and turn the timer on to 1:40 seconds . if there is a popcorn setting i have not used it . we like ours not overcooked and listen to the kernels popping . this is the time that makes it just exactly perfect . have not tried baked potatoes yet . 
found it has to be absolutely level . 
i could n't tell you exact weight but it is very light you could set it on a couch cushion and it would n't even make a dent 
it 's a push button start . if it 's not starting you may have a defect . it 's worked really well for us . 
good question ! that is confusing ! i have n't used this feature ; initially i thought the `` 7 , 14 , 12 & 28 '' may be time settings based on the weights , but it does n't make sense that 3.5oz needs 7 minutes while 2.5 lbs ( 40 oz - more that ten times the weight ) would need 28 minutes . i checked the manual ( which i 'm sure you already did ) and it did n't elaborate any further . a call or e-mail to customer service might help : phone : ( 920 ) 347-9122 , e-mail : nostalgiaelectrics.com 
i have no idea . this question you should ask to the producer nostalgia electrics . they certain have an reasonable answer for you ! 
no u have definitely not had that problem . 
hi laurel ... not sure if you needed inside or outside dimensions , so i 'll give you both : i just measured mine : the outside is approximately 17 1 4 '' wide , 10 '' high , and 11 '' deep . the inside is approximately 11 '' wide , 6 3 4 '' high from the base ( 6 1 2 '' from the turntable ) , and 10 1 2 '' deep . i noticed these measurements differ slightly from those listed in the description . it 's compact , but takes a dinner plate with no problem . hope that helps . 
i have one of these microwaves and the measurements are as follows : width or length ( front ) = 17.5 '' , overall depth ( side ) = 13 '' , height ( from counter top ) = 10 1 4 '' . i hope this helps you ! 
yes , an 11 inch dinner plate fits inside the microwave . 
yes 
yes , it does . 
absolutely . power 10 for 3 minutes . i go 3:30 and watch it the last minute . works great . i love it 
i do n't understand the question . rephrase it . 
the actual inside measures 11 '' wide , 11 '' depth , 7 '' tall . there is 95 8 '' rotating glass plate in the middle of the bottom . you have 61 2 '' from the top of the glass plate to the top of the microwave , on the inside . 
i left it in . it has reflective material on it , so i 'm assuming it serves a purpose . been using my microwave for months now and no probs with it being in there . 
mine is actually 10.25 or so , if that makes a difference . i wanted a small microwave and am delighted with the product . 
yes . there is a dial on the micro that gives you several options for heating and cooking foods including popcorn and reheating meals . the interior glass tray also rotates for even cooking . 
outside- 11 3 4 '' deep , 10 '' tall and 17.5 '' wide . inside is 10 '' deep , 7.5 '' tall and 11 3 4 wide . i ca n't fit a tall mug in there . i can just barely fit a standard plate in there . be warned the glass plate inside does not fit on the rail correctly and is constantly coming off and clanking around . 
its 13 inches deep with the hump 
yes it does 
no . it has a three prong plug . 
yes their are on the left side . enjoy hadey mae on facebook madeas lost sister . thanks for the question . 
3 then 4 when opening door 
there is a timer which is audible when the food is done . 
yes 
i could n't get this microwave to cook at all . i 'm giving mine away . i went down to best buy and bought a emerson ( the same type ) and took out an insurance policy on it ! 
i lost the directions . never could make it work . i put it in the trash 
8 '' fills it . the shells are n't very large when done , but not too bad . 
there is no size , it takes small tortillas . works great ! 
each tortilla takes about 3 minutes . 
this machine runs on 120volts . if you are an international buyer , you will need a converter for this machine . 
use a medium sized tortilla , and it will measure : 6 '' wide at the top , 4 '' wide at the bottom , and 2 '' deep . the fried shells are , of course tastier , but these are pretty darn good , and better for you . bake a minute longer than it says to . 
hi ! thank you for your note . we get many questions like this from all over the world . these nostalgia machines are all made for 120volts . you will need a voltage converter to run the macgine safely . we always recommend that you go to your local electronics store and find a convertor that will work best for your country . i wish we had them in 220. everyone loves the machines ! they are so clever and handy ! please let us know if we can help you further ... caren 
possibly , but i do not think i would try it . the tortilla 's are already made and this just forms to the bowl . 
you can use almost any dough flour or wheat 
yes it is . please contact us 
120volt 50 60 
does come with 'cigarette lighter ' style dc adapter . but i would only plug it in when the engine is running . probably drain the battery otherwise . 
it 's small . it can hold four 16 ounce water bottles standing up , or six 12 ounce cans laying flat . it keeps them cold , but not ice cold unfortunately . but it does exactly what i wanted to and is very convenient . it can be used in an ac outlet indoors or in the car , and comes with a car adapter . 
my husband has this at the head of his bed . he is diabetic and prefers his apple juice or orange juice box and his water bottle colder than room temperature . he also keeps his glucose packet in there . others have said that it is a glorified cooler but it does keep things about 30 degrees cooler than room temp . 
if i am reading the label on it right.. it says 45-50 watts next to teh ac info . but do n't hold me to that . lol 
i purchased this mini fridge for my office . it worked well for 3 months but then although the fan continued to work , it would no longer cool . there is no way to repair it and when i contacted the seller , i was told the warranty had expired . after only three months of use , i had to throw it away . 
37 degrees 
plastic 
yes . it gets real cold 
no 
no 
i use 2 scoops for 1 large cup of coffee . i also use the turkish grind from starbucks . 
hi - the diameter is almost 4.5 inches . 
i 'm not sure -- four to six inches i think . 
yes they are . this is basically a cotton sock on a wire frame , so you can wash it as much as you want . ask any grandmother , and they 'll tell you all you should do is rinse it out after each use , and just let it dry . one of the best ways to make coffee . 
it 's 100 % white cotton . i do n't know if it 's unbleached . mike 
i 'm not sure ... . only used it for regular lunch items ... .but looked sturdy . 
it is microwave safe , so i just assumed it was dishwasher safe too . have been putting it in the top rack with no problem ; still a waterproof seal . 
the separate 'sandwich box ' , which can be used to hold anything , has a lid that closes nicely , and stays on tightly , but does not actually lock . a rubber band may work . i posted a video at www.kamipeck.com . hope it helps 
yes it does . 
yes it is made in china . i have this product and love it . it is one of the few products that are compact enough to fit in a backpack or bag but gives lots of room for your lunch items . i would recommend this product as a great lunch box . it is durable and has not stained and cleans up very well . 
3pc set = item dimensions : 10 '' l x 6 '' w x 2 1 4 '' h 4pc set = item dimensions : 11 '' l x 6 3 4 '' w x 2 1 4 '' h all dimensions are extremely close but may not be exact . 
i would say 2 and 3 year olds although small 4 year olds may be able to use it also . we use it for our 2 year old and she loves it . 
i contacted the company , simplyglobo , on 03 11 2014 , and was told , `` the actual dimensions of the sleeping area for the lazynap lz-04k kids air mattress are : 43 '' x20 '' x8 '' . hopefully this information helps other interested buyers - the company should update the product details description though to make sure that everyone sees the information . 
to be fair it is cold and everything that is deflates faster . we used the bed back in september 
it has its own and it t is pretty good . a crib one will be too small and a single one too big 
about 2 to 3 minutes 
not at all ! it comes with an electric pump and takes about 2-3 minutes to fully inflate . 
i do n't find that an issue.sorry 
i would not put anyone on it over 3 years old , mine ripped right on the seam . 
love these jars ! and no the color does not wash off.. 
yes 
8 oz but i would not order again . when they came in all in the box were broken . unless they change their packing i am sure they will not arrive in good condition . my neighbor ordered them to and they had the same experience two of them were broken in their box . i returned the box of broken glass . 
8 oz aboiy 
yes they are . 
yes 
hi , this item holds 16oz in each jar . thank you , lily 's home customer service 
yes you can use standard lids with glass ... also they are very sturdy i love these i bought two sets 
it is not real leather , but it is a really good quality vinyl . i am very happy with this product and the price was reasonable . 
product dimensions : 24 x 24 x 17.8 inches ; 25 pounds 
it is 24 '' square and 17 '' tall . 
it is more of an espresso brown . 
4x4 
13 '' h x 19 '' x 19 '' 
it is made of bonded leather . thank you ! 
i can definitely sit on it , and i 'm 150 lbs . our kids climb on it all the time ( ages 5 & 2 ) and its super sturdy . i do n't know the measurements off hand , but i can assure you that its sturdy for sitting climbing ! 
it just has a flat bottom , so no legs . not attaching the wheels means you 'd have to pick it up for movement which would work , but it 's a pretty solid piece to have to constantly move around unless you 're leaving it stationary . 
yes 
it does come with wheels and moves very easily the wheels do n't have to be used 
i 'm pretty sure it 's 30 '' x30 '' . check the product details i 'm pretty sure it says the size . 
no very good quality 
i dont know but its very nice good quality and u can store alot in the inside 
30.5 square 14 inches tall . 
that 's not normal . orders should be processed , at most , 8 business days , depending on the type of item . in rare cases , if the item needs to be manufactured after the order has been placed , it may take about 10-15 business days . however , most items are ready to ship from the factory warehouse within 1-2 business days , unless you purchased from an international merchant . please check with the merchant and find out where they are located , and why your item still has n't been shipped . 
first things first : always use caution choosing your bottles - regardless of what they 're made of . make sure bottles you choose to use will withstand the rigors of carbonation pressures . a glass perrier bottle is no exception . do n't trust it unless you 've tested it . rule of thumb : do n't pressurize any bottle until you 've tested it and you know the bottle is suitable . the last thing you want is to have a bottle burst . if you want to know how to test bottles , search for this code on youtube : zbj-wd5rvgi copy and paste the 11-character code exactly as it appears above in the youtube search box to find the video . watch the video . learn from it . when you are confident you understand the process , test some bottles . the beverage industry standard level of carbonation is 8-grams per liter . if you add 8-grams of co2 to a common 1-liter bottle with 1-liter of water in it , you have successfully carbonated it to the beverage industry standard . for your test , you might try adding 16-grams of co2 to the bottle . if it does not burst with 16-grams of co2 in it , it is unlikely to burst under the pressure of only 8-grams of co2 . and last , you specifically mentioned a 10oz club soda bottle and a 750ml perrier bottle . a 10oz bottle carbonated to the beverage industry standard would contain 2.36-grams of co2 . a 750ml perrier bottle carbonated to the beverage industry standard would contain 6-grams of co2 . hope this helps . 
the caps can be used over and over again . it works really well . 
16g bulbs 3.40 '' long with 8.3mm dia unthreaded necks . can be found in most bicycle shops in north and south america . 
i asked mrfizz the same question in a email and below is the response that i received : thanks for inquiring about the fizz giz home station . the home station is an add-on product for customers who already own a fizz giz kit . i do not sell the home station on amazon . the home station lets you connect your hand-held black banana shaped co2 dispenser to a paintball tank . i do not sell paintball tanks . they are a commodity and i simply can not compete with walmart , dick 's sporting goods or sports authority or the vast number of little mom 'n pop shops selling paintball supplies all over the country . here 's a description of the home station . here 's how it 's hooked up to a medium tank . and here 's how it 's used with a big tank . should work great within minutes of taking it out-a-the box . the biggest plus about having a home station to go with your fizz giz kit is co2 cost . the co2 in the little 16-gram bulbs costs you about 20-cents for a single serving sized 12oz drink . it only takes 1-cents worth of co2 to make one using gas from a paintball tank and only half-a-cent worth of co2 from a big tank . do n't get me wrong . the little co2 bulbs are as handy as a pocket on a shirt to toss in a tackle box or a bike bag . but for routine day-to-day use around the house , they can get a little pricey . i recommend people use them only when portability is a high priority . the home station costs $ 37.95 and used to take me a few days to build 'n ship ; but now i have them in-stock and can ship same next day . it comes with the base unit ( that actually screws to your tank ) , a 6-ft hose and a modified co2 bulb . i appreciate your interest . hope this helps . pls forgive the home-baked , country-fried , grass-roots approach i take with my demos and explanations . sodastream sells more of their soda makers every hour than i 've sold in 2-years . do n't expect hi- $ $ $ fancy ad slicks here . it just ai n't in the cards for me . please know that you are dealing with a small business . my company is essentially a one-man operation . but being small does n't mean being 2nd rate . watch this clip from a popular canadian tv show and you 'll understand perfectly . the show is part of the oprah winfrey network ( own ) . it airs in canada and in 55 other countries . it does not air in the usa . you have to tell me if you want your home station compatible with the smaller paintball sized tanks or compatible with the larger co2 tanks with conventional valves - they have different fittings . i would like for you to watch this before ordering a home station for a paintball sized tank . afterward , you can tell me if you want me to supply a paintball tank main valve pre-fitted to your home station base unit . and , if you do want a pre-fitted main valve , please note that i only fit and sell on-off type valves . i do not sell pin-valves . the choice is entirely up to you . on-off valves let you control pressure to the entire system from a single point . depressurizing the system when not in use can extend the life of your paintball tank 's main valve o-ring . screwing the home station base unit on and off the tank is much easier when the pressure is turned off at the source with an on-off valve . and it can eliminate the possibility of slow leaks at other points in the system . my on off valve is exactly like this one , and is priced at $ 12.45 to my customers . the home station base unit is a multi-purpose tool . have you seen this ? what about this ? sincerely , mrfizz @ fizzgiz.com ( 409 ) fizz-giz check out my fizz giz soft drink maker . 
the little c02 cartridges are disposable . you can box boxes of different quantities up to 100 if you like . the little c02 cartridges are convenient ; however , if you use the soda maker quite a bit , you might consider buying a refillable c02 tank and then you would need the hose adapter . i have n't done this , but i recall looking at that option . 
maybe , if your pour the wine into the carbonating bottle . have n't tried it . 
try the sparkling ice bottles . that beverage is sold right here on amazon . 
fizz giz comes with everything needed to start carbonating soda . mine came with two 16g co2 cartridges that got me started , you can order more of them , search amazon for redrock distributing : http : www.amazon.com 20-gram-unthreaded-co2-cartridges dp b001qa68li ref=sr_1_4 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1410872716 . for flavorings , you can search the web for many great recipes , most of which can be made healthier than what you 'd buy in the store . 
not even one.. : - not liking it . too lazy to return it 
it does n't technically cook food . it reheats . if you mean something like a lean cuisine then yes , it will work for that . it heats food in plastic , glass or metal . i vacuum seal a lot of food and it reheats just fine in that bag . hope this helps . 
i just emailed the company tonight , i was wondering the same ... `` draws 45 watts '' : - ) 
it worked great in the car . 
no 
i used mine several times to heat up jimmy dean breakfast bowls . i would place the retail box in the mini at bed time , plug it in and enjoy the breakfast in the morning . worked great , so i figured i could make my own breakfast as well using three wisked eggs , some diced onions green peppers and a little sausage . i use a pyrex container with lid and place the mixture in the mini before i go to bed , plug it in , and in the morinig i have a great hot breakfast . 
i ordered my hotlogic for my office about a month ago & it 's terrific ! i put frozen food ( in either glass or plastic ) in when i get to work , and it 's hot by lunchtime - never too hot . i 've put a grilled sandwich from the night before wrapped in foil , perfect ... cold home made soup in a plastic container - takes about an hour to heat up . never seems to overheat , no cold spots like a microwave . i 'm amazed actually ! 
i could n't find a pyrex dish that was really a good fit - they were all too big to fit into the carrier and zip the top closed . it may help to know that the carrier 's dimensions are 6 '' long x 5 '' wide x 2 1 2 '' deep . i did find from ziploc a small casserole dish in their versaglass line http : www.ziploc.com whatsnew pages ziplocversaglasscontainers.aspx that left a little extra room in it , but it is n't large enough to hold a meal for 2 adults . a better solution for me was to buy some disposable aluminum cooking pans - they fit perfectly in the carrier , but the only place i have been able to find them was at gordon 's food service , or at the dollar store in a three pack for $ 1 . are you planning to make a meal in it for a family ? if yes , a large casserole dish will not fit ... not even a 5 x 7 or loaf pan will fit . 
i used the rubbermaid `` take alongs '' which fit perfectly in the portable oven . it has a red lid . it holds 4 cups . that will give you an idea of portion size as well . 
it takes 1 hour to heat refrigerated food completely .food comes out steaming as if it was just cooked ! worth every penny 
i have n't used a glass container yet but the plastic containers do get pretty hot so i would n't suggest it for children unless heated for less than 1 hour . after 1 hour the food lets off steam so it could be dangerous for children . hope this helps ! 
no they can not smell it because your container is closed . i 've tried many containers inside the unit . currently i use a glass container inside . it works wonders ! try pyrex with a lid or my favorite is a glass container from the container store . p.s . i had cabbage today . no smell at work . 
just in an electrical outlet . but i have bought mine to use just as you want . just look for one 12v to 110v inverter . choose one with 75w or higher and be happy ! 
i have never `` cooked '' anything , only heat precooked meals . the best meals are those that are moist since the heat is distributed better . i imagine one could actually cook with the hot logic or even steam veggies with a bit of water added . 
i 've used a variety of frozen entrees , and how long they take to heat up depends upon the thickness of the tray . heating occurs by means of a hot plate at the bottom , so i would say the more contact you have with the hotplate the better . a typical frozen entre takes around an hour to an hour and a half to get hot all through . your food wo n't `` cook '' ; it should be already cooked ; but it will get quite hot . aluminum is a good conductor of heat , and since burritos are round and would n't make good contact , i 'd suggest wrapping the burrito in aluminum foil , and at the same time , see if you can find an aluminum tray with sides on it that will fit the burrito as closely as possible . maybe one that would be used to bake a small loaf of bread . that way , the sides will get as hot as the bottom where the hotplate is and with the foil on wrapped around it , the heating process will be much quicker . 
only the bottom is hard the rest is a soft material . you can store it in a smaller space . 
no 
according to the instructions , leave the plastic on and do not pierce , i.e. , do not poke holes in the plastic . hotlogic works best when the seal remains intact . 
no 
i 'm thinking it would work using a marine boat battery ( deep cycle ) but they 're pretty heavy . 
i 'm not familiar with `` microwave safe '' products but i 'm fairly certain that the hotlogic will not set anything on fire . the worst it 's done for me is bake rice crusty onto the sides of my glass pyrex container . do n't know if that means it will melt anything . 
yes , but it is a white plastic and flat spatula without a handle and is useful to fold your omelet . 
would be great for just one egg ! i usually use it for 2 eggs over easy ... one on each side 
yes 
each side is used to assemble one omelet : eggs first ... then add toppings . after heating to desired consistency , the scraper is used to `` roll up '' each omelette into a perfectly-presented creation . it 's not what i expected either ... but it works great . 
i bought 2 of these pans for lasagna . i took the magnet off the refrigerator and it would not stick to the pan , inside or out , nor the lid . i wish the bottom was completely flat instead of some elevation , then it might be better for a cake . i am happy with the pans as they work for what i wanted them for . 
the 13.25 x 9.5 is the outside edges of the pan . 
yes 
shiny 
my pan is around 2 1 4 '' deep . 
it is stainless steel , not aluminum . a beautiful pan- a magnet does not stick 
it is not totally flat . it has a raised ring around the bottom and then flattens out . so , if you were to back a cake and turn it upside down , you would have an indent on the cake bottom where the pan is raised . the ring is about 1 2 inch wide and about 1 2 inch in from outside of the pan . 
definitely clicks when you put on the lid . then the lid is somewhat loose while on . it would not come off if you shook it , it requires a little force to remove the lid . the lid is not airtight . 
yes this pan is a cake pan , to use in the oven 
yes 
two lids 
i have the 3 gallon and it fits perfectly . 
search amazon for ohio stoneware 11600 crock cove ( `` cover '' is misspelled ) . it fits the 1 gallon ohio stoneware crock . i do not own it myself , as i have the 3 gallon crock and cover instead . good luck ! 
they fit the 3 gallon crock . on the inside cover is the number 3. we purchased both the crock and the set of 2 lids so we could make sour kraut . 
23.5 is the width . it is 15.5 high 
vertical space between the shelves is 6.5 inches . 
it 's a wood grain pattern in an espresso color . 
that depends on what kind of shoes you put on . three pairs of flats ? no problem . three pairs of sneakers ? nah . 
i would n't . might support the weight of a child , but i do n't think it 's sturdy enough for an adult . 
the space between shelves is roughly 6 1 2 inches , so it depends on the height of the boots.. 
i think so . better if you use velcro dots between them for better stability 
i have the steam beach white combination and have n't had any issues with wet shoes causing problems ( and i 'm in wi where we have lots of sludgy , sloppy snow ) . 
about an inch 
i do't think they can 
the time out period of the scale turns is 2 minutes . 
this takes place when it is zeroed tared . this is a digital device . the firmware does the work . 
one for ounces , none for grams milliliters . 
9.9 x 0.7 x 5.9 inches . 
on mine , i can put the weight on and then tap the on off tare function on the left . the scale beeps and resets to zero after a slight lag . during that lag , the scale looks like it is n't responding , then it resets . 
it will show 1 lb 8 oz really is the greatest scale : ) 
not sure what you are describing . to weigh something with a container.. i put the empty container on the scale tap once on the left side `` button '' and it zeros out . then add the ingredient amount needed to the container by weight . if you need to add a second ingredient by weight tap once again.. it will zero out . 
it will stay on the setting it was on when it was last shut off . 
wow . the questioner is absolutely correct . the displayed answer ... not so much . 
yes , i wondered the same , as 14 settings would have been great ! that is not right ... .there are 12 complete place settings , plus 12 extra teaspoons . 
i have been watching this for a while and reading every comment possible to discern if this was the original ( not frosted ) pattern ... ..it is not the gorham ribbon edge ii frosted ! it is similar to the 2007 discontinued style ... .probably a little more shiny . 
i love , love this gorham pattern . it is ribbon edge and on the in light it says vietnam ! never noticed the country but i still love this beautiful gorham stainless . it is heavy larger than my onidea pattern which have had about 45 years . truly beautiful ! ! ! ! 
they cut better than most normal dinner knives . they 're not serrated but are quite sharp . hope that helps ! 
had to return my 89 , as the offer said golden , but it was stainless color only . meanwhile , have purchased 2 place settings elsewhere and quality not good ... vietnam . i am seeing some offers out there now for korean ... .might better try those . 
they are heavy but i think they are hollow . 
the only pieces that might not stack would be the knives . the set is really nice - great quality . 
everything but the knives can be stacked . 
they stack 
i just checked and they do stack well , right on top of each other . they would probably fall off each other in the course of a drawer opening and closing , but sitting still , the bottom of one piece nestles fairly well with the top of the next piece . i did n't try the knives but assume they do not stack : - ) 
there are two styles of plates offered in this pattern . there are round place settings and there are square place settings . this place setting features the round plates . the square plates and place settings are more expensive . 
the dinner plates are 11.5 inches 
the mugs hold 2 cups to the brim , 12oz 3 4 filled , 8oz 1 2 filled . 
i 'm not sure why the blue set comes with a pink creamer and sugar bowl . i have the aqua set and the pink matches perfectly with that set . 
yes- it 's actually a five piece per place setting not the four shown . 
yes , it is dishwasher safe , and microwave safe too . 
these plates are smooth and have no texture on them . i have had the set for a couple of weeks now . they are light , but tough ( three kids 14 , 12 and 10 ) and very pretty ! 
i would say pure whit . definitely no blue-and no yellow towards cream 
these are so simple that matching will be easy . personally , i use them with other serving dishes to add pops of color or to change with the season . 
no , they are not hot . i put them in the microwave often and never have a problem . 
imo it is not as thin or light as corelle , but is certainly thinner and lighter than stoneware . it is just what i expected for a set of china . 
i wash them in the dishwasher and store them in the cabinet in which i use them everyday with no problems . 
the dinner plate is 10-1 4 inches and the salad plate is just under 8-1 4 inches 
avalon run i purchased because it is bone china . it is dishwasher & microwave safe . it is white , simple can go with any type of decor , food ... great buy ! 
i own a set and fortunately did not have that happen , however , if it did i would email write to gorham to see if it would be possible to buy just one cup . failing that , ebay , replacements or why ca n't amazon arrange for you to buy just one replacement ? ! 
very durable . i put these in the dishwasher all the time and no issue . my husband dropped a mug on our granite counter and the handle only got a slight crack , was surprised it did n't shatter . 
no , but they are pretty sharp for table knives . 
standard size plus salad forks 
no 
the only imprint says gorham or gorham 18 20 . 
i do not know about the column design , but i have the gorham ribbon design , and the pattern is on both surfaces - front and back - of the pieces . i like my set very much , and use it every day for our family . the only thing i do differently , is , that because it is very shiny , it shows water spots , etc. , so will take a damp dry clean towel occasionally , and wipe spotless . 
yes 
the sizes are pretty much what you would expect.. the dinner forks are long and solid . tea spoons are not too large ; soup spoons are larger but not too big . we 're very happy with the set . 
there are 12 teaspoons and 12 soup spoons , plus my set also included a couple of serving spoons . 
no , but they are pretty sharp for table knives . 
standard size plus salad forks

no , they are much lighter as compared to stoneware . i think they compare in weight to the average bone china . 
they are authentic lenox . i have other carved pieces and they match perfectly ! 
no they do not . glassy surface not marked by anything . 
dinner plates are 11 '' , salad plates 9 '' , cereal bowls are 6 1 2 '' across , about 2 1 2 '' deep , coffee mugs almost 4 '' across top , 4 1 4 '' tall . the 5th piece is a very large soup bowl ( although you can probably use it as a serving bowl also ) that is 9 '' across , 2 '' deep . 
it is white on white . beautiful ! 
no 
there is a pastabowl not shown . i bought this a few weeks ago and i love it ! it 's so beautiful . 
no , the opal innocence carved porcelain dinnerware in made in china . 
dont see why not . i freeze coffee in em 
i use mine to freeze stocks regularly . while the stocks are not as acidic as tomato sauce , i would n't hesitate to use them for that purpose . 
it 's actually pretty hard to simply pop out because the ice cubes are so thick . i had to flip it upside down and melt it a little with water first and then push the ice cubes out individually . 
the top is obviously 90 's but the inside corners are beveled . these cubes are great . you can get three or four short cocktails from one cube . they last forever ! 
yes they stack well . open easy 
not sure exactly . but it is n't much longer than regular cubes . 
china 
as stated in the description , yes . i returned these as i found them difficult on all levels . according to the reviews , i must be alone . 
4.4 fluid oz . per cube , they are 2 '' x 2 '' x 2 '' . they fit nicely in a lowball glass . 
i just checked the site , they come from china . 
it has rechargeable ni-cad batteries , so repeated charging before the batteries are depleted will cause the `` memory effect '' , shortening the life-span . 
no i have n't had that issue before , i 've only had it a few weeks and i did not have that issue so far . 
yes ... two attachments . one brush , and one crevice tool . 
no 
yes you can replace the battery but it costs almost the same as buying a new unit . 
no 
i do n't know about cats , but it picks up the hair of my dog when i clean my car . 
the wall mount is plugged in , the vac charges when attatched to the wall mount . 
not any noisier than all their others . let me tell you though . it 's a piece of junk . not like they were when they first came out . very small diet holder , nowhere to put accessory parts , loses suction fast and is mostly like a kid 's toy . do n't buy it and if you did , bring it back . i did . 
yes 
4.5 '' wide ... 4.75 '' high ... 5.38 '' deep 
i got the chrome one 
yes 
i think it is lifetime the box said , but there were no papers to send off for a warantee , so i guess there really isnt one lol 
only one . the medium pot lid fits the smallest fry pan . 
after a year of use just like that no marks and still nonstick . very happy with these . 
the set contains 3 pans , 11 '' , 9 '' , and a smaller one that is 7 1 2 '' . it 's great for making omelets . i 've had numerous pot and pan sets , this is by far one of the best . 
large pot holds 4 quarts ; medium pot holds 1.5 quarts ; and small tiny pot holds .5 quarts ; 
no , it is not oven safe 
true but you can wash them in the dishwasher without ruining them . the water stains wipe ofg with viniger 
8 , 9.5 & 11 inch skillets ; 1 & 2 qt.pots ; 5 qt . dutch oven . a great set ! 
no not at all 
the extra large fry pan ? no lid . the big pot yes . 
gently use a screw driver or butter knife to get under the trim ring to get it out . 
i do n't know , think it fits all ge mics , it did mine . 
i bought mine for model # jvm135obw . i did a search for my part number on the manufacturer website and then bought it off of amazon . 
i am not able to help as i do not know what models it fits or does not fit . it did fit the microwave for which i ordered it . i do know that it is the bottom screw where the break occurs . ge did a poor job in design and manufacture . 
we do n't believe it did . 
9.5 inches . i 'm not sure about almond , but to a search in amazon . 
not sure- mine is jvm1339bw002 . i bet it does , but i would measure to make sure ! 
there are 2 screws that hold it on . one at the bottom and one at the top . one of the screws requires that you remove the inner `` trim ring '' which just snaps out . be careful to not over tighten as this handle is plastic and you could damage it . 
sorry- i do n't know the answer . good luck ! 
it has been months since i ordered mine . but i think the number your asking about is the same number mine was . an it did work . 
hi kara . this jar is approximately 8.2 inches tall by 3 inches wide . i hope this helps ! 
20.2 fluid ounces . 
i measured to the top ridge and its 18 oz . hope that helps 
these jars are tall and skinny they work great for canning asparagus or beans anything that is longer than average quart jar . i buy them mostly for there cool style factor because i give them as gifts . 
yes , and they 're beautiful . i 've used these jars for gifts ! a 
yes try def nylon and strong ! and durable . we 've had them for 2 months with constant use , still going strong ... . 
there are no markings on the bags or packaging , however enko products is in poland . 
i 'm sure you can boil them if you 'd like , but i just wash mine with dish detergent and let them air dry after using . 
they are tiny , just enough to extract to extract the almond milk , not the pulp , 
the large bags are huge ... you should be fine to do that much.. if not a little more.. 
it 's takes just a couple minutes to strain the milk and you can squeeze as much or as little as u want . i let the milk run out on its own as much a possible before squeezing . if you want the absolute most out of your almonds , there is a fair amount of squeezing twisting , but nothing that 's `` excessive '' . 
the bottoms are not seamed , so even though it 's straight across , it does kind of round out when it 's filled with nut milk and pulp . i love mine . 
i personally have n't tried it for making cheese and do n't know what the process involves . i have only used it to make nut milks and have had good results . the mesh appears very strong and able to hold up against a good deal of pressure from squeezing . do n't know if that helps . 
yes it will fit with no problem an you can fold it over . i use the wide mouth quart size my self it seems to work better then anything else because the top really is n't wide enough . 
nylon 
i have only used it for making almond and walnut nut milk . i am sorry i could not be of more help . 
rachel , this is a very sturdy , in fact kind of stiff , tightly woven nylon bag . i 'm sure it is really going to last . my first one was a softer nylon that was springing little leaks that would squirt me - lol -- when i squeezed the last of the milk out . you wo n't have that problem with these , imo . these rinse out beautifully . i hope you enjoy yours , if you order them . 
no , the bag is made in china . 
designed in utah and assembled in china . we have two and both are great ! very loud and accurate which is what we needed . hope this helps . 
i find it very easy to operate . if she 's not good with electronics , it would only take a minute to show her the process . after the timer goes off , it records how many seconds it rang , so you need to clear that before the next use . you simply hit the stop button twice . the first time stops the timer from beeping and the second time clears the recorded seconds . it says stop clear right on the button . this is the loudest timer i 've ever found and i 've owned a lot of timers . i wo n't leave the room with something on the stove without a timer to remind me . i could n't hear most of the others . i 've never missed hearing this one ! ! ! 
it uses a 9 volt battery which , with normal use , should last for over a year . i absolutely love this timer ! 
99 hours 99 mins and 99 seconds 
yes , just one . 
the thermoworks extra big and loud has be manually shut off . 
there are four volume settings and the lowest volume would be fine for an apartment . if you think that is too loud , i put a piece of scotch tape over the speaker hole and the volume got even quieter . 
i purchased this for my grandma who can not hear much without her hearing aids . she loves it . she uses the highest level and can hear it from several rooms away . the magnet on it is really strong as well . when it is on the stainless steel fridge it seems to be louder . 
yes . my parents are practically deaf and they can hear it 
yes this works for me and i also have high freq hearing loss 
i am the reviewer with the peeling problem . i have now washed it many times in the dishwasher over the past few months and it peels a little bit more each time . after 3 months of use , it is now about 1 4 silver ( peeled ) and 3 4 gold . otherwise , it works fine for keeping my coffee hot warm . 
it is not glass on the inside ... .. more like plastic . it did n't keep the coffee hot for very long since it is n't glass . 
it 's not that heavy in my opinion , but it is a very low quality product . i would not recommend it . 
not spill-proof . the lid is hinged ... does n't screw down . take it to parties only if your wife is in the passenger seat holding it . i actually do n't like it . go on ebay and get a pfaltzgraff insulated thermal carafe ( not mfd anymore i do n't think ) . glass interior , like the old thermos bottles , screw-down lid ... you might have a chance of taking it to a party ... try to find one nib . 
there is no navy . it is shades of taupe . it is lovely . 
yes 
i own one and it is definitely taupe 
yes 
6 steak 1 chef 1 veg 1 bread 1 filet 2 universal and scissors all in all not a bad set cut very well 
its wood 
symmetrically-cut , two-dimensional serrated edges for precision slicing stainless-steel blades never needs sharpening full tangs triple-riveted to handles hand wash only limited lifetime warranty 
i purchased about 6 months ago . still sharp but if you do not hand wash they will show spots of rust . 
really didnt show it or i would have read it dumbass ! 
yes , they are . 
yes they are 
these are full tang knives ... the tangs extend to the entire length of the handle . the handle is made of a composite material ( hard plastic ) . the handles consist of two pieces of the composite material riveted in three places . 
these knives contain carbon so prolonged periods of moisture such as a dishwasher or soaking in a sink can lead to rust issues on the blade and under the handle plus the harsh detergents can stain the metal and the high heat can cause the handles to crack . dishwasher safe knives have a coating to prevent rust spotting and are available on amazon also and are less expensive too so that may be another option . 
you need to talk to an amazon customer service person . prime members pay about $ 99.99 a year and en they get benefits from amazon like deals on shipping , movies and other savings . 
china if i knew this before i would not have bought this item 
i really would like to see this question answered myself ! handles we got ! what are the blades ? is there a paring knife in that pile ? 
what 's in the box ? 8 '' slicer , 8 '' chef 's knife , 7 '' santoku knife , 5 '' utility knife , 5.5 '' boning knife , ( 6 ) 4.5 '' steak knives , 3.5 '' paring knife , kitchen shears , and black storage block . 
gave it as a gift . she loves it 
no . steak knives are serrated . and the bread knife . and a few other are serrated and a few are not serrated . 
all except the largest knife is serrated . the scissors are regular scissors . i love my set . 
i have owned this set for a few months now . i have not tried to sharpen them because they are still as sharp as the first day i got them . they do not show sign of dullness . hope this helps . 
one year in and we love these pans . they are very efficient so we had to adapt to lower stove settings than we were used to . occasionally we get one too hot and it gets a coating of gummy oil , comes off with a paste of baking soda left on overnight . we also keep felt between them in the cabinets to keep them from getting scratched . little more care than we were used to but they are the best pans we 've ever used . still use stainless or cast iron for some meals but these get used the most . i think the complaints are from people using too high of heat and or using abrasive cleaners . 
i guess it is luck of the draw but i have lids that happen to fit . try the two quart revere ware lid if you have one . 
8 '' & 10 '' 
8 '' and 12 in 
yes - i love these pans 
check description on amazon ... it says that yes they are free of them . 
ours did not . 
yes , it will work on induction ranges . and to the person that replied saying `` i do n't know , i 'm really amateurish '' , why even bother answering the question ? 
i honestly do n't know . i do n't have an inductance cooking system -- use a regular electric range . that sounds like something you 'd have to ask the manufacturer . 
it fits my daughers full bed very nice it 's a great item 
yes but also purchased them through amazon the comforter comes with two pillow case holders and the set of sheets as well so you will have an extra pair i love the comforter it 's very soft colors are vibrant worth every pennie . 
hi..no ... only the comforter and the shams 
both the outer shell and inner fill are 100 % polyester.the cover is made in china and the product is filled and finished in the usa . 
it is surface washable only . 
this is approx 15 - 15 1 2 inches tall . 
john -- -i really dont know -- -however -- -my guess is that it is the cording that brings the edges of the material together -- -- -it is much fatter -- heavier than the usual cording you see -- if you know someone who sews , they can show you -- -it 's all over the place , on pillows , cushions etc . actually it makes this item at least seem -- very substantial . google up `` cording on pillows '' ===see what you get -- good luck ! 
fred i am sorry but i can not help.i would suggest taking a twin size sheet and making a cover.if you have any sewing skills . just a thought . 
you probably would be better off buying new backrest . material to cover them is expensive . 
i do n't know the width . i bought it for my nephew , and he not a small man . he said it was very comfortable . 
i 'm not sure of actual material but it is n't cotton . it is very smooth , soft and velvety like velour and is thick not flimsy . it is soooo comfy . i luv it . i can check tag on it tomorrow and let you know actual material content . this is very nice . i hope this helps . 
it 's 18 inches high , very plush , and comfortable . 
18 inches 
it 's a little booklet that says thanks for purchasing the machine and it tells you all the flavors they carry and a short description of what aromas and characteristics each have . 
the nespresso welcome kit contains 16 capsules . 
i bought this from amazon , and it works fine on120v . 
nespresso umilk is the model name . all nespresso machines will make expresso at a minimum . the attached milk frother will make the milk part of your latte . there 's a couple of youtube videos you can watch to see how its exactly made . 
no , i 'm sorry but we do not carry any of the nespressos in the 220v . 
yes , the credit is for any nespresso machine over $ 179 purchased anywhere between 11 29 13 and 1 26 14. see all t & c here : http : www.nespresso.com promotion us en yeppromo13 disclaimer . you must submit all required supporting documents . not that it does say valid in the us only . a great promo ! 
no , this unit does not come with a glass . 
yes it does come with a sample pod pack . 
yes . since the aeroccino is integrated . 
the basket hooks fit a door that is 2 cm thick the basket hooks are 8 inches apart including the hooks which are 1 cm wide from the top of hooks to the start of basket there are 3.5 inches high the basket is 10 inches deep-high at top the basket is 10 inches wide and at bottom it is 9.5 inches wide at top the basket is 4.5 inches thick and 3 inches thick at bottom . you can fit 2 rolls of toilet paper side by side and one on top of another = 4 rolls per basket the basket is not a perfect rectangular container it is wider at top then at bottom . 
basket itself is : 9 '' w x 5 '' d and 10 '' h ... a bit smaller than i would have liked . does n't hold a lot . 3 bags of marshmallows tops : ) wire is a bit flimsy also . it 's okay but thought i was getting a larger more sturdy basket . ca n't complain for the price , i guess . 
nope ... i used it to hold all those plastic grocery bags everyone packs items in ... used one to line and stuff in the rest of them ... not as large as i would 've like it to be . 
15inches top to bottom . basket is 12 '' x 10 '' x 5 '' , fits a plastic grocery bag great . 
there is nothing on this rack to hinder placing as wide a plate as you 'd like . the only thing is the height , and yes , the height would fit an 11 inch high plate . any taller is questionable . 
not sure , have n't tried yet . sorry . maybe we have to provide our own screws ! 
i do n't have exact measurements but it is huge ! i was under the impression it was smaller and i could use for a few plates ... no ! it 's 3-4 ft. tall . still in box because i have nothing to use it for ... 
they seem to be mounted fine 
not heavy , but does not fold up well -- -more like `` l '' shape . otherwise is a good floor product if your bottom is not big 
are you asking how to put it in a reclining position ? start with it completely flattened , and as you lift the back , there are several position levels , from most reclined to 90 degree position . if you want to go back to a more reclined position , you push the back forward from the 90 degree level , and then pull it backward to its flattened state and start over . 
hi michael , the dimensions are l : 21.5 '' w : 14 '' h : 6 '' inches at it highest ( where the bottom of the chair folds up which is about a quarter of the length of the chair when folded ) and less than an inch in height for the rest length of the chair when folded . it comes with a stury plastic bag that it fits into nicely . hope that helps . 
yes . the cover has a zipper and can be taken off to wash . 
the following measurements are for the basket part only ( they do not include the arms ) . when looking straight at the basket as seen in the picture with the arms at the back : left-right at the front bottom = 9 inches left-right at the back bottom = 9 inches left-right at the front top = 9.5 inches left-right at the back top = 10.3 inches front-back on bottom ( includes .5 inch gap from cabinet door to back wall of basket ) = 4.75 inches front-back on top ( includes gap from cabinet door to back of basket ) = 5.4 inches height ( top to bottom ) at back = 8.5 inches height at front = 6.75 inches 
hello . it 's 14 '' from the top of the handles to the bottom of the basket . i put 3 rolls of plastic wrap in the basket , and they fit fine . note that it is also wide deep enough that you will want to put something else in the basket besides the wrap , or they will flop around when you open the cabinet door . it 's a great basket for a great price ! 
the distance between the brackets is 6-3 8 '' and the depth of the bracket is 7 8 '' deep o.d . allow about 1 8 '' for the thickness of the bracket . hope this helps . 
no 
may be 4 or 5 , but it might get crushed in the bottom . 
my guess is it would , though i do n't have a dryer to test it . i use one to hold two spray bottles of cleaner and another hold two bottles of alcohol & # 128521 ; 
probably just under an inch 
i have used mine only 10 times and har had it for a few months but the cord rewind works like a champ . best stay out of the way of it or you might get whipped . 
this is actually pretty good at picking up my dalmatian 's hair . i 'm not sure what kind of dog you have , but for some reason , dalmations have hair that have a barb on them . makes it impossible to pick up , but this does a pretty good job picking up her hair . 
no . you can set it to bare floor height , which seems to be fine , in my experience 
yes ~ just the one filter . easy & quick to do . 
just shy of 25 ' 
it does a pretty good job . you have to use the attachments to get the edges and corners . 
yes , the best i have ever used . gw 
no ... i typically spend at least twenty minutes vacuuming each bare floor to try to make sure i got it all . 
there is a 3 year warranty on this product from bissell . it does not include belts , filters or brushes . the warranty also states it covers the vacuum for personal use but not commercial or rental properties . 
sorry to hear about the trouble with your hose , make sure the extension wand is removed from your hose and that the end of the hose is firmly pushed into the lower hose to tightly secure it . if you are still having trouble please reach out to us ! http : www.bissell.com contact-us ? cid=ccsocial2107 
hello , the pillow 's compartment will hold your ipad , but is not large enough for a laptop . it 's about 24cm x 32cm . thank you ! the privacy pillow team 
standard size . poly fill . 
sure . we will need your exact address if you would like a shipping cost estimate . thank you ! 
the pouch is made of leather , it seems like it 's genuine but i 'm not be sure 
works well on hard floors and on all carpets including area rugs . we have a dyson that we use for heavy cleaning and use our bissell for quick clean ups and under beds and cabinets , etc . 
yes , with both 
i do n't think it does . it just has a foam filter you can clean . 
i wonder why they do n't have an extension ? i am 5'6 and it is too short ... other than that it is fab ! 
we are not concerned about allergies in our home , but logic tells me that a bagless vac is much better than one that uses an old paper bag that leaks dust all over the place and gets full faster than we would like ! the bagless is contained , can be emptied outside the home , and then even rinsed out for next use ! love this vac ! we have hardwood floors in many rooms and it does a great job without scratches . hope this helps . 
hi holli , glad you asked about the filter ! its very important to wash the foam filters on this unit for optimal suction as well as periodically replacing the pleated pre and post motor filters . all for filters can be orders online directly from bissell : http : www.bissell.com hard-floor-expert-deluxe-canister-vacuum parts ? cid=ccsocial2107 
hi nancy- the retractable cord on mine measures 15 ft. ( not 20 ft as stated above ) i discovered this vacuum by accident and love it . i have mainly hardwood floors and this is perfect . works great on carpet too . cheers , tommy 
that is just one of the ridiculous things about this lousy product . that 's just the beginning . try using it ! ! if you can return it , i would do so and get your money back . 
i ordered some from the bissell site , but i would think you find them at an store that carries bissell . 
i have n't weighted it and i 'm sure there are spec 's somewhere that would tell you but i can say that it 's the lightest vacuum i 've ever used . the unit glides along the floor and the handle part is n't awkward to use . if i were to carry the unit in my hand , i 'd say its about 8 pounds . 
hello keri-ann , whether it be tile floor , long carpet or all of my different rugs , i have n't had any issues . this vacuum has easily been the best one i 've ever owned . for further review , check out the user guide ( http : www.bissell.com cleanview-complete-pet-with-onepass-technology ) . in the `` height adjustment '' section it states : there are five height settings available for various floor surfaces . turn the dial on the foot of the cleaner to the desired setting . * lowest setting - for low pile carpet or bare floors . to pick up debris , it may be necessary to move up one setting . * medium setting - for medium pile carpet . * highest setting - for high pile and most shag carpet . there is also a height setting in between the lowest setting and medium setting , along with another height adjustment between the medium setting and highest setting to make up the five height settings . 
cat hairs : terrific . i have two cats and it was able to get a bunch off from carpet about 3 hours after i had vacuumed with my old vacuum . best vacuum i have ever had for hairs . it does okay on my two rooms that have vinyl . one is my bathroom and it picks up all the litter around the litter pan . the brush attachment works well on hairs on furniture . there is nothing i dislike about this vacuum . the only drawback is that it is a little heavy , but it is still very easy to push . hopes this helps . 
all that i know is that i have three cats and one dog and this is the best picker upper i have ever had . i am not sure what is on the $ 80.00 vacuum , but i wanted this one . i also love the retractable cord . the filter is easy to clean and it rolls fairly easy for as heavy as it is . i will keep coming back to this one for sure . 
perfect for small house . plug stores in vacuum and also power brush turns on and off for carpet or bare floor . 
yes there is . 
the wand hose is not really long enough to do more than 8 steps . 
it is relatively lightweight ( 18lbs ) since it is largely made of plastic . but of course , an `` 8lb oreck xl '' weighs less than half as much . 
no . you might want to check out a wet dry vac for that . 
yes , you may want to use the extension wand on the hose as well but you should be able to easily vacuum under a bed ! 
the amperage is right under the description . it 's 12 amps and according to the formula watts = v x a then it is 1,440 watts . 
no , i believe the thermometer can only reach 300 degrees . it has a hard plastic face and might melt , as well . i do put it in the warmer ( 165 degrees ) to check temps and it does great . 
yes . 
you can not leave it in the oven . you 'll have to pull the roast forward , insert the thermometer , turn it on after insertion then remove and push the roast back into the oven . 
i have the same problem ! i do n't know what to do and i worry that it is no longer accurate 
mine works fine . 
yes , it will work for liquids . just as long as you do n't subject the display portion of the thermometer to liquid , you 're good to go . 
if you can , i would try to contact the kiserena people or amazon . if this happened right after purchase try amazon for an exchange . i think the best bet will probably be the manufacturer though . 
121mm 
what an interesting idea ! i have not done that , but i have used it to check temperature of the water in proofing yeast . i 've also do not start the temp display until the thermometer is inserted in the meat . ( faster that way ) . i think i 'll bake some bread this weekend to see how it performs . my tried-and-true method on yeast breads is the light-touch-on-top for rolls and tapping on crusty french bread while listening for a hollow sound . 
yes i think it can be used as a candle thermometer . it has the range of temperatures you would need . and it can be used in short or tall molds . 
i ordered this and the one i received was oval . 
a little bit , yes . it 's held up really well , actually , and that 's with everyday use with two kids and a cat on it , so i recommend it . 
it is folded . i 've had mine a few months and the folds have finally completely come out . looks great ! 
probably on top if room permits in your dish washer , but not on bottom since it is plastic or plastic-like material . however , we have always taken a minute to hand wash and wipe ours to store as soon as we finish using it . 
i have had no issues with it staining . 
i bought this pitcher mainly for my husband so we could cut out a lot of sugary sodas . we both really like it . the lid does n't fit too tight in fact i would suggest you hold maybe one finger lightly on the top as you pour . the reason for this we found is that the weight of the fruit in your infuser may sometimes make the lid tilt slightly . other than this , the pitcher size is really nice and very easy to fill and serve with . instructions say to wash by hand and i would agree because the heat of the dishwasher will eventually ruin it . we really like it and would recommend it to anyone looking for one . i hope this helps . 
i make mine in the evening for the next day 
tried loose tea leaves once . used cold water and let it sit overnight . the tea was very weak and there was a lot of sediment in the pitcher . i will not try again . 
hi joy ! this pitcher is ten inches tall and ls the greatest ! there are endless possibilitiesfor flavoring and the plastic is high quality durable . 
this attractive pitcher fits perfectly in my refrigerator door . one of my best purchases ! 
i use frozen fruit in the infusion tube and it lasts about a week ; however , if you have a house full of children using this daily , the fruit will only flavor the water so many times . yes , i have gotten a second and a third use from the fruit . each additional use of the fruit is a little weaker . 
no.. i just wash and cut to fit . love this . 
yes , i brew tea in boiling hot water and turn it into iced tea 
replacement filters are around $ 60- $ 70 and they last for one year . here 's the replacement filter listing on amazon : http : www.amazon.com brondell-hf-20-water-filter-replacement dp b00eedw3hw ref=sr_1_9 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1390586011 & sr=8-9 & keywords=brondell+h2o % 2b thanks ! 
there is no `` on off '' switch on this filter and the only way to control the water flow is by turning the switch on the faucet adapter on or off . yes , if someone forgets to switch the diverter off , then water will come out if the sink is turned on , however this is usually not an issue if the unit is near the sink with the spout pointed into the sink . alternatively , there is another model - the brondell cypress water filter system which does have a separate on off switch . you can see that product here : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00eedjses thanks ! 
it should . 
hi there , on the top of the pearl water filter system there is a circular window in the center of the top and if you look down there is a color indicator that changes when it 's time to replace the filter . filters last for one year with this system . thanks 
yes , the system comes with a filter cartridge which should last for the first year . replacements for the filter are easily available via amazon and through a variety of other retailers . thanks 
yes , the product comes with a filter . thanks ! 
the filter is good for one year and rated for 3200 gallons . the filter is certified for this life by the water quality association ( wqa ) so this is not just a manufacturers statement , but a certified statement that has been tested in a lab . thanks for asking !

i returned this filter because it did not work with my faucet 
filter works good . just have to make sure that you run the water thru the filter for 10 minutes initially not the 5 minutes stated in the packaging . when you buy a replacement filter it states 10 minutes . it does make a big difference . 
yes you can . the cover unzips easily and folds back 
two and half to three inches 
yes 
it fits 1 2 sheet pans as well . that is the size pans i have and two of them fit neatly on each rack . 
the cover was not sold separately 
horizontal x 2. holds 10 full or we do 14 half = 7 shelves . and 3 full = 3 shelves . 7+3= 10 total shelves . saves so much space . also we can proof and store with this . 
no it does n't . the `` bottom side '' of the cover is completely open . 
we considered a suction type of holder however suction only works on a perfectly smooth surface . so , with some help from 3m we created a very simple holder that uses a `` removable '' adhesive . the holder is virtually invisible when the squeegee is placed in it . thank you for considering cleret ! al 
not without difficulty . the handle is a curved piece of plastic with a cap on the end . the blade is removable but probably would be hard to find a handle to attach to clamp it in . try to contact the company directly to see if they have a product with a longer handle . or get a window squeegee or a small stepstool . 
it is 7 3 4 inches from the bottom of the blades to the end of the handle , measuring on the outside of the curve . the only thing i do n't like about this squeegee is that the handle is very slick , made out of a very slick plastic . 
ours kept falling off , so we just threw it away . it may be for using with a broom handle for a taller surface . works fine without it ! 
blaces for all models of cleret squeegees are available through the cleret website - cleret.com blades cost $ 2 each . double bladed sqeegees require 2 replacement blades ( unless only one needs replacing ) . 
looking from the end of the blades , they are curved . 
it is a shallow fry pan , not a sauce pan . i was able to fill it to the brim using 2 quarts plus 1 cup of water . 
it is a guide to the amount of oil poured in . the smaller circle is represents a puddle of about 5 cc 's of oil ( 37 calories ) and the larger circle is 15 cc 's of oil ( 111 cals ) . cc means cubic centimeter which equals a milliliter or about 0.202 teaspoons . 
i have natural gas stove -happy with it-as far as putting it in the oven i do not do that.the handle maybe a problem . 
the techef 11 '' lid . amazon has this item as well . ! note the lid comes unassembled . there are a grand total of 4 or 5 parts ( i am looking at mine and trying to remember if there is a washer involved . you 'll need a medium phillips head screwdriver . the lid has a really cool venting mechanism that directs the steam heat away from your hand . the heat resistant glass is mildly smoked in color and easy to see through . 
i have had good results with this pan on my single burner induction cook top . it is made of the correct material and the bottom is thick and the pan is heavy to allow for frying at the high temperatures generated by induction units . what problems have you experienced ?

the bottom of the pan is attracted to the stove magnetism . i 'm no engineer and i do n't know exactly how it works , but it does work . the bottom of the pan is not aluminum and it is specially built onto the pan . 
7.5 - 8 inches.= ~19 - 24 cm . those are the inside and outside dimensions of the structural ring on the bottom of the pan . the ferric plate that is inside the pan , and that provides the induction compatability is located within the aluminum cladding of the pan . 
i do n't know , as i use natural gas . i would suggest calling the manufacturer . if they say it will , then i can tell you techef is the best set of non-stick cookware i have ever used . i use it because it does n't require any oil or butter . omelets , fritattes , skinless chicken breasts , everything slides right out .

no . they do n't actually say where they are made but my instinct says 'china ' . 
i bought mine on a lightening deal last week and this is only the second time i 've seen it at this price . check the countdown timer . 
only the matress . i would n't mix the two anyway during a move . 
yes we sets of all of our eco mattress bags . we make over 15 sizes and each bag is 20 percent bigger making easier to slide and seal your mattress ! do n't stress about your mattress , we 've got you covered ! 
our eco mattress bag is 2.2 mil , non vented ( meaning no holes ) and is the thickest american made mattress wrap on the market . most bags are 1.8 and 2.0. we designed our bags at 2.2 to take the rigors of moving , storing and of course bed bug protection . please let us know if you have any additional questions ! thanks 
our eco mattress bags are best sealed with clear adhesive tape on the foot of the bed . most clear packing tapes work with our protective cover and scotch tends to be the best one to date ! 
i bought two . one for the mattress and one for the box spring . clear tape to ensure both are sealed good . 
it fit the queen size fine . if you are referring to a twin extra long i would check the length dimension carefully . if it is the same or shorter you will be ok . 
i used it for my pillow top matters and i had no problem . 
i have a 21 inch , so i ordered a king size , just to be safe . there was plenty of room , which made it easier to get the mattress in and out . 
the bag is clear 
hi bobby ! thanks for the question . my eco mattress bag is designed to protect your mattress from bed bug , mite , fleas , ticks and moth infestation . since they can not penetrate me eco mattress bag , as it 's designed as a non-vented 2.2 professional grade recycled plastic ( this is a huge factor ) , bed bugs and other small insects can not enter , break , chew through , burrow or nest like other mattress bags . other mattress bags are usually made with small venting holes which allow bed bugs easy access- which defeats the purpose of protection . our eco mattress bag is also made 15 % bigger so you can pull and seal tight to prevent any bed bugs from entering your mattress . for full protection , i would also suggest to wrap your box spring as bed bugs are commonly found infesting and reproducing in this area . i hope this is helpful and please let me know if you need anymore help ! sincerely green , spencer brown founder and inventor of the eco mattress bag 
these are basically just giant plastic bags . they are open on one side so i would recommend looking for something that closes if you want to store a mattress in the garage 
you definitely need two bags 
that 's a great question . we 're the first company in america to blend both recycled and oxo bio degradable additives to make our eco mattress protective cover . we take recycled films and shrink wrapped commonly found wrapping pallets of goods shipped to large super markets and retail centers and clean , polish and then chop and reform this into the base of the eco mattress bag . then we add a non toxic oxo bio component and form the bag . yesterday , we won the sustainable business council of los angeles green product and business of the year with our innovate and eco friendly solution to protecting your mattress ! thanks for a great question ! spence brown , founder and chief tree hugger , rent a green box and eco mattress bags ! 
eco mattress bags are sealed with tape and can also be repaired with clear tape if you tear , rip or need extra reinforcement for really old mattresses that have bolded on plastic corner caps . 
all of our eco mattress bags are made with 2.2 mil non vented professional grade recycled plastic . our eco bag is designed to be the toughest mattress protective cover made in america ! ! 
2.2 mil is .0022 thick in inches . another way is to take 6 garbage bags and stack them in one pile and that would be the same thickness . our eco mattress bag is a non crinkle and crackle bag that seals and protects your mattress from moisture , mildew and small insects . 
we use it for a similar-size sofa bed . it covers the central area of the bed and shields us from the crossbar that ends up about in the middle part of the back 
i believe it would . 
hello . this bed shield will roughly fit a 48 '' x 48 '' sized sofa bed . i hope this helps ! 
plastic which looks like a sheet of cardboard but very strong 
yes , it folds up . 
they are clear . from a few feet away its actually hard to tell the difference between these and our actual glass version . we have these for outdoor ... . 
yes - all the same size . 
no they do not sweat . 
they are large , probably around 18 oz or so ... 
that depends entirely on the size of the cup holder . 
18 ounces 
just over a pint to the brim so about 22ozs 
there are at my daughter 's house , but from my observation they do not cloud up - certainly not as much as another brand we own . 
they are bigger than 10 oz , not sure exactly , at least 14 oz . 
yes 
no . thick plastic . 
total height is 9 '' 
yes . clear and colorless 
i purchased these as a gift , so i do not know the exact oz size , however , i can tell you that they were a standard champagne glass size . they looked really nice and not at all like plastic . 
i gave them as a gift so i 'm not certain but they looked like a standard restaurant size . 
the glasses are made of tritan which is a product of eastman chemical company . it is listed as bpa free and i recommend searching eastman tritan to find their product info page for further details . 
yes i did test this system with the tds meter and was very disappointed . the readings were exactly the same as what came out of the tap . i called brondell and they informed me that was how it 's supposed to be . their system is apparently designed to only remove the bad taste ... not the dissolved solids ... well in my case it did neither . the water still tasted bad and the tds reading was just as high as the tap . our water is so bad here , typical readings from 450-800+ so it may just be that filters do n't work here . i gave up on filters after trying many and ordered delivered water from culligan . 
no scientific evidence about that . but it definitely changes the taste of nappy-texas water . 
it comes with all the filters you need . it says they will last for 6 months . then i believe you will have to order the replacements . 
i live in an area where water is very hard . the filter does n't remove the calcium . i can see that while boiling the filtered water ; have to clean the boiler every day if i do n't want to have any sediment in my tea . i find the berkey filter more effective . 
interesting question . i wanted to know so ... let 's say your unit costs 180 . 2 of the filters are good for 6 months ( hf-31 , hf-33 ) , and 1 filter is good for a year ( hf-32 ) . from page 5 of the manual , `` the period for filter exchange is based on 0.5 gallons average use per day '' . so , i believe cost per gallon for the first 6 months would then be .5gal day*180 days = 90 gallons @ 180 , in which case your price per gallon is 2 bucks . your costs would go down from there since you wont have to factor in your one-time equipment cost , just the filter replacement cost . 
i found this at their web site : the current line of h2o+ water filtration systems are specifically designed not to remove fluoride . fluoride is a mineral that promotes dental health and has other beneficial qualities when in small quantities , as found in most municipal water systems . however , we realize that some people still want to remove fluoride from their water and are working on additional models to meet this need . go to http : brondell.com water-filter-faq for more details . other than that , it is good for apartments where you can not drill a hole in the counter top to get a reverse osmosis , or i would have gotten a reverse osmosis . 
no 
no . 
im not sure how tall your keurig reservoir is but i have my unit next to my sink with the spout hanging over the edge . this affords me enough room to fill just about anything and any water that isnt caught in what im filling simply drops into the sink.. but over a counter i would estimate the spout is about 7 to 8 inches above the countertop . 
plate and stand pillar dimensions are as follows : - ( 2 ) 6 inches plates ( 4 ) 8 inches plates ( 4 ) 10 '' plates ( 4 ) 12 '' plates ( 1 ) 14 '' plate ( 2 ) 5 inch stands pillars ( 2 ) 10 `` stands pillars ( 2 ) 15 '' stands pillars ( 1 ) 20 inch stands pillar 
yep , everything comes in parts , meaning the tiers and pillars can be arranged any way you want.. i only use a couple at a time actually.. 
the styrofoam is just a prop , i will be using the stands for cupcakes as well . 
you can add to your cart when you place an order . the cost of the fountain is $ 36.95 plus shipping . irene 
they are all different sizes with no edge to the stand so you can out whatever shape you want on the stand 
no , the order just comes with the stands . 
not at all..when we finished using them i even washed them..they are reusable 
i do n't make cup cakes just cakes but if i had to take a guess , 80-100 cup cakes 
i do n't remember the exact dimensions but it was pretty big . maybe 3'x2'x1 ' ... they laid flat with the poles packed on top . 
yes 
big enough to make 2 extra long twin beds into one california king 
not sure of exact length but it fits comfortably around two twin mattresses to make a king sized mattress . 
the strap is approximately 1 1 2 '' and it has a metal buckle , works great 
i would think so since it is adjustable . you can sinch it up as snug as you want . 
we live in a really old house so the door way to the second level would only allow for a full size mattress and we had to get a custom split full size box spring . a full size is simply to small- we purchased a low profile king frame and put the bed together on that level and two twin x-l mattresses and box frame . we used this strap plus the foam joiner and it works great ! 
the straps are much longer than needed . i put two twin xl ( not adjustable ) together and used about half the strap . 
we only used it for two twin mattresses and it worked great . since two straps could be hooked together , i would imagine that you could use the two straps to get enough length to go around two mattresses of differing sizes . 
if you want to adjust after the srg belt is on , you will probably have to take it off , adjust the beds , and refasten it . 
the beds are even . with a good quality mattress pad , you would n't know that they are not one . 
it is sufficient to hold the twin beds together . we still use a bridge to fill in that little gap . 
the top is 6 '' ( then it 's 8 '' , 10 '' , 12 '' ) 
yes all tiers are separate and the bases are interchangeable also 
plastic 
never i recivied this product . 
as a guide the styrofoam i a big help 
no . sorry you cant stack in descend order because the bottom plate for the largest cake is not attachable to the poles it has its own small marble sized feet for sitting low on the table . further mo re if you look at the pieces they all have plates on the top and bottom of each support pole but the bottom plate only has 1 plate and there is no interlocking feature on the center f it to mount it to the pole . even if you could the cakes are way way to heavy to be that high . 
the size is approximately 23 '' x 23 '' x 10 '' 
hi jeannine , the number of slices depends on how tall your cakes are if they are as shown ( where they over lap each other ) it can easily feed 150 people ! we had 35 guests show up so we had cake fir months because i wanted a big cake for presentation . this also includes saving the top tier for the wedding couple : ) 
about an inch and a half is the width of the tube itself they are all the same thickness and interchangeable they just come in different lengths as shown to make the tiers cascade : ) 
well , i 'm not the strongest person around , and i think it works easily . if the clove is very large it takes more strength to squeeze it than if the clove is small . you could always cut the clove in half to make it even easier . 
what a good question ! i looked closer at the handles and they appear to be sealed . i have never had water get trapped in them . however , i have never left them submerged in a sink of water either . they are so easy to clean , that just a quick swish under the faucet has always been enough . i have not put them through a dish washer either . they are so easy to rinse clean , that it just seems like an unneccesary waste of space to put them in there . 
ehm ... yes . there are no sharp edges . 
i have the kuhn and the problem i have with it is that i have pinched my hand several times . i am now more careful in how i use is it , so i have n't the problem in awhile . however , it is the only garlic press i have ever owned that caused me to get pinched . i bought it because it was stainless and had good reviews . other than the pinched skin it has been a good choice . 
yes it does work on ginger . just put a piece in , squeeze , and voila . i eat more garlic and ginger because of this crusher and that makes me happy : ) 
i 'm pretty sure it 's solid 
this garlic press is great . best i have ever had . 
yes 
yes 
it actually looks exactly like the picture . my daughter loves it . the colors are rich . 
i purchased this reversible comfortable as a gift but the material did n't feel slippery , i think it would stay put . 
they are reversible in full size . 
it fits an ipad well and it measures 5-1 2 '' x 5-1 2 '' , nothing larger . do not have a kindle paperwhite . 
it does not hold an ipad air securely because the ipad air is so thin . 
thank you for your question regarding the gogo pillow . we are sorry to hear that it does n't fit the samsung 7 '' tablet . unfortunately , this is the only size that we carry . if you have ordered this product from us , and it does n't fit , we 'll be happy to offer you a full refund . philip 
ana : thank you for your question . at the moment , we offer this pillow in both gray and burgundy . scott 
yes 
yes , stuffing is mainly microbeads , though is also partially stuffed with the other part of the pillowcase ; the part where it turns into a neck pillow

yes it does , i am typing on my ipad mini that is on a gogo pillow right now ! it will hold an ipad mini or a regular ipad and a kindle fire , i have all of those . 
hi ! i use 2 large lipton tea bags . it depends on how strong you like your tea . 
no . it is just a plastic pitcher with a removable strainer . you fill it partially with hot water , let it brew , then add cold water ice to quickly cool it down quickly . 
there is no number , however it says it is bpa free 
i let my tea brew for 2hours , take out teabags then refrigerate or serve . it gets bitter if you let it set out overnight . 
no . the water must be boiled separately in a pot on the stove or in an electric or regular kettle . 
absolutely ! just fill the inner net tube ( do n't know name ) with 10 tea bags whatever flavor and pour the hot water to correct line , let steep , add cubes , done 
i had a similar problem when i bought mine - my experience with my new purchase has been terrific - after pricing other toppers i figured that even if it had n't worked , i would be out less money - very pleased with mine , my back is very thankful ! 
i read other reviews that it was hot but i personally have not experienced any heat from this topper . 
yes . 
yes 
full size- these fit well 
it is true to size . fit my mattress perfectly with a little extra 
yes 
well , measuring it would be like measuring a cloud . it is about an inch or so , perhaps a bit more . but it compresses , of course . we are happy with it in our rv . does as we needed . 
it fit over my kids regular twin mattress . i do n't know about a thinner mat type bedding . 
the probability is that it will . because of the thickness it provides a pillowy feel . 
no it is not waterproof . however , i put another mattress pad on top of it to keep it from getting wet as mine does not wet the bed but takes drinks to his bedroom and sometimes spills them on the bed . it is still very soft and he does n't seem to notice the extra covering but it would probably be even more luxurious with the extra mattress pad . hope this helps . 
i would think it would certainly add quite a bit of softness . however , it feels like jell foam pockets and it probably would n't fill up where it dips down and make it level . it would have to be an improvement as it was a big improvement on an old mattress . 
yes , it will go under a mattress pad fairly easily . also , it does n't make me feel any warmer or hot ... it is so soft , i love mine . i highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a softer mattress . and it is keeping it shape nicely . kristine harmonyinohio 
no , i do n't believe so . it 's more like a down alternative feel similar to feathers . very soft but no gel bead or foaminess feel . 
my guess would be ' no ' - it 's a fitted mattress cover so it might not lay neatly on top of a cot unless your cot is a standard bed size or you want to cut off the fitted sides . 
couple of inches it fits standard king sheets still 
yes 
typically a twin xl is 5 inches longer than a twin . i think you 'd find yourself fighting an uphill battle . a full size has the length but the width almost 15inches wider . there are several similar products that had an xl available in the same price range , luckily . 
it is the type of filling within the pockets the mattress topper has . honestly , i do n't think it feels what you would think something `` gel-filled '' would feel like . if i had to compare it to anything , it would be a down comforter insert ( the ones for duvets ) except a little more plush . hope that helps . 
i do n't think so -- the pockets on mine were perfect . i would contact them . 
i put this cover on my child 's mattress , because he has a cheaper mattress , however , he has had trouble laying down for his nap , and staying in bed , so lately , i 'll lay down next to him for a while till he gets sleepy . once or twice i 've fallen asleep , and no it did n't get hot or even warm . it was very comfortable . but i have n't slept on it for an extended period of time . sorry about the lengthy answer . 
not that i noticed ... super soft : ) 
my review should have said not overly hot ... .not overly `` horrible '' . auto correct sucks ! 
did n't see anything on the package about water-proof . its very soft and worth the money . i have a king . 
very ! 
i checked all of the packaging and tags , and did not see anything to indicate that it does . however , i 'm not sure if they are required to label that or not . you may need to contact the company directly to know absolutely . 
i 'm sorry . have n't had it long enough to know . 
this one doesnt claim gell filled ? this is down alternative . the gell filled is more like memory foam type so if your looking for more of a memoery foam feel go gell if you want a pillow top feel fo this one . 
it is equivalent to folding up a quilt . 
i only used cold water for a quick wash and did n't dry , just fluff cycle . worked well . 
people braver than me have experimented with & succeeded in using ziplock ( thin plastic ) type bags on the vacuum sealers , but one such person said he would n't do it on a new machine , suggested getting one cheap from a garage sale , goodwill , etc . do a youtube search on the topic to get more specific details . the quality of any sandwich is going to suffer after being frozen . good quality bread freezes well . any ingredients with a high water content that 's in the sandwiches may ooze water when defrosted & cause the bread to be mushy . 
it comes with two rolls of the small and two of the large . i really love this vacuum sealer . we grow all of our own fruits and vegetables , so this is really nice to have . 
there is an accessory that allows you to vacuum seal jars . i bought it but have not used it yet . however , if it works as well as the rest of the unit and accessories , it should be fine . 
the bags are not pre cut so you can make any size bag . we use this vacuum sealer for freezing meats and fish . i am very happy with it . very easy to use . 
i only use about 1-1 2 inches of empty bag , it depends a lot on how thick your food is . i have not seen any precut bags from cuisinart or any other brand so far . but i like making my own . why use someone else s dimensions when i can make exactly what i need . so far i am very happy with cuisinart vacuum sealer . 
the weight of the chicken should n't be an issue . maximum bag width is 11 '' and those bags can be stuffed about 4 in . tall , so if you can arrange your 10 lbs . into a somewhat smaller space , allowing room for air to be sucked out along the top and sides and all the way to the back of the bag , it should work fine . 
i have not found it to be so . it may be but i did not want to force it . i just wipe it out carefully and it seems to work . 
four rolls came with our vacuum sealer ( two of each width ) i am not sure of the lengths or widths but they seem sufficient in size

it depends on your expectations and layout in your home . i have all tile floors and pets . the robot keeps the dirt down but resevoir must be emptied daily . i also found that dirt collects on the filter and needs to be cleaned out with a brush every day . i operate the robot with a programmed schedule . i have noticed the robot tends to get stuck between chairs or under the bed . also , it wo n't eliminate the need for supplemental vaccuming or sweeping . 
i ca n't find any support and you will not find any accessories either like the virtual wall.. 
the shag would `` kill '' the thing . 
i never had roomba or any other remote vacuum so i ca n't answer that part . this one does n't give as many errors but you really really need to empty the space of wires , thin doormats or rugs otherwise you need to babysit it . it does its job though . keep cleaning all the hair regularly and keep it away from water . i am satisfied with their after-sale service . my hovo 510 needed repair within 2 months ( i had bought a second hand from amazon ) and they asked us to parcel it and they sent it back in very few days . i also did n't want to spend 300+ so bought mine for less than 200 and can say i 'm fine with it . just once a week i take my standing vacuum and clean the corners . 
first of all , sorry for responding so late . it is clearly mentioned in the instructions that it should not be run on water or liquid . it will have problem and might stop working . 
input 100-240v 50 60 hz 
this one is just a vaccuum , it does n't mop . the sanetizer is a light 
the machine should pick up animal hair with no problems . it can not traverse stairs , so you would have to move it yourself . 
it has a sensor that stops it when something gets stuck in the roller bar . so if its a high thick carpet then it has a hard time turning and shuts itself off . mine usually stops if it gets an envelope or a zip lock bag stuck in it . ha ha . we have one thick throw that it stops on also . 
nope . hopefully your cat is agile enough to run away ! ! 
the depth of the pan is about 4.25 , with the lid is measures around 7.5. those are my rough measurements . the 5.6 must refer to the dimensions of the box . 
the information that came with the pan says not to wash it in the dishwasher . cleanup is so easy though with soap and hot water . nothing sticks to it . i really like this brand . 
4 inch ... ... pan is 11 inch wide 
dear paula , thank you for your inquiry . the measurements you requested are approximately 11 inches . thank you for allowing us to service you . tonia d. consumer relations . 
four inches . i like the pan . the bottom is not as heavy as i would like , but i have not had any problems with uneven heating . the size has enabled me to cook a larger volume of things than i could with the other pans i own . i made a pot roast in it and used two fairly large pieces of beef . i bought a number of these pans because i really liked the 8 inch egg omelet pan of theirs . it has a nice heavy bottom and heats very evenly . unfortunately , the larger pans are not proportionally heavier . i am still happy with them but might have looked at something else if i had known before i ordered them . 
paula , was a bit hard , since the pan inside , curves up the sides but best as i could measure without worrying of scratching , it is 8 1 2 inches flat surface . on outside bottom pan it is 8 3 4 inches . 
margaret , you can also put it in the dishwasher . works just fine . ... deb at hc essentials 
absolutely not . any damage to the mat , it should be discarded , according to the manufacturer . fire issue maybe ? i 'd just buy a new pan to fit the mat . 
i 'm sure it has a 30 day money back guarantee , but you wo n't need it . the mat works really well ! 
this will expose the edges of fiberglass and even though they cut a silpat in this : http : jetcitygastrophysics.com 2011 04 28 modernist-cuisine-at-home-mushroom-omelet i would n't recommend it unless you repaint coat the edges . 
whether you like it or not , it 's a global economy . and i know this vendor ... they are usa born and bred , and their offices are in colorado . 
very good..we cook pizza at 250c the maximum temp of our oven 
the silicone baking mats are made in china to the highest quality specs and are fda approved . the owner of hanson creek personally traveled to china to inspect the silicone baking mat . thank you for your question- the hanson creek team 
no 
heavy plastic 
you must use anchors designed for plaster - like tapcon or others . product comes with self drilling drywall anchors and screws 
that is already factored in - this is the discount off single units 
this is discount off single unit pricing 
yes it is returnable but buyer is responsible for freight charges 
i ordered these a few weeks ago and i received 5 expandable shelves 
snaps . all along the hard plastic top and handle . no , there are small gaps between snaps in which i would think liquid would leak through . it does not seal like a ziploc bag . 
it 's a snap close 
it is quite large , they call it jumbo size . the length is about 19 inches and the width is about 20 inches . it is very roomy inside . 
yes.. probably a 16 '' pizza at least.. its a big bag 
they will still be cold if it is closed and in a decent temperature ( in the car or bus ) , but they would not be frozen . it guarantees frozen things up to 3 hours . 
it can easily hold 3 large boxes of frozen food from sam 's club and 10-12 standard size frozen items from the grocery store . you can get a great deal in each bag . 
the large jumbo is 20x20x7in . the dimensions are on the bottom of the product picture . 
i 'm not sure what you mean by sharp corners . it attaches with very strong glue to the corner . it 's pretty permanent , but that 's ok with me . just be sure you get it at the height you want it prior to glueing ! i have mine about 3 feet off the floor of the shower and it 's perfect . 
hi diane , thank you for your query . no , the adhesive will not damage your tiles and can be removed using warm water and a scraper . also it will not damage marble tiles . elevease comes with simple instructions and once followed will not in any way damage your shower environment . kind regards dave 
i stuck it to ceramic tile . so i really ca n't answer your question . 
i think it would end up being pretty ugly because the adhesive would be left behind . i do n't know how much you could scrap off with a putty knife . 
yes 
i 'm sorry , i did n't install mine . it is huge for my area and i can not return it because the epoxy that is included classify it as `` hazardous waste '' . sorry i could be more help . 
elevease is designed to fit into the corner of a shower unit to enable the adhesive to stick on to the shower walls . unless you have these angles i would not recommend elevease to you . regards dave 
hi , thank you for your enquiry . when elevease is positioned at knee height as per the instructions , your body weight automatically transfers to your other leg . this means that elevease becomes a foot rest . heavy amounts of weight on the product is not recommended . use in this manner and elevease will not move . regards dave 
i do not know about either of these as i do not have acrylic and have not removed . the adhesive is separate and i would image that if you were concerned you could probably find a known safe bet at home depot . also , the adhesive does not smell like it would be the type that would eat into acrylic . the step is very good , however . 
i do not know . the comforter might be short for an extra long bed , however it is long on my std . twin bed . if you have an xl twin bed , i do n't believe they are not that much longer than a std . twin- 5 '' maybe ? . i would still use it for the price . 
not sure why it says set ... later on in the description it does say it only includes the comforter ... and that 's all we got ... just the comforter . we are happy with it . it 's lightweight ... we added a duvet cover as it was for my 12 year old ... and i did n't want to be washing it all the time . 
i would say it is light to medium . we live in virginia and even in the winter i think this is going to do just fine . it 's not heavy but not light either . my son is actually sleeping on top of it right now and covering up with a light blanket and it 's the beginning of september . he 's a really hot natured kid though . hope this helps . 
mine is to size 68 x 90. extra large size 
it would fall over the sides which is nice and cosy but it will not fit any single duvet comforter cover . 
yes ! it is ! 
no , it does n't have anything like that . i actually would n't recommend this product at all . 
it is full , but you have to know it is polymer 
do n't know . sorry that i am not more helpful . 
dorothy , this is in one of my guest room that has n't been used since we remodeled it so i have n't had to launder it yet but , i always take comforters to the dry cleaner . 
according to instruction manual there is a 3 yr factory warranty i have had a new one that lasted for 10 yrs with everyday use and a rebuilt one that lasted around 5 yrs . hope this helps 
its like a fan on low but works awesome its our second one the first one lasted 22 years 
we did not keep this air purifier . we have a living air clasic xl15 . we wash the filters for our purifier but i do n't know about the alpine air . 
first of all , let me tell you we did not keep this unit-it produced too much ozone for us and it was really noisy . we already had a living air classic xl15 and we decided since we liked it so much and it did such a good job , we would have it repaired . the unit is 8 '' wide x 11.75 '' high x 9.75 '' deep . i do know that the filter on our unit is washable . hope this helps . 
the woven cord on the included probe is 45 '' long . the cord on the optional `` thin '' probe is 50 '' . 
you can close the oven door on the cable with no problem . you ca n't leave the monitor in the oven . btw , the monitor has a magnet on the back so i put it on my refrigerator while i have the probe in the oven . you could also stick on the side of the oven . 
yes 
it takes two aaa batteries . the worst part of changing them is that the magnet that will hold the thermometer to the grill is right next to the phillips screw that fastens the battery door- a magnetized screwdriver can easily push away ; a non-magnetized driver will easily be drawn onto the magnet . no big deal , just something to be aware of ! 
i used it on a london broil in the oven and the barbeque and got excellent results . as specefied in the directions ; you need to use a little care to route the cable away from open flames . 
should work fine . 
no 
it comes in a very nice zipper case , with probe and instruction manual . 
there are only temperatures . you can look up temperatures for rare , medium , etc . for a specific meat on the internet or in almost any cookbook . the thermometer also measures liquid temperatures . 
i would n't put them in the dishwasher , but yeah , they are washable . the cable is covered in stainless steel braid , and the probe looks to be stainless steel as well . no worries . 
yes it will . the high-temp probe can be inserted into the bird and left in during the cooking process . the cable and probe junction is sealed , and the cable itself will withstand short term exposure up to 700f . plenty of room when frying at 300f . 
a brief look on their website found this ... http : www.thermoworks.com pdf thermoworks_warranty.pdf 
erica , the probe has a long , very thin , flexible cable that is connected to the timer monitor device . you stick the probe into the item being cooked , put it in the oven , probe attached , with the cable coming out the oven door , connected to the timer which will sit on a shelf or counter near or oven , or can attach to the oven , etc . by magnet on the unit 's back . so you do n't have to keep opening the oven door , etc . to check temperature while cooking . 
47 inches 
if you go to the thermoworks website you can buy a probe specially-made for doing air temps . it includes a little bracket to help you attach it to a grill . it 's less than $ 20 . i 'm thinking of getting one to test the temp of my oven . hope that helps , joe 
the probe wire is about 45 inches long . it has the plug on one end to insert into the unit . the probe itself is about 8 inches long and bent to a 90 degree angle . i have had no problem with having the probe in the oven and the unit on the counter . hope this helps . 
the chefalarm will work great for frying . you can use the included stainless steel pot clip to position the probe into the oil . the pro-series probes have a range up to 572 degrees f which should easily accommodate frying temperatures . the cable on the high-temp cooking probe can withstand temps up to 700f . 
on mine it flashes if you are below that temperature . it beeps too , but if you press a button it stops making noise and continues to blink . it should stop flashing if you drop the low temperature below the current cooking temp and the high temp above . if you never use the low alarm just set the low temp as low as it can go . 
i have n't had mine that long but i purchased mine to use in making cheese . i have used it three times to make cheese and i have left it in milk until my mixture comes to temp . the directions tell you not to place it on the bottom of the pot . i love it . 
it only has one temp probe input , so if you only wanted to monitor the oven , then yes . if you wanted to monitor your food and the oven temp , you would need a monitor with dual inputs . there might be better temp probes for the job though ( check the thermoworks website for options ) , the needle probe is not ideally suited for measuring air temp , but it does do the job . 
yes 
2 aaa 
it will work great for bread . simply insert the probe to the center of your loaf and set the high alarm to your target temperature . 
yes rob . 
no it has plates that you can clean 
if the ozone filters are new then low . turn it up as they age ( about 6 months ) 
24 7 
yes if the air is to strong turn down 
i did n't receive the one that i ordered from amazon . i was told it was on it 's way , then damaged in shipment . the seller said he was out of stock so would n't send a replacement but , when i checked his total he was still showing inventory . so , i ordered mine from ebay . i would buy another one , the ones i 've had in the past were around $ 500.00 and this one does the same thing . 
warranty on this product ? 
yes , it has a pot clip . initially , i could n't figure out how to use the clip and here 's the secret . pinch the clip together near the probe holes . guide your probe through the holes to the length you want , then release . the probe is now locked into the clip until you release it . easy ! 
i 'm not sure what their official stance would be , but i would say `` yes . '' the probe they package with the chefalarm is rated to 572f , and short-term exposure all the way up to 700f . i 've certainly never had any issues with probe failures that seemed to be secondary to heat ( at least , not with thermoworks probes ) . having said that , i usually recommend purchasing a second replacement probe just in case ; repeated kinking at high temps *can* cause issues even with the best probes , and it can be really annoying to be stuck without a usable probe at the wrong moment . 
the range is between -58 to 572 degrees f ( -50 to 300 degrees c ) accordingly to specs but the operating range is 32 to 122 degrees f ( 0 to 50 degrees c ) . 
there are instructions that come with it . a small booklet but it explains everything . 
yes it does . 
the probe is six inches long on the straight part with another 1 2 inch when the 90 degree bend is included . 
47 inches 
47 inches 
according to my slap-dash measurements , 44 inches . the probe is an additional 6 inches . 
extremely . we have the instant read thermopen ( husbands absolute favorite ) and this . he uses this for oven grill for large pieces of meat . we have actually given these both as gifts . everyone loves them . if you watch any of the grilling shows or check reputable cookbooks , thermoworks is their choice . good luck . 
yes it does 
i have had my thermoworks outlive two sir la table probe thermometers and there replacements . in fact the replacements need replacing now . they are cheaper and sir la table replaces them at no cost , but i do have to go get them replaced and of course that policy does no good when they do n't work and you are about to start cooking . in short yes . 
you can measure for both - but make sure the sensor tip does n't touch metal . 
the chef alarm works great with sauces , just as long as you keep the tip off the bottom of the cooking vessel ( it should be suspended in the middle of the mass ) . also , you should n't be putting electronics in the dish washer ( including the probe ) . ; ) 
yes , it can be used with a smoker . i have used mine several times to measure temps towards the end of a cook , and no issues . 
the flexible part is about 44 '' , so overall just about 4 feet from plug to tip of probe . i believe you can order additional or replacement probes with longer cords if needed , but this length is more than sufficient for our ovens at home . 
i have n't found it to be a problem . you have to be careful to close the oven door so as not to break or bend the wire . 
no . measures food temperature only , however , i am personally satisfied with its purchase ; and i have used it thirty times or more , a conservative guess , in the short time i 've owned it . 
yes . it has both a high and a low temperature alarm . 
yes . 
yes , at the tip of the probe , just the narrower , pointed 3 4 in . or so . 
yes it comes with a clip to attach to top of pan . must protect cable from burner heat , ie keep away from flame . 
designed in utah . assembled in china . 
i think it 's rated for 700 degrees . but these things are n't indestructible . mine has n't broken but i would n't want to expose it to super high heat . will they work on the grill ? yes . but be careful . i 've used it on my grill for steaks . if i was going to use it mostly for grilling , i would get the thermapen . smoking on the other hand , you want this . 
it does not have a clock but has a timer . 
they are about 3 inches by 1 1 2 inches . i used them at my daughters wedding . they are great . 
no , i use styrofoam . 
yes they have lids . as for the second question i 'm not sure what you are asking . they fit well in the existing holder and i used them for `` dirt cake '' and they worked great 
no - they are smaller and cuter . 
i would imagine not . they are hard plastic . 
when i make jell-o shots in these i put a small amount in first and let them cool in the stand in the refrigerator then bring them back out and fill . you can also alternate colors that way they seem to not leak if you start with just a small portion . 
hi lara . there are 100 mini push-pops . 100 lids . 100 pops . 100 sticks . 
they are great but you need to pipe in the fillings . that way the edges stay clean 
honestly , we did n't try to put liquids in them . i think it might because the push part is tight and it holds suction . i think they might leak after a while though , but if it was gon na be holding the liquids for a short period of time , i believe it would work well . 
yes they do 
plastic . 
we 've never had an issue w that ? we use the soap mix up too fast to see any of that . i once had a leaky container for the soap mix . it leaked a lot , but again , that was never an problem for us . but if it happen 's , i 'd wash out really well , and try using it again , or try a different type . 
i have n't tried that but i would assume it would work as long as you water it down . i 'm assuming you 're talking about regular dish soap and not actual dishwashing machine liquid . i have put watered down dish liquid in a different foam dispenser and it worked so i would assume it would work in this one just fine also . 
i only use it with dishwashing soap and it works fine . 
i have not . but , i am using dr. bronner 's pure castile soap - lavender . i would like to know the answer as well since i like to add essential oils to my soap . 
mine does not stick , in use for months now . 
sorry julie i don`t know but if you don`t eat or drink from containers that contain bpa you can`t be hurt . 
yes ... add no water if you use pre-mixed foaming soap 
i do n't know , but you can put your desired number of dispensers in the shopping cart , go through checkout until the next-to-last step , and see the shipping cost before clicking on `` order . '' if the total shipping cost is too high , i would empty the cart , google the product , and look elsewhere for a better deal . 
it 's around 8 ''

the chair reclines almost flat and can be locked into different positions with the tightening knob on the side . 
yes , there is a knob on the side the tighten the back reclining feature . 
no the ottoman is a fixed height matching that of the chair . 
the chair is exceptionally stable . my 83 year old mother in law sits in it all day without a problem . the bottom base is very wide . 
no , it does not . 
no 
no the height can not be changed . 
there are a few different colors in leather . item numbers : bt-7862-bk-gg bt-7862-bn-gg bt-7862-burg-gg bt-7862-cream-gg 
i do n't really know but what i know for sure is that it can hold at least 300lbs . 
i think they would be fine , with stabilizer of course . they are n't textured so the embroidery will be even . 
after being washed and hung to dry mine are 15 '' x24 '' . 
these towels originate in bangladesh as do most linens in the market today . ... doug keeble outlets 
bangladesh , and yes they are a herringbone weave , which helps with water absorption . ... doug keeble outlets 
after i washed them they measured 13.5 '' x 22 '' 
these would make great large napkins . love these dishcloths and plan to purchase more . 
sorry william , but we have never run a promotion like the one you are referring to . we did have a 50 % off promotion when this product was launched back in august , but that was only for the first week . ... doug keeble outlets 
we only have the blue stripe towels at this time . however these stripes are near the outer edges of the towels if that helps . ... doug keeble outlets 
there are six towels in the package . 
no 
mine has started doing the same thing , only it worked really well for a few months . i think it 's because i wiped the inner circle on the bottom , which the instructions say not to do . i did it lightly , because i want it clean , but apparently , this ruins the unit ! very frustrating because now i have to buy a new one ! 
hello , the air mist is at room temperature , not cool nor warm . 
yes . the light is a separate button . we run ours at night with the light off . love it ! ! 
it will be fine for your bedroom . i am using in my living room which is 10x16 . 
distilled white vinegar works wonders for cleaning . be careful when cleaning the ionizer area . 
it 's not like an oven timer . you just turn it on and it runs for 2 hours then shuts off . 
what you do is just put a few drops in the water . 
it does n't specify . i was concerned as well about that . i doubt it though because it seems like a really cheap product . lightweight $ 20 cheap item , although it 's $ 60 . i would n't recommend . 
no ! super quiet . i have a vicks humidifier that is so noisy . with this one you can barely tell it 's on . 
in the description it says it is bpa free . 
nothing on the packaging about oven temp . i made muffins and baked at 375 degrees . they worked great . easy to hand wash -- put a drop of dish soap and just rub them between your hands , and rinse . my other silicone stuff goes up to 400 degrees , but i 've never used any of at that high a temp . 
thank you for your question and `` no baking pan is needed to support '' when you baked with silicone baking cups from pacific-v , you can just put them on a baking sheet and it good to go . thanks again ! 
thanks for the question , it made in china ! 
ty , just measured ... bottom is 1 3 4 inches , top is 2 3 4 inches . standard muffin cupcake size ... hope it helps ! 
i have not used mine in a toaster oven but i goggled it and someone had used theirs in the toaster oven with good results . 
if you are going to use them for food ( either baking or food portioning ) , then it would probably be a good idea to wash them first . i bought mine to make soap in , so i just gave them a quick rinse in warm water before using them for the first time . 
to the top , 1.5 oz . 
hi debra , our baking cups is size 7cm on the top , 4.5cm bottom and 3.5cm height ! it consider not the mini size , thanks . 
they are odor free - at least so far ! i love them . 
it does not have a light to indicate when it needs to be cleaned , but it 's really easy to open and get the filter out . it does help with pet dander ... we have a bulldog and she sheds like crazy ... this machine picks up the smallest of junk in the air . we live in texas and it 's naturally dusty & lt ; i have to dust at least 3 times a week because of my husband 's allergies - but with this on - i 'm down to once a week yay ! & gt ; . my husband had severe allergies and was sneezing at least 25 times a day ... .i have n't heard him in over a week & lt ; the last time i cleaned the filter & gt ; . i know when it 's time to clean the filter because his eyes water and he sneezes a lot . this has 3 speeds . quick clean , reguar , and whisper clean . i use quick clean after i change the filter and let it run for 30-45 minutes , then i change it to regular for 2-3 days , and then i run it on whisper clean the rest of the time . if it gets really dusty , like when we do yard work & lt ; the dust always gets in the house & gt ; , or we cook fish or something that really stinks - i change it to quick clean . you 'll be able to figure out a routine that works best for you . i hope his helps ! 
no , it only has a paper filter that you vacuum and reuse . for its size , it does a nice job . no replacement filter needed . i use it in my 10 x 11 home office which always has visitation from our cat and dog . ( i am allergic to the cat and it keeps the air filtered ) . i truly notice the difference . 
we have had one for years and love it , but it works slowly to clean the air in a small room over time and does a great job at controlling normal dust and dander - - - if you mean while you are scooping or pouring litter , this unit is less than ideal for clouds of dust . 
while i 'm not a smoker , my son is . it will take a minute or two to clear the air , but the tobacco smell will shortly go away . as noted in my review i 'm very pleased with the hb and suggest adding the 3m filtrete to the installed filter if you have allergy problems . for the money , the hb is a very good buy ! i hope this helps you . 
do reduce it by a fair amount but not all . 
it helped with musty smells and even helped with paint and harsh chemical smells 
no this model uses hepa filter . 
i have no idea about the cadr and merv rating . i sent this over to my son in afghanistan as the dust was so bad over there . he said it worked great and was easy to clean as well . so i 'm just giving you second hand info but hope it helps . it made life more bearable for him . 
sure does ! 
i 've only had mine for 2months..i 'm not sure , but other reviewers have said they have vacuumed or lightly brushed the filter to clean . 
the filter is fine . it catches anything you can see . when i am sweeping and see dust floating in a shaft of sunlight , i put the air filter in the room , turn it on full blast and come back 10 minutes later . the air is clear . nothing floating in the sunlight . 
i bought a carbon `` trim to fit '' filter from lowes and use it along with the permanent filter in this machine ( they both fit , but it 's tight ) . on a monthly basis , i vacuum the permanent filter and change the carbon filter each quarter . 
it 's very quiet . no louder than a very quiet fan . unless i am right next to it , i barely hear it . 
yes , i run mine 24hrs a day . 
they were n't allowing it to be shipped to ca for a while there , and i could n't find out why . i just tried to add it to my shopping cart now and it did n't give me that message , so i guess they fixed whatever it was ... 
we have 2 and they run non-stop . they do a heavy duty job in our bird room . pay attention on replacing and cleaning the filters so your true air will last a long time . 
i wish i could help you . i sent this to my son when he was stationed in afghanistan because of all the dust . he said it worked well . easy to clean , which was a real selling point for him , he said . how this helps . good luck . 
this unit will not clean smoke from the air as it is not a true hepa filter . i sent the hamilton beach back and bought this http : www.amazon.com gp product b004vgigvy ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 
i do n't know . you are n't supposed to have to replace it . just vacuum it to clean it . 
the air enters the front around the oval plate . it exits on the left through a plastic grill . there is quite a breeze on high , but it is barely detectable on low . we have three on 24 7 , one for a couple of years . 
74 '' tall 
no , this is intended to be used in conjunction with a liner . thanks ! 
we used this in a dorm room to act as a door for a closet and it 's a great curtain . sorry i ca n't help you find a liner . 
yes . 
2.5 '' h x 13.8 '' w x 37.4 '' l 
i could n't findbone so i made one . went to joanns and bought fabric for $ 10 and used the orange one that came w ironing board as a pattern for the new one . it took less than an hour to make the new one . 
about 20 '' steps are very narrow . the tip of the ironing board from the floor is about 33 ' 
if you look closely at the ladder part of the board , you see 4 black rubber cushions ... that opens up into a vee and walla an ironing board . 
yes 
mine is a wire mesh , with padding and a nice cotton cover . i did n't like the orange so i dyed it blue 
hi there , the total length when folded is 48 inches . thank you 
ca n't really answer that ... gave it to my son as a gift 
the dryer works wonders , but if you do n't have one you can hold it flat in front of you and bounce it on your lower arms for a bit . i usually do this after finding a 20lb cat has spent the day curled on it . 
hi ragie , viscoelastic foam or memory foam tends to give off a smell when new . you can let it air out for a day or two , or you can even go ahead and wash it ( the whole pillow ) if you want to expedite the process . we are constantly using fresh memory foam , and we vacuum seal the pillows to keep shipping costs down which sometimes traps some of the viscoelastic memory foam smell which will disappear . 
hi , no our pillows do not contain pbde 's we manufacture our pillows in california and have some of the strictest bedding laws . pbde has been banned in california . 
this product does have an oder initially . i was concerned , but now it really is not an issue . i ordered another ... good product , good value . 
i do not feel any difference between this pillow and any other pillow as far as how cool it keeps me . i know that in the description they tell you that the bamboo should keep you cooler but i honestly do n't feel any difference . i think that where this pillow stands out is in its extreme comfort - it is definitely more comfortable than any other pillow i have owned . 
hi , we updated our packaging , and the `` bag '' is simply the new packaging = ) 
it 's actually 20 x 30. the dimensions on amazon are most likely the shipping dimensions as it comes vacuum packed . 
very thick . especially after washing . it will go flat but just put in dryer for about 10 min . 
kind of . when you push in on it with your hand you can feel clumps of memory foam . it is kind of hard to describe the feeling but it is a pleasent feeling . it is very suddle and when laying on it you do n't feel it at all . 
queen size pillow is good for me and i 'm a bigger guy ... 
the pillow stays cool , but it is very firm . if you have large shoulders and like a firm pillow , you will like it as a side sleeper . if you are petite or small shouldered , this pillow will not work for you as it is very dense and will have your neck and head elevated at an awkward level . 
they 're machine washable . they recommend washing 2 at once to even out the load but one could substitute a towel if you only have 1 . 
hi rk , our pillows do not have pbde 's . we manufacture our pillows in california , not china and do not have any pbde 's 
i have a c-pap also and have been using the queen . i do n't find a problem since the foam , after about 5 or so minutes , conforms to my face shape with the mask on . i have the full face nasal mask and it seems okay with the queen pillow ... and i sleep in the middle of it . i 'd say king may work fine since , like i said , it kind of shapes around whatever is laying on top of it after a few minutes . 
this one is great , is does n't sink lower than a couple of inches and still cradles your head . if that 's what you 're looking for , go for it . 
i dont have to keep turning this pillow around to find cool spot like many of the pillows ive had in the past ... i get a supper nites sleep on this pillow , , , , , i know it may seem a little pricy but it is worth every penny in my openion , , , , , mike 
my pillow is a standard size pillow . it fits in a standard pillow case , a little snug but it fits . 
king size it 's pretty thick so i guess you 'll be satisfied ! ! ! 
i have had mine for a couple months now it is a king size . i have also bought the queen size for my bf.. we both love our pillows.. i plan on buying 2 more . 
no . it 's too thick 
i use 2 of them under my king mattress that sags and they do n't really work . mattres still sags a lot and it was n't worth the money at all ! ! i would n't recommend them , but have n't been able to find anything else , and researched a lot . everyone told me to get a new mattres the sag thing is it 's only 4 years old and we 're not heavy people . again , i dont recommend them 
i see no reason why it would n't work with your bed . with a regular spring mattress in king or queen size , you order 2 helpers : one for each side of the bed . the size you will order is different for a king or a queen so a problem i can see with your bed is that you may need a smaller size for each side than normal since the middle of the bed or the barrier between the two sides seems to be holding up okay and is n't sagging . i would measure the width of the problem area of one side and compare that to the widths available in the mattress helper and choose the one that seems like it will correct what you need without pushing the middle up to an unduly degree . then just order 2 of that size . if all else fails , call mattress helper 's customer service and ask for advice . 
each section is about 5 inches wide and 3-4 inches tall and does take out the sag of my mattress . i 've tried other remedies and this the best one so far for me . hope this helps you out 
mattress helper was not designed for a sleeper sofa , so it may be hard to say if you can leave the mattress helper in the sleeper sofa when you fold it up . it would depend on how much space remains in the sleeper sofa when the mattress is folded into it . this is not to say that mattress helper wont work under a sleeper sofa mattress but to leave it under the mattress inside the couch may not work due to space . 
i have a full size bed and bought one 31 inch and one 20 inch which fits perfectly 
i would recommend that for the california king that you purchase two of the 31 '' x 50 '' mattress helpers and place them between the mattress and box spring in the area that is too soft or is sagging . for the extra length of the california king mattress , you might decide that you need the mattress helper mini add-on which you use in addition to the mattress helpers for extra length and a level bed surface . we will be offering this mattress helper mini to our amazon listing within the next week . thank you for your interest in mattress helper . 
i do n't know about a twin size , but even two of the big size ( shipped in the same box ) , was probably 6-8 pounds at most . and that was 2 boxes inside a bigger box . they 're made out of foam , so are very light . 
i , too , have a `` no flip '' , but not sure about the top of the mattress . in my previous comments , you may notice that i put mine `` across '' the bed instead of up and down . i am beginning to notice that the side less slept on is higher than the `` sleep '' side . but theres still no sagging where lower back lays . 
yes , absolutely . we have many customers who have used mattress helper on this type of memory foam mattress and are quite happy because of it . purchase 2 of the 20 '' for full coverage under your mattress . thank you . 
thank you for your question . yes you can only buy 1 mattress helper but for a more level bed surface , i recommend 2. a 31 '' x 50 '' is the minimum you need . 
it 's 100 percent cotton to it can be out in the washing machine . i bought a king size for a queen bed though . that way if it shrank it would n't be too small 
if i remember correctly it was blue . i sent the set back because it was not grey but more purple lavender . hope this helps . 
throw pillow 3 , 2 shams , bed skirt , comforter . colors are lighter than shown on line 
it 's 100 % polyester fiber 
i thought the comfortor would be more grey than it actually is it 's more of a grey lavender color and the pillows are blue it 's not exactly what i expected but i still love it and feel it 's very well made i kept it and love it ! 
it would be fine to use year round . it 's not thin , but not too thick to use during summer . 
ma'am , i 'm so glad you asked ... i just got off the phone from those fine folks at worksharptools ... they , like their products , are incredible . i never hesitate to call , when i have questions . they 're polite , patient , and thoroughly professional ... to answer your question , they have a special diamond belt kit for the ken onion edition . it includes two belts , a 180 grit , and a 1500 grit . these are what they recommend for sharpening ceramic blades . these belts are available here , at amazon.com , with part # 0002970 , and have a price of $ 25.99 ... i could not be happier with my gear from worksharptools , as they have exceeded my every expectation . quality , efficiency , and adaptability , these devices do it all ... i heartily recommend their tool grinding attachment , # wssak081111 , and their belt grinding attachment , # wsssak0881112 . additionally , the belts that all of the ken onion edition knife and tool sharpener and attachments use , are professional grade ... you wo n't find better , even at twice the price ... hope i 've answered your question ... god bless you and yours ... 
i can not answer `` why , '' as i did n't engineer the product , however the unit does up to 30 degrees per side . this will get you to 60 degrees inclusive which is about as high as i can think of going for any blade . it could be that the older unit listed it 's angles as inclusive so , for example , if you were in the 40 degree guide , you were really sharpening to 20 degrees per side . hope that helps . 
yep - just pop off the angle guide , rotate the belt system forward and you have yourself a handy-dandy tool sharpener . i always check the balance of the blade after grinding to make sure one side is n't heavier than the other . i simply balance the blade from the center and if one side falls , i remove a little more material from that side . it 's a rough gauge , but accurate enough for a mower blade . 
i have researched two company 's that sell 3 4 `` belts in 12 '' lgth . the first is econaway abrasives out of michigan . they sell the x22 and x65 style belts . these are equivalent grits to work sharp 's grits at less than $ 1.60 ! the x4 at 3000 grit is hard to find , except from amazon or worksharp . the other company is abrasive express . they require minimum quantities of 18 per grit , but about .75 per belt . 
the larger , ko model , is marked 1.5amps on the motor so a 150w power supply probably would not work ( at least very long . ) the smaller model is marked .7amps so it should work with your 150w power supply . power=current x voltage p=ixe 1.5 x 110 = 165 watts needed 0.7 x 110 = 77 watts needed jeff otherson 
i was able to sharpen my bk9 on the original so i 'm not sure what you were doing wrong . but if the original can do it then so can this . 
it will do regular scissors and scissors for hair cutting . i am fairly confident that it can sharpen electrician scissors as well . this tool comes with a significant amount of adjustment settings for angles so that it should make sharpening electrician scissors entirely possible . 
should be no problem.i sharpen serrated knives all the time.i assume you mean knife height is 1.5 inches , if so will do a great job . 
i 'd suspect fine . i 've done plenty of small paring knives . you may not be able to use the roller knife guide but with practice and a steady hand you should n't have any trouble at all . 
yes . you will need to buy the wskts diamond belt kit . it fits both the original knife sharpener and the ken onion edition . it is 1 2 inch in width instead of 3 4 inch but will work just fine . i have it and sharpen our ceramic knives . 
this ships in 2 boxes through ups . there is an easy assembly video on the sofab website . the boxes are approximately 54 '' x 30 '' x 15 '' in size . below are all the dimensions on this particular loveseat . thank you for your interest in our products . dimensions for coco loveseat : overall dimension : 55 '' l x 35 '' w x 36.5 '' h seat height : 21 '' seat depth : 21 '' packed dimensions : 54 '' x 30 '' x 15 '' 
the beige color in the picture is pretty accurate depiction . the fabric is a smooth polyester blend . 
no , is not a sleeper sofa . 
only the cushions have zippers for cleaning . 
we have 75 lbs lab . no problem with hair on fabric . fabric between velvety and smooth , more like canvas . 
yes . they are removable . the only problem is is that you have to build the sofa yourself and these back cushions are really hard to fit inside the case . my cushions are deformed and the couch is uncomfortable . i 've had the sofa ten months . 
the back cushions are a little overstuffed , slouchy and shaped to fit over the side a little bit . the seat cushions are firmer , and completely square . all of them have zippers to remove the foam inside and for washing . the cushions are reversible in the fact that you could turn them over and use the other side , there is no difference , the zippers are on the ends . 
56 '' w x 36.5 '' h x 38 '' d 
it will be close , the love seat ships in 2 boxes and the packed dimensions are 54 '' x 30 '' x 15 '' . 
this love seat comes disassembled . it is made this way to help customers fit furniture into difficult areas to move these type of large pieces into such as walk up apartments , dorms , basements , loft areas , boats , rvs , vacation homes , and dorms . the dimensions are below to assist you with your decision . the packed dimension provide the dimension of the boxes the loveseat comes in . let us know if there is anything else we can do to assist you . overall dimension : 55 '' l x 35 '' w x 36.5 '' h seat height : 21 '' seat depth : 21 '' packed dimensions : 54 '' x 30 '' x 15 '' 
yes the cushions are removable . 
we bought one last year and it came with the small pillows ! ! ! 
no , the lass is not a sofa bed . 
here are all the dimensions we currently have on that particular loveseat . let us know if you need any additional dimensions , we are always glad to assist you . overall dimensions : 65 '' l x 35 '' w x 38 '' h seat height : 21 '' seat depth : 21 '' packed dimension : 58 '' x 30 '' x 15 '' 
it is my understanding that sofab has moved from the spring loaded cushions and moved to a solid foam core with zipped sofa fiber wrap . this style does have a zipper . 
this item does require assembly . it is my understanding that sofab has moved away from the spring loaded cushions . the cushions now have a solid foam core with zipped sofa fiber wrap . these cores are really nice and have improved the product line overall . 
all i can say about sureguard is that the price was right and my son has not pulled the sheets off the bed because of the heat of the plastic from other manufacture 's products . there has been no mishaps so i do n't know how it is regarding wetness . 
yes . tpu to be precise . 
wife says temperature is normal not hot or cold . we are happy with it 
my son has peed on it several times , it does protect the mattress very well . 
not really . the sides are fabric , but you might try using scotch guard . that may help . 
absolutely ... ... ... i just measured my total mattress depth and it is 12 '' . 
hi , i guess that depends on what you want from your mattress pad . it 's not pillowy or squishy or quilted in any way . it 's a thin soft short-pile terrycloth . i put mine under my mattress pad . 
this product will cover up to 20 inch mattresses , etc . so if you only have just that size and no deep pillow top , gel top or any additional items on your mattress then this product may slide around your bed . please `` read the size dimensions '' carefully . because there is nothing like buying a product and having to return it `` on-line '' . i have a 14 '' mattress plus a 4 '' each pillow top and gel top additions and there is still room so the product is great but if it is just for your mattress then i would not recommend it . most products these days are made for the deeper mattresses around 20 inches and up . just hope this helps . also , you can contact the manufacturer directly for more advice . 
we recommend buying the cal king size ( 72 x 84 ) . if you do n't see it as an option , then it is currently out of stock . we apologize for any inconvenience caused , but we expect to have more soon . 
the queen size would fit your mattress best . 
i have a regular king and fits perfectly . 
i have had potty training accidents on this and it worked great ! nothing got through to the material underneath . 
no . these mattress covers are made for memory foam mattresses . the side of the cover that contacts the mattress has a waterproof material to protect the foam . i use mine on a tempurpedic mattress with no problems . 
yes 
the packaging does not contain the words `` complies with california tb117 '' . the mattress protector does not contain any `` concealed filling materials '' and therefore does not fall under the regulations of california tb117 . 
we just have a regular mattress too ... ..this mattress pad works perfectly ! 
yes it is . our mattress is 14 '' deep and we have plenty on all sides , about 4 '' . very soft too ! 
my mattress is 12 inches deep , and it fits fine . the outside edge of it seems to be pretty strechy good elastic , so i 'm sure it will fit around a less deep mattress as well . 
it will be a little big for a standard size , but it does have elastic so it might just work 
i have a memory foam sleep number and i do n't even know it is on . so the answer is no . 
yes , the backing is 100 % polyurethane . 
queen is back in stock . 
yes , you could use this on a futon and fold it easily . it is not much thicker than a fitted sheet . 
i think it would work fine and give you extra protection for your mattress . we tend to spill coffee in the early morning and the mattress cover has been helped prevent stains . 
no it says usa on the tag 
probably not . however if you spray it down with some vinegar full strength , and air it out for a few days , that might kill off some of the old dog smell . 
i would think so . ours is high and there 's still room is need be . 
the one i am using is for a king-size , so i do n't feel qualified to answer your question . try info @ sureguardmattress.com 
yes it does . nice and soft and soundless . 
yes 
yes there is a bare floor attachment and a crevice tool and a brush as well as the power head . 
just measured with my tape measure for you and appears to be exactly 12 '' or 1 foot . : ) 
box says 17 feet . it seems like you have 15 usable feet . 
this vacuum has a plastic container that you empty after use instead of a paper bag . 
yes 
yes it does . 
i 'm not sure on the exact weight it 's definitely light ! ! ! 
yes 
no 
yes us 110 only 
according to the label , 2 amps . 
it has a powered roll brush and cleans better than one would expect from such a lightweight vacuum . 
light hair , light dirt . definitely not meant for a deep clean 
nope u ca n't that is one down grade about this vacuum i returned it cause it 's the worst and i did n't even pick up 
its separate 
yes , it does . 
yes 
it 's removable and washable . i do n't know what it 's made of , but it 's not disposable . 
i empty mine after each use . i have had no trouble with clogging or removing it from stick . i use it daily and have had for few months . 
i believe it would . my little dog tracks in sand and the dirt devil picks it up . 
if you are attaching the mop and broom holder to dry wall you would use anchor bolts and if you are attaching it to wood you would use wood screws . hold the holder up on the wall where you plan to hang it . take a level and place it up on the top of the holder and use a pencil to mark the holes after you have leveled the holder . if you are using anchor bolts , drill holes into the dry wall and tap the plastic holder that will hold the bolts into the dry wall . after you have tapped them in , line up the holder with the holes and insert the bolts , them using a phillips screwdriver turn the until they are tightly inserted . if you are attaching it to wood , use the pencil method , the take an ice pick and start the holes . line up the holder with the holes and screw the screws in until the holder is tightly adhered to the wall . done ! 
yes , it does . i think they changed the design of this holder over the years , because at least two versions are pictured in the product images . one version ( older ) had two concealed slide-out hooks . if you like that idea , that design may still be sold by v-tech . ( it 's possible that an even older version had no hooks at all . ) the one i bought a month or so ago ( note : bought from sh toys ; amazon was out of stock at the time ) has six fold-down plastic hooks ( as in the first product image ) . they 're thick and fairly stiff . i ended up not being able to use it and gave it to a friend instead , but i liked the fold-down hooks . they seemed sturdy and well-sized . that said , if you use the hooks , you will probably end up blocking at least one tool . you will need to take things off the hooks to get those tools out . if you 're still considering this product , i hope my answer helps . 
17 inches 
when i do this type of installation without directions i try to match the plastic insert that first goes into the wall and then use the two bits smaller for a tighter fit ( you may crush the plastic if not careful ) or use one drill bits smaller than the plastic insert so the fit is closer to the size . then once you have spaced all your inserts in your wall ( they are level and correspond with the holes of the item going on the wall , line up the item on the wall and hand screw in 80 % of he way until you have all screws attaching the item to the wall . then tighten down all screws until the wall mount is secure . i hope that helped you some . 
light gray 
i do not know the exact openings of this unit but they are wide enough that the wands from my vacuum fit . all my mops , brooms , etc are no problem . if you need the exact measurement i can measure when i return home ? 
it depends on the wall material and the type of anchors you use to mount it on the wall . it is able to support my flair electric vacuum in the ball holders , but you ca n't hang it from one of the flip out pegs as they are only plastic . as long as the holder is anchored well , it should support an item that is heavier as long as the handle of your vacuum fits in the holder , which can accommodate up to 1 3 16 '' width . 
sure ... unless the door is hollow . 
no it does n't . this holder is 17 '' long and the outside holes are about 2.5 inches from each side and then middle is about 6 inches apart . there is just 3 holes total . hopefully that makes sense . i do n't have min drilled into a stud and have n't had any problems . it 's definitely a nice holder ! 
about 350 grams 
the one i have is 10in and 7 8 of an in.. should work perfectly for your 11 in pan . 
it is not the correct lid for 12 '' techef frying pan . 12 '' lid is currently out of stock . it will be available soon . 
i do n't know about that specific style , but that lid fits on the 11 inch techef art pan i bought . 
i would say no , while the tempered glass may be fine the oven would melt the hard plastic handle . in addition the lids are vented so it would not trap the great like a traditional oven lid . i would n't do it . the pan has the same handle so i would n't put it in the oven either . 
there is no hole on the base , but you can take out the base and bolt the stuffer in the board 
i 'm not sure anymore but it really does work great and i would recommend it 
work both ways , just adjust the canister.. thanks 
yes 
yes 
mine came with a parts list , i 'd google it 
i have it at my other restaurant and wont be there until next week . i will let you know then . 
no se . 
no . i only have what was originally shipped . i would contact the manufacturer directly 
36 pounds , dimension i dont remember 
does not have temperature control but the rack is somewhat adjustable . two settings one closer to the element and one further away from the element . 
better build and a little bigger . i 'm too happy with this one . 
felicitas . it does very well on a 1inch steak . 
the top grate is stainless steel . the rest of the bbq wipes down easy with disinfecting wipes ( my preferences ) . also add a little a little water in bottom drip tray before cooking for a easier clean up . this is our second one and love ! love , love it . 
there is only an off on button . the heat is not adjustable . i 'm not sure what the highest temp is at . however , it cooks great regardless . 
no we do n't . sorry . 
i think the quality is similar . they were both gifts to different sized families . i did have dinner with the family of the bigger one and we really liked it . hope this helps . 
110v standard u.s. style plug 
the cooking dimensions of the grill are 13 inches by 7.9 inches thank you 
i use the grill almost every day if not twice a day . it 's one of the few grills without teflon which i 've heard can cause cancer . i like the fact that the fat drips below without getting back on the food . i ca n't digest any type of oil or fat so it 's essential for me to have this type of grill if i 'm to cook something . i 'm very happy with the grill . it took me long enough to find it , and i 'm glad that amazon had it . 
i would have to say no . it is a small table . four people with four plates takes up all the room . you ca n't put more than one serving dish in the middle . if you have plenty of room around the table it would work for plus size people . i am plus size and the chairs are very sterdy . 
yes , assembly is required . 
2-3 labor days 
yes , thi table will last long time 
yes , it froths half & half - does a great job ! 
both concern the amount of milk you put in the machine . one is the limit for froth milk the other is for steamed milk . 
i do n't think ssh . 
no it wo n't work , it has a heat sensor so if it 's already warm the machine wo n't work 
the end result will be the same . the aeroccino plus has a handle and a pour spout . also it is slightly shorter and wider inside . the aeroccino 3 has no pour spout and is taller and more narrow inside . they both preform the same way . you would be happy either way . 
if it 's slightly different , it is likely a paddle for lattes . it 's designed to produce a bit less froth . 
yes it does . that is how i was introduced to the machine . my daughter had one and she uses almond and soy milk . both work . the almond milk tastes a little more earthy when whipped up and hot . but i do n't drink a lot of it , so that may be normal . as a side note . i do n't know how i got along without this before and my latte bill has dwindled to nothing . 
110 
hot and delicious . there is also a cold froth option . 
if you are trying to froth milk for coffee you can choose either to heat it or not . for heating the time to completion obviously varies depending on how warm the milk is at the beginning and how much milk there is in the frother . it would take less time if you did not want to heat it but either way it is less than a minute . not sure about the 12 oz part . we just make enough to cover top of coffee 
12 volt . 
yes , clean cat litter well 
i use mine on all hard floors and area rugs and it works fine . i think it would be fine as long as you say the rug is low pile . it even picks of cat litter which is better than most cordless vacuums . 
the battery is internal , i 've never seen it . it comes with the charger , that the stick vac rests in . i 'm still thrilled with my vac . 
great appliance on carpet-tile and wood floors-zero scratching ! 
yes , mine is mounted to the wall and constantly charging the battery when not in use . it does n't have to be mounted to the wall and can be free standing if desired . 
it must be propped up and only on a rough surface like a carpet , not on a tile floor . 
yes . it does come with a charging stand but mine stopped charging after 40 days and the seller refused to replace it saying it 's out of 30 day return policy and asked to contact the manufacturer instead . i wanted one immediately so ended up buying a shark stick vac from a local store . 
i 'm a college student living in a dorm room so it 's enough for cleanly go through the whole room . never tried a greater space though . 
the back of the upright handle will be approx . 12 '' off the floor before the brush head starts to lift off the floor . this unit , as a whole , works best on bare floors . hope that answers your question ! 
the drawers are deep but not deep enough for a normal sized bottle of nail polish to stand upright . there is a top section where you can stand nail polish bottles upright . 
no there no base to it 
there are four straight dividers and one x shaped divider . 
`` 7 deep . it holds a lot of stuff and has various size removable drawer inserts that i took out and use for other stuff . 
thanks fot your question ! i do n't have the drawer measurements available but according to the product details the length and width of this organizer are 9.5 '' x 7 '' . hopefully this will give you some idea of the size of the drawers that fit inside . 
this are the measurements of the bottom drawer 9 '' w 7 '' l 2.67 '' d 
no 
my drawers came with the top draw with 4 sections . and 3 additional dividers . 
i do n't use mine 
i do n't use mine as a jewelry holder but it can definitely be used as one . it came with plenty of dividers - so it could work ! 
i can fit 32 bottles on mine . i have some sephora by opi but mainly china glaze and opi . 
u can hang in a cupboard but the shelves are n't deep or tall enough for spice containers . 
bout 4in in between each shelf 
i have not but if i did i would use the ones that lock in like velcro for pictures . 
it is just 1 
size wise yes , height of the bottle ? maybe . if it was no bigger than a nail polish bottle it would 
the back is clear . 
you 'd have to use quite a bit ... .and it would depend on what you are actually storing ... .i use this as an organizer for my makeup compacts , so like palettes , foundation , blushes . i ended up using 2 screws . it 's extremely sturdy and carries a bit of weight . if you 're worried about holes ... .i would still use screws and just spackle : x 
you have to place them sideways , but the lip is high enough to hold them , and the little shelf deep enough to let you put one or two depending on how thick the compact is . 
no , they do not come with . there are spots in the back where you can place them , but they are not included . 
absolutely ! ! ! ! ! this is the reason i bought this particular sweeper . just love it and you will too ! 
no the smart charger is sold separately . this one comes with the regular wall charger . 
i use it mostly for my floors but can do thin carpets . 
yes it is nimh battery 
these are engrqaved and yes , they are dishwasher safe . thanks for your business . bill wright treyco 
on the brewery growler you receive 1 line with 15 characters including spaces and one 4 digit year at no additional charge . you may contact us at 800.320.2664 
you might try a brewing supply store . i know the distributor we use for this product does not offer that as an option for purchase . bill wright treyco 
once you place your order we will email you for that . thanks 
the word brewery is on the growler set and it ca n't be removed , also it fits only 4 digits year . 
they take about 3 days to ship so if you order today , you should be ok. i would suggest 2nd day air just to be sure . thanks for your business . bill 
sorry for the confusion . you get a first and last name and a 4 digit year . brewery is already part of the engraving . once you place your order , you can either email us with the engraving or we will contact you . thanks . 
it is not . you could , but do not want to put these as it wears the healthy coating of the pan . you will notice a decrease in even heating after some dishwashing . also changing from hot to cold too quickly ( running under cold water wright off stove0 will wear it out . i always wipe clean while still warm and it cleans super easy . worth the hassel for a better functioning pan in my opinion ! 
i 'm not sure . the pan itself is fantastic . i got it for my daughter and she says the clean up is a snap . wash by hand and do n't use metal on it and you should have it for years ! 
no . not at all . 
no lid i 'm using an old one when needed not perfect but works 
here is a link to the lid which can be purchased separately : http : www.amazon.com ozeri-zp-26gl-green-frying-10-inch dp b006qcl672 ref=sr_1_2 ? s=home-garden & ie=utf8 & qid=1389169402 & sr=1-2 & keywords=ozeri+lid hope this helps 
this question was already answered ( see below ) . it has a lifetime warranty against defects . 
inside top edge bottom is approximately 1 2 inch less . very nice pans minimal oil , do not need to cook on high heat . love them i have all 3 sizes of the ozeri style fry pans . good luck . angela 
yes 
the 10 '' lid does not fit this stainless steel pan . there is a 12 '' green earth lid available through ozeri . 
i would say about 1.5 inches deep 
no , it does n't on the unit i purchased . 
the entire unit is plastic with a stainless finish . 
red light means it 's off . touch + to turn on to green . if nothing comes out but you can hear the motor , it might take a few times to prime . i generally try to refill before it is bone dry . 
works ok. lotion is a bit thicker . only saw it in use with lotion for a short time at relative 's house 
yes , this product has a 2 year warranty . i now have three different simplehuman products and have nothing but rave reviews for all three . they are great quality and look really nice ! 
you can find it behind the dispenser spigot ( on the back ) will find a plus and minus sign press that section and a blinking like should come up unless your unit is not equipped with that feature 
this is about 2 '' x 2 1 2 '' and about 9 `` height works well . 
i would try rubbing alcohol . we owned a plating shop years ago and i would spray rubbing alcohol on the finished product to remove spots . i also hear that baby oil works too , have n't tried it . good luck . 
no 
the sensor is in the `` head '' . what is great is that it 's looking down , not forward . i read reviews of other pumps that are so sensitive that you walk by and they get activated . not this one , as this is `` looking '' down and it only dispenses soap when you want it to . i had it for eight months , and love it . 
these are made in china . and a joke when you see them . pay attention to the size as if you are expecting standard size ice-trays you will be sorely disappointed . they are no bigger than the palms of my hands . 
just got this today . the plastic wrapping says made in china . 
cubes are a optic one inch square . they are easy to eject from tray . but i wish i had bought additional trays . you can tell from photos about how big they are based on cube size . would buy again and an to 
mine haven't.. had them for a cpl months now , love them ! 
currently , we do not carry silicone cup cake cups . however , we are looking to expand out kitchen line to include things like this ! please check back with us soon . i am sure we will be doing some form of promotion for this . thanks ! 
i did n't know that silicone products were toxic . i have been using silicone spatulas since they have come out on the market because the other types fell apart during cooking . since the silicone ones held up , i order the ice trays . my husband and i have suffered no ill effects . 
mr. ms. mcalister , we are always working to perfect our product , so the answer to your question is yes , redesign is in the works . however , it is not readily available and requires some time to make a mold for the new product . we appreciate your business and please be on the lookout for both a redesigned , optimized tray , and larger 2 '' square trays in the future ! thanks again ! 
there are 2 ice trays ! ! 
currently marked at $ 14.50 ... 
mr. brush , each cavity is a 1 '' x 1 '' x 1 '' square cube . these are typically smaller than your average ice cube , but that was intentional . tundra inc. really wanted to provide a space-saving , quality ice cube tray and that is what we have done . we will be providing a medium and large size in the near future , as well as a variety of colors potentially , so be on the lookout for that . i hope this answers your question and should you purchase the trays , i hope they work out for you ! thank you for your question and happy halloween ! sincerely , tundra incorporated 
these sheets are so comfortable cool in summer warm in winter . i love them , i also have bamboo towels form cariloha 
great question , frank ! unfortunately at this time , we do n't offer extra long twin sheets . hopefully we should have some to offer you this winter ! 
i do n't think so . ours is only 12 '' deep 
i used for pomegranates and it worked great ! nothing like fresh cold pomegranate juice ( i leave them in the fridge before juicing ) . after cutting them in half , i would recommend making some quarter slits in the pomegranate though before juicing depending on the size it will help get more juice out . or cut them into quarters . 
sorry but there is no brand name on it . i will say it is very heavy and seems to be well built for something that came from china . we like it very much . we have it in costa rica for all forms of citrus . i would buy it again . 
i use a measuring cup that is 4.5 '' tall and 4 '' wide . it fits pretty well . 
we have only used it twice , so no paint chipping . it is aluminum . a friend has the same one and loves it . 
i do n't know for sure , but i would assume china . by its quality , def not the usa . 
with the lever up it is 28 '' ( 72cm ) and down it is 16 '' ( 40cm ) . 
yes , we have used it on graefruits . 
yes very strong and good 
mine was all ready adjusted . 
i have tried only with fruits but you can give it a shot ! 
this model has the shorter carafe which fits under standard cabinets . it would be dishwasher safe if it was n't for the blade gears . cleaning is very easy . just put a little dish soap in the carafe then fill it half up with water and run it on high for 20-30 seconds and rinse it out . 
yes , this model did . 
this is ruthy from the handy house . no it 's not glass . they need to correct that . it is correct on our website and details . i will let amazon know so the can do that . thank you ! 
most of my smoothies begin with 16 oz of flax milk , almond milk etc . i find that once i add all my ingredients ending with spinach kale or other greens and topping it off with ice it comes close to the top . once it blends all down to that silky smoothness it comes to about have the container . one might consider it 'overkill ' to use the vitamix for smaller personal smoothies but either way it does the job just fine . cleaning up is simple as well . typically i can rinse the container but when you have thicker concoctions you can add a drop of soap to half a container of warm water , blend for a few minutes and viola - clean ! 
i only have the wet food blade container . but i have used it for things such as grinding peanuts into peanut butter . i have not tried coffee beans into grounds since the quanity one would have to grind would be too much anyway . personally , i would get the mixer ( it is really good ) and wait on getting the dry container . you may find you are happy without it . you can also look directly on the vita mix web site for some video tutorials . they show the dry container there too and what they do with it . 
no , this one not including dry at all . if you want dry you pay extra 120 more 
yes , it does ! you have to register your blender on the vitamix website , but its easy . 
did n't know about the recall and have not been notified . we use it every day and have had no issues . i will check the blade dates tonight to make sure . 
this is the pro 300 
yes . since it 's variable speed , it 's trial and error for a few times . does a great job with daiquiris 
i have both a 5000 ( the predecessor to the 5200 ) and a pro 750 ( like the 300 , but with the addition of 5 presets ) . the 300 is a next generation vitamix as are the 7500 and the pro 750. these machines come equipped with a low profile , wide bottom , 64 oz . container with a 4 inch blade , which is far more efficient than the standard tall and narrow 64 oz . container with a 3 inch blade that 's used with earlier models . the wider bottom makes it much easier to remove heavy and or sticky contents from the container , and the 4 inch blade makes quick work of everything . it 's not really that the newer models do n't handle small quantities well , it that the new container with the wider bottom requires more volume to cover the blades . therefore , batches under two cups are best processed in a smaller container . i have a 32 ounce container that i originally bought to use with my 5000 when i needed to make a small batch of something , like salad dressing for example . i find it 's also the perfect container to use for making small batches with my pro 750. in my opinion , the next generation series of machines are far superior to previous models . 
i start with the liquids , then add the pulpy fruit ( like apples , bananas etc . ) i blend this for a few seconds on low speed . then i add the bulk veggies ( like a whole two fist fulls of romaine lettuce or kale . i drop ice on top of this to weigh it down . i blend this on low and gradually increase to full speed . blend for about 60 seconds max . if needeed use the tamper to push down the lettuce ( sometimes just the weight of ice does it ) do n't overblend . you will loose nutient content if you over blend it . i think that may also cause the air . i do n't air in my smoothies when i do it this way . for soups , you need to blend a long time to make it hot . but in teh endi put in some solid pieces and just pulse them in . this makes a nicer soup , and removes a little air build up . i also notice some veggies tend to be more air prone than others . baby spinach and romaine work great . also freash ingrendients . ones that are starting to be a little past their prime foam a little more . 
increased hp to 2.2hp , 40 % quieter , low profile carafe to fit under counter , 1-10 speed , no more variable high speed switch to enable highest speed , pulse switch took its place , 4 '' blade diameter instead of 3 '' . 
i 'm pretty sure you can , since the vitamix itself can heat up the contents if you run it for about 5 - 6 minutes . and there 's a video of a vitamix representive himself pouring boiling water into it : https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=ayqbxoke-f4 at about 14:50 . 
yes , the vitamix 7500 ( which is a next gen ) , the pro 300 , and the creations elite are all the same machine , but they come with different cookbooks , and the creations elite comes with a 48 oz carafe instead of the 64 ( see https : secure.vitamix.com certified-reconditioned-next-generation.aspx ? coupon=06-007021 ) . the 750 pro is different - it has added presets . a helpful site : http : joyofblending.com which-vitamix-to-buy 
yes , both are the next generation motor paired with the wider container . both are without the presets that show up on the pro 750. more than you 'd ever care to know about the various models is here : http : joyofblending.com which-vitamix-to-buy http : blenderdude.com articles vitamix-models ( i sifted through these myself when trying to pick which model to buy ) 
yes it is - all current vitamix spin at a high speed that will produce heat due to friction from the blades on the item ( s ) you 're blending - the vitamix professional 300 has the 4 '' blades ( vs. the older 3 '' blades , on say the 5200 ) and would therefore have an even faster speed at the blade tip and therefore produce more frictional heat - i use this same friction heat principle daily to clean my vitamix , i add warm hot water and a drop of soap - after blending on high for 1-2 min , the soapy water foam is too hot to touch ( exceeds 160 f ) . more specifically to answer your specific question , i use this feature to make super creamy soups blended to a perfect top restaurant quality consistency . . . and hot . as another response commented , i have not had the problem of it whipping in too much air , i understand this happens due to making a very small amount of soup ( 1 serving only ) . my experience creating soups in the vitamix professional 300 have been that soups are blended to perfection ( i 've made many types : broccoli , tomato , lobster bisque , etc. , ) . 
preset blend programs . otherwise the same . 
yes checking the serial number on my blade it was manufactured after the recall . 
according the vitamix web site , this unit is 17.5 inches tall with the container in palce . you can veryify on the vitamix web site . 
this heavy duty turntable , would be great . it is probably over kill for kitchen needs , but if it fits your cabinet , it should work tirelessly . 
hi marie , nope . the hole is n't big enough for an umbrella pole to go through . however , amazon does have outdoor table lazy susans . i found this one for you and there are others - royal tahiti 20 '' round lazy susan w umbrella hole ( stain ) ( 1.25h x 20w x 20d ) - some are glass and some are tiered . hope this helps . kathy 
no . it spins 360 degrees . i have a pair of huge peavy speakers on mine . when i 'm working , i point the speakers to my desk . when i 'm running on the treadmill , i point them at the treadmill . they 're great and handle a lot of weight . 
although this turntable says it is rated for 150lbs . i feel the quality just isnt there . it 's mostly plastic . i purchased to put a round three tier glass table on it . i have about 50lbs on it and it has a hard time turning smoothly . my advice is look for something else of better quality . hope this helps . 
my husband and i agree that drilling a hole in the center would damage the turning mechanism . we would n't try it . you might want to contact the manufacturer . good luck ! 
rotates in both directions 
this is a great item but i 'm not going to recommend it for cake decorating . it does n't have the fluidly that you need . it 's more robust jobs . i used this for a tv to sit on . 
i think it work , but you would want to atattch it . i would suggest using something like liquid nails . 
hi restin . not knowing the statue you have , i ca n't guarantee it wo n't tip over ! however , the kind of base table that your statue and swivel are going to be on is important -- needs to be sturdy and level . i would place the object on the swivel with the front pulled a little forward and the heavy back being somewhat more to the center , if this is possible with your statue . the swivel base itself has been very sturdy for our use ( 60lb bonsai that i can now rotate easily and smoothly ) . play with it . also , `` museum gel , '' bought at art stores , is very helpful for peace of mind . i hope this is helpful -- lise 
it 's a good hearty item . i assume you mean you are going to balance a larger board and use it as a turn table . this should work just fine for you . just remember , if your board is too large , the corners will droop . i have a couple of these - one in my cupboard for canned goods and another for a plant stand , so i can rotate it for trimming the plant . good luck ... marie 
delivery is $ 150 
yes they are reversible , 
thanks for your question ! according to a supplier 's website the dimension of this loveseat are 40 '' h , 61 '' w , 38 '' d. i hope this helps ! 
yes , it is smaller than most recliners and you slide a little because it does n't recline back far enough . 
24 inches 
its real leather wrapped around foam cushions just like a couch . 
yes there are a couple of massage motors in the leg rest . 
yes ! in fact , it has one of the largest number of accessories i was able to find . they are made of plastic , but so far this they are working well . also , the terrycloth cover for steaming fabrics fits quite tight , but putting a washcloth over the attachment with a rubber band works just as well . 
yes 
you be better off buying a weed torch from home depot . 
any drugstore or pharmacy 
the steam is n't completely dry ; it 's damp . 
according to the web site www.vapamore.com it has a 1000 watt heating element . 
only if you use the water that was collected from the evaporated water and brought back to a liquid state . the point of distilled water is to have water that is pre-evaporated so that it only contain particles that are small enough or vaporize early enough to go through the steamer without building up and blocking the ports . 
no - the unit heats the water . 
the power cord is about 9-10 feet . you must use distiller water . 
120 volts 
it is about 8 '' tall . 
the flat part is 6 inches . i made a 6 '' cake and it fit with enough room to run a knife around it for frosting . 
5.5 '' high 
yes 
no the picture or video quality will be fine , i had no problem with my photos , it clear and perfect 
sorry i have n't tested it underwater ... . 
it can fit the 5s , or 5 . 
yes 
no 
definitely not . my rubbermaid sectioned container did not fit and it is smaller than the easy lunch boxes ( we have those too ) . i also found the lunchbox very heavy and the latch to lock unlock very hard to move and made out of jagged plastic . the lunchbox is a great idea with poor execution . hope this helps . 
hmm good question i personally have n't tested it my my little guys says his sandwich is still cold at lunch time put in cooler @ 7:30 eats @ 11:30 says the ice pack is still cold i 'd have to get back to you after i test it myself sorry not very helpful ... it 's packed and forgot ! ! ! ! 
hi mom , i cant say if the 3 compartment divided containers fit , before emailing you i went to store to look for them , i was going to measure with the actual container , but they did not have the 3 compartment zip lock container . i did add the interior dimensions to the description of the lunch box on amazon . the lunch box inside is 7 7 8 '' x 7 1 4 '' x 3 '' . i hope this helps . i have three kids twins 7 and a 10 year old . the biggest reason i did this lunch box is because i was so grossed out with how dirty the soft lunch bags get with the kids using them . we do not use many reusable containers for the lunch boxes because the lids seam to get left behind at school more than they come home . i do understand many people do use the containers so i will compile some more information on what does fit inside and post it . if i can help you in anyway please let me know . thank you in advance , happy holidays , amen wardy owner delicious agent : ) 
possibly . unfortunately , we never sent our munchkin with warm food , so i ca n't say for certain . 
hello . it is made of engineered wood with a scratch and stain resistant laminate finish . 
25 inches . it 's a good table for the price . easy build for a handy person . it 's not solid oak , so go easy tightening screws . i like it . 
no it ca n't . the box is also very heavy but well worth it . 
i was surprised that the storage was smaller than i expected but turns out it is perfect for magazines , remotes etc . it is 5 '' deep - full inside demensions are 5 '' x 15.5 '' x 37 '' . i work from home a lot so i store my computer cables , mouse and such in it . still love it ! 
it looks like this : http : www.sauder.com stylelab finishzoom.aspx ? finishid=221 
it 's exactly 24 '' - i am able to sit on the couch and use my computer very comfortably with it . i love it ! 
wonder have black on it ? i would like black one if not tht okay 
yes there are . please see these : http : www.amazon.com gp product b0081llb9e or http : www.amazon.com sauder-carson-washington-cherry-finish dp b00bmc54i8 ref=sr_1_1 ? m=a3qnpqsxeeah4p & s=merchant-items & ie=utf8 & qid=1391381967 & sr=1-1 & keywords=b00bmc54i8 
china 
it only measures to the tenths place , so 12.5 oz or 1lb 12.2oz not 12.55oz or 1lb 12.25oz . i hope this helps ! 
yes , it will display a negative result if something is removed from the scale after taring . because the sensors keep reading the weight of the items on the platform . please keep in mind to make sure the screen show '0 ' before you weigh an item , if it does n't show '0 ' , you may touch the tare key to clear the result and reset it to zero . 
60 seconds 
it measure grams , i do n't know how small the weight change is ... 
to avoid that , i would place a bowl on the scale , zero it out , and then add the amount of flour you need . that being said , the face is completely flat , so there are no crevices for it to get stuck in . 
the tray is 11.5 inches deep with a lip on front and back edges . it is 15 inches wide but there is no lip on the sides so a lap top can be wider than 15 inches . i am using the cart to hold a medical laser and it is very hi-tech looking and suits my need perfectly 
there is some assembly but it 's very simple and the hex wrench phillips screwdriver required are provided in the package . it took me 15 minutes . i 've spent more time wrestling with the battery case of an emergency lantern . 
thanks for your questions ! this item is currently available from these sellers : 
9 3 4 '' x 6 '' 
it does not , just 1 decimal . 
return it 
no , it ca n't 
just press the on off key and hold it for about 2 seconds . 
under the unit mode of grams , there is no decimal in the result display , and since the precision is 1g , it measures each gram . 
lol , i did n't know for sure so i timed it for you - 3 mintues ... 
the smallest amount it will weigh is 0.1oz or 1 g 
no issues with rubber feet . i keep it stored on its side when not in use . 
6 in . by 9 in . by 1.2 in . thick . tells you exactly on the product page in amazon . 
the label on mine says made in china . 
it is 11lb or 5kg 
10th . 
yes , it does . it offers pounds and ounces , grams , milliliters , and fluid ounces . 
no but it will hold the display reading so you can still tell the weight . 
no it does n't measure under a gram . 
this item is made from polycarbonate , bpa is the key building block of polycarbonate . the answer is , yes , this item does contain bpa , the advertisement is misleading to say the least . i am returning mine . 
harder plastic , hopefully lasts longer . also does not stain easily from tomatoes being heated . 
i personally would never place any plastic or acrylic item on a grill . its going to melt , stink and be toxic . 
yes 
yes it is , the problem i had with this item was it retained to much heat . 
just one ( 1 ) . the quality is excellent but the price is pretty steep . you can pay a fraction of the price for a bpa free cover at bed bath and beyond but the quality is not the same . plus the one at bbb has a smaller cover included as well . i think the price was under $ 10 . 
since it is essentially plastic , i would n't try it . 
hi there . , yes the material is bpa free . this is why it 's a little higher in price than our competitors . happy christmas 
hi . i do n't think it is . let me check with my manufacturer 
i would guess polypropylene . 
yes , it does . in fact , it 's much more compact than it looks in the photo . i also have the breville juicer and the hurom is overall less space-consuming . 
no - it is strictly a juice . if you are really interested in juicing then this is your unit . if you want blended fun drinks then get a blender like vita mix . 
yes it does . it comes with a course and fine strainer that is used inside the device . it also come with a plastic brush and a metal wire brush , as well as two different plastic bowl-like containers ( one for catch the liquid and one for catching the pulp ) . it also comes with a juicing recipe book . it 's a fantastic juicer and i ca n't believe how much more juice it produces as compared to the centerfuge types . 
110 
what 's the drum bowl ? ? 
do n't buy this , it is not worth it . you ca n't juice anything that is n't hard .

joyoung dj13u-d08sg is a fully automatic home kitchen appliance which uses a new 3d heating system without a heating tube and instead applies heat to the entire body for more even cooking . this is joyoung 2013 newest flag ship high end top model . no , it is full stainless steel design . there is no plastic that contacts the food directly . 
yes . i use it a lot . 
yes , i do that twice a day for my soymilk . no problem at all . it 's a great soymilk maker and i love it ! 
this verry good for make soy mill i 'm buy one and this one i buy for my brother in sc , thanks amzon can shipping to all people and family on world . 
well , i guess the bean paste is too thick for this machine to make . consider this machine will boil heat the combination of crushed beans , sufficient water is a key element . too less water will cause demage to the pot itself . i made soy milk with this machine and it works pretty good , every time after the soy milk is filtered out there are some gounded beans left , that is very thick , like a paste . but that is a by-product . 
ca n't answer specifically but the one i got from amazon a few months ago looks exactly as pictured on amazon . 
i never try it , but i think it can . 
it ran on 110 . 
email joyoungusa @ hotmail.com to find the answer . 
no not . barely warm . 
it comes with the bracket . the mounting can be challenging , given the template ( paper ) provided , that you are supposed to hang somehow on the bottom of the upper cabinet . if you had an old ge , you might be able to use your existing bracket ( assuming you are replacing a unit ) . i used mine , it was the same - exactly . the upper holes for the hanging bolts were different - and they need to be right on - very challenging . if you use a laser , it helps a lot to get the alignment correct . 
29 7 8 '' wide x 16 '' high x 15 1 2 '' deep ( plus additional 2 1 4 '' for the handle ) 
the menus are improved . i posted a few pics that should give you an idea . 
yes . two simple ways are to : 1. press the `` add 30 sec '' button . each press adds 30 seconds . 2. press the `` cooking menu '' button and then select `` cook by time '' . you can then rotate the knob to select the amount of time . 
the unit does have an attached cord . the only thing underneath that needs to be replaced are the grease filters for the ventilation of your cooking surface . 
yes an aluminum filter that can be washed 
lite in microwave on opening . adjustable lites facing down for cooking on range . 
it seems like the exhaust can be modified but google the manuel to make sure . mine was a standard exhaust up install . 
yes it does and very easy install in top front of unit . 
dear sandra , the microwave has the following dimensions : dimensions and weight product width : 29 3 4 '' product depth : 15 1 2 '' product height : 16 1 2 '' cavity width : 20 7 8 '' cavity depth : 14 1 2 '' cavity height : 10 7 8 '' net weight : 57 lbs . approximate shipping weight : 63 lbs . the microwave does come with the mounting kit . thank you

it is n't a varnish . they use mineral oil to make them shine and seal them . after time you will need to use mineral oil to redo it to seal it after washing them and cooking them . i love mine have had no issues . i will say i am having to do the mineral oil in a few days . i do use them more than any other cooking utensils . 
i want to say the slightest little bit , but please save yourself the trouble and buy another brand . i got these , opened them and the went right in the trash ! waste of money . full of splinters ! 
i do n't know if they are usa made . but they are certainly durable and worth the price . 
i 'm pretty sure the package said to hand wash them . 
the set i received is unfinished . 
i washed mine before using them the first time . i have never used any kind of oil on them . 
this travel pillow is smaller than a standard pillow . the approximate dimensions are 16 '' x 12 '' x 4 '' . 
there is a difference , the less expensive pillow only has a rectangular shape cooling gel patch on one side of the memory foam pillow but the other pillow has the cool gel infused throughout the entire memory foam - which is the one i would recommend . 
16 '' x 12 '' 
i put it in the washer and dryer . i washed it in hot water ( i have bad allergies ) , and dried on a regular setting , and it was fine . 
i have n't looked for one , but i do use a travel pillowcase over this pillow to help keep it clean . i change it when i change my other pillowcases . 
a very pretty blue 
this pillow and the shredded latex pillow you posted on are both filled pillows but they will feel different . latex is more `` bouncy '' and the nanobead pillow is designed for motion isolation so your head can hit the pillow and be completely cradled . if you like the idea of latex but do n't want a solid pillow instead of shredded , the zoned latex pillow is another good option . 
this pillow is approximately 16 '' x 12 '' x 4 '' 
this pillow weighs approximately 2.5 lbs . 
the dimensions of this pillow are approximately 16 x 12 x 3.5 
yes . i did exactly that . just opened up an end , took out some filling and sewed it back up . warning ... the filling goes everywhere and sticks to everything . but , it worked . 
this pillow and the nanobead pillow are both filled pillows but they will feel different . latex is more `` bouncy '' and the nanobead pillow is designed for motion isolation so your head can hit the pillow and be completely cradled . 
about 1.5 lbs 
everything ! ! do n't buy these cloths , buy the original mint cloths . these pick up a fraction of the dirt that the mint cloths pick up . i feel ripped off buying these . do not buy ! ! they are rubbish ! ! i let the mint wipe my kitchen floor with one of these cloths . i then immediately repeated the mopping cycle with an original mint cloth . even though this cloth had already gone over the kitchen floor once , the original mint cloth going over the same area immediately afterward picked up much more dirt . i 've got photos to prove it . these cloths from irobot are really a cheap imitation of the original and they should be ashamed of themselves for letting the mint product go downhill after buying out evolution . 
have used the swifter disposable cloths for sweeping dusting . they work just fine , but like the device better for wet mopping . generally just use the blue cloth it came w and others like i ordered off amazon . they wash well in my washing machine . 
brushing these is enough , i think you do n't need to wash these with clorx . 
the are the microfiber clothes that you wet yourself and attach to the i-robot brava rechargeable floor mopping machine . 
yes - i think it would work for that 
i would n't think so . the braava manual states the blue textured cloths are for mopping , white cloths are for dry sweeping . 
no 
i only use hot water to dampen the cloth rather than chemicals , but uou could also use a wood floor cleaner that you would spray on the cloth to dampen it if you 'd like . 
it works with a european version . 
yes 
three years from the date of purchase , the product is warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship . 
it has a 10 hour auto shutoff . many are not aware it has an auto shutoff but guessing that is because they do n't keep it on for 10 hours ! ! it just clicks off after 10 hours 
you may need an adapter for european electricty . have two - really great product . 
the cord is long . mine ( t f ) is about 12 ft from the pad to the control , and 7 ft from the control to the wall plug . it is designed to go under the bed , and the control can rest on a side table . 
yes 
ac ... plugs into regular wall outlet . works great to warm lower legs and feet , depending on where you position it on your bed . 
no 
nope , mine just has low , medium and high . 
perhaps they have changed something but ours does not have a red light . perhaps the flashing red means it is heating . does it heat up ? did you try a different setting rather than on high ? i 'd try to leave it on a couple hours to see what happens . if it does not go off , then malfunction . 
the frame will definitely hold up for several months . your guest may need to replace the mattress at some point or possible double up and use two . but over all the product should hold up fine . my mom has been sleeping on it for 3 months and she weighs about 160. she loves it and finds it very comfortable . it is the size of a twin bed so that is something else to consider . when we bought it we thought it was a full size and it is n't . 
no 
yes ebay , bought 1 
i do n't know if the mattress is available for purchase alone . it works very well on the frame that it comes with but might not work as comfortably with a frame that has springs . i am contemplating the purchase of a second fold away bed like the one i originally purchased because i am so pleased with the first one . 
i never looked for a cover , but probably easy to make one . i would use a king size sheet & go from there . 
no 
yes , we have washed it twice 
do n't know exact limit ... but we 've had a guest sleep on it that is probably 250. they loved it ! we frequently all sit on it to play video games which exceeds the 250 lbs total . it seems very durable . 
do n't really know , but the cot fit nicely inside . we saved the box to slide over the top when we store the cot . 
it 's a tad bit smaller than a twin size , but the quality is outstanding ! 
yes . while they are different brands , we 've found that this frame is compatible with these headboard brackets : http : www.amazon.com structures-highrise-headboard-footboard-bracket dp b00bj4vkqy ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1396299952 & sr=8-1 & keywords=highrise+headboard+brackets 
i have the twin xl , it fits inside a wooden bedframe with headboard footboard . the metal frame itself from lucid does not have holes bolts to attach a headboard directly to it . 
no . made by structures highrise 
hey there ! i have used the frame for about a month , and there is no squeaking yet . 
have not put an air matteress on it might puncture the matteress 
not sure of dimensions but am sure it will fit in the back of an suv . not small , but not that big . 
that would depend on the width and depth of the space between the headboard & footboard , and from side to side . get those measurements and compare them to the measurements provided in the product description . if you have an existing frame with rails , you may want to consider adding extra slats between the rails to support a foam mattress ( if that 's your intent ) which would eliminate the need for the metal platform . 
yes , they are safe . i have hardwood floors as well and the feet have a rubber type cover on them . 
about six inches 
i hope i understand your question correctly . i will answer like this . i bought a double ( full ) bed mattress and bought this platform in the same size . this platform came in two twin bed size halves ( i 'm guessing that 's what they are ) , with push-on rubber clamps that snap them together very securely . let me know if this is not clear . but bottom line is buy one of these for the size mattress you plan to use . 
yes . very soft . i am very pleased with the product . 
nope , same size . cant really compress . 
it 's the size you see 
the blanket is 60 '' l x 45 '' w it is a really good size , i even cuddle up with too ! 
not super plush , but i 've washed it several times and it 's still soft . my son sleeps with it every night . 
46 '' x 60 '' 
the current image is wrong ! ! i requested that amazon change it to the correct image . it has 4 tmnt characters and it says good times . they will hopefully change the image shortly . 
must be a typo ... it was a tmnt blanket when i ordered it . 
it may be the wrong picture . but i oordered the same cover and got the ninja turtles one but i had the correct picture 
eco bags are designed to seal with clear packing tape . we do n't include this tape and most people have a roll in their home which saves you a few dollars on our award winning mattress cover ! 
thanks for the great question ! our award winning eco mattress bags are designed to encase one unit and seal with tape . if you have a mattress and a box spring , you will need to buy two eco mattrsss bags . if you have any more questions , we are here for you , so you do n't have to stress about your mattress , we 've got you covered ! ! !

pakistan . 
yes , exactly . 
no zipper . it 's just a regular pillow case with a straight edge ; no fold over . 
they are just plain white pillow cases . 
yes . we tye dyed them earlier in the summer and they still look good after many washings . they may look a little more faded than a 100 % cotton t-shirt would , but as long as you really soak them with the dye and follow washing instructions , they should turn out fine . 
maybe 2 '' fabric feels awful against your face . 
we use ours for about 800 sf and it works very well at medium . 
no - the humidifier does not take filters , and the tank is mold and mildew resistant . i 've been using the older model for a year , and have n't had any trouble with bacteria mold . 
have always used cold tap water , but i would think distilled water would be better , and yes it would last longer , and you may not need to clean as often . 
the 4600 is the latest model . difference that i can tell is that the 4600 has three specific levels to choose the amount of vapor produced . the 4500 has an infinitely variable controller . i have had the 4500 and now have the 4600. of the two , i prefer the 4500 vapor controller because in my application i do n't want much vapor . on the other hand , it is nice to have three specific levels . another difference is the form factor . the 4600 is a little higher and not as deep as the 4500. either way you can not go wrong . 
i remove the mist nozzle from the unit , by prying it out , then i soak the nozzle in a cup of 1 part bleach and 4 parts water for a couple of hours , rinse thoroughly with cold water , if still not clean , then i use disk detergent with a small brush to remove the remaining particles . 
i have n't , but i did n't read a warning against it in the manual . 
since you ca n't use cleaners i make sure i clean every other day with paper towels and the provided brush for the silver disk . once you have a build up i do use a soft brush on the white plastic parts , , but not on the silver disk . they sell an additive for hard water build up , which may be your problem . i hope this helps . 
yes , there is an insert for your hands . 
how loud is the gurgulling ... .mine is just about heard 
this is what the manufacturer says on their faq 's about the white dust : why is there white dust on my furniture ? if water is especially hard or has a high mineral content , you may notice white dust around the unit . white dust is not a problem it is from the minerals in the water that form the dust . the humidifier evaporates the water and then the white dust is left in the unit , not sent out into the air . if bothersome , use distilled water or you can purchase one of our decalcification filters ( fltdc ) to help with the problem . i personally do not have this issue . here 's a link to the faq 's as well : http : www.guardiantechnologies.com faqs 
we blend spinach for green smoothies every day -- and it totally pulverizes the leaves . from looking at comparison videos , the versa probably takes 20-30 seconds longer than a vitamix to achieve the same final result when blending greens , but i will happily save the $ 200-300 and stick with my versa . 
my humble opinion : my wife wanted a vitamix . i was skeptic because of the high price and not having heard of that brand before . so i searched for all high-power blenders available in amazon , sorted by price , ignored the ones with few reviews , and read reviews carefully . this , and the costliest ninja , were the only ones with no complaints of them stopping working after a few months . since my wife did not trust the ninja , and i trust oster as brand , i went for this . we 're very happy with this choice : it grinds everything , and the price was right . 
no you can not . most high-powered , high-torque machines will be that way . the drive line is all metal for strength and durability , and the bearings are sealed . it also eliminates the leaks , and misalignment issues caused by improperly assembled removable blades . the down-side is it can be a bit tricky to clean . 
it makes less noise than your typical non-professional blender but it does make quite a bit of noise , nothing too significant . yes , it can make nut butter , peanut butter is easy but almond butter is a bit more complicated to do . 
my wife has used it to easily make salsa , soup , green smoothies , and nut butter . she has n't tried to make dough with it yet . 
apple seeds are reported to contain cyanide , so best to remove before putting in blender . 
i 've not had that experience either . i do know that the instructions said not to run the blender continuously for more than 5 minutes ( i think ) . maybe you 're running it for too long ? 
the bottom portion of the side walls make a 45-degree slope down to the floor of the pitcher , which is flat under the blades . 
yes . i just called oster a couple days ago to ask about replacing my jar under warranty because it was leaking . no questions asked , new jar is being shipped to me at no charge . and they told me to discard my current jar . 
i have the short pitcher versa and it pours well into large openings like glasses or jars . the spout is about 2 inches across , so you might encounter some problems with pouring into 3 inch openings or less . the spout is also square ( ish ) and tends to retain a drop or so to decorate your counter . hope this helps . 
i really do not know . i googled `` bpa plastic bags '' seems bpa is used in most plastic . still like i said i do not know , there is nothing on the bags or packaging that are bpa free . the label does say they are `` eco-friendly packaging for online sales only '' 
one bundle of 100 ... a pain to fill and tie though 
yes 
the ones i received were only 10 '' long but they make huge pops . yes , you can hold it and pour with the other hand , you will need a funnel or baster to do so . 
2 inch x 10 inch 
the package recommended to tie them off or use a twist tie . the plastic may be too thin for heat sealing . 
sadley ... they do not say anywhere on packaging where they are made..say `` eco friendly ' ... .not impressed ! 
i am sorry , but i completely forget to check that . 
i would n't , only because of the type of plastic and the fact that you have liquid and air in the sleeve , may pop it open ! works great just tying them up , make sure your knot is tight or you will end up with leakage . 
approximately 12x2 inches and can hold about 3 4 cup liquid with room to tie the top . 
yrs , we brought them and they work greate 
that 's what gos in the thing three 500= 1500 w 
yes it will still work but it will not put out as much heat as having all 3 bulbs working . 
each edenpure is different . check to see which one you have before you order . 
the bulbs are 500 watt apiece 1500 watt total . you need 3 bulbs 
these bulbs match perfectly ! 
i dont think a warrenty comes with this bulb kit , but your heater should have come with a pretty good warrenty if you kept your reciept . 
yes there is a warranty on these we just bought some 
i only got two years out of the two top bulbs the bottom bulb is original . 
sorry cindy , i have no idea . i 'm trying to remember how i found out about the kit in the first place ; i spoke with someone on the phone who advised me about it . oh yes , i went directly to edenpure first , then to one of their on-line reps who advised me about the kit . you might try that route . good luck , susan 
yes . 100 % silicone . no fillers . -- kitchie 
i have used them just sitting on a cookie sheet and the result was excellent . i do n't know that it would be appropriate to put into a muffin tin . 
these are the same size as the cupcake papers you can get in any grocery store .

there are 55 filters in a plastic bag and cost is per plastic bag . these filters are a almost square piece of filter paper with 5 holes , one in the center and one each at each corner . grounds may still get in the coffee by being forced out if the brewing is to fast and you use fine ground coffee such as drip grind . wetting the filter first helps the grounds stay in the filter better . if you grind your own coffee with a course grind then that helps keep the grounds out of the coffee also . 
i believe it would . filters measure 9 1 8 x 9 1 2 inches , that is a good size filter . 
yes , plus shipping ! ! i keep trying to find them locally ; meanwhile , i 'm using tissues ! 
the package does not say unbleached . manufactured by rockline industries , po box 1007 , sheboygan , wi 53081 . 
yes indeed , they will fit just fine ! 
i am not sure . my stove-top pyrex percolator is a 12-cupper , and when i `` wrap '' a filter around the filter cage spindle all is well even if i put in 10 coffee measures of coffee ( i like my coffee strong ) . the packaging for the brew-rite 's do n't say . if this is really large percolator ( like what they put out at neighborhood meetings ) , you could try it , and merely lay the filter `` flat '' in the filter cage with the middle hole over the spindle . most important is to cover the drip holes ( the ones in the bottom of the filter cage ) . brew rites will probably do this . still think you 're better off trying to find round `` flat '' filters that fit a 30-cupper . 
mine has never shut off due to overheating . the only safety shut off i know about on the unit is a spring loaded switch on the bottom . make sure you can press it down and it springs back then try placing it on a hard surface , like the floor , to make sure the switch is pressing down and try it . if this does n't work then the problem is inside the unit which means proceed at your own risk . 
no , it does n't . it does not blow with a fan , it radiates the heat . excellent heater , we have three of them : ) 
have had ours for 5 years , perfectly satisfied with unit . recently purchased another one for downstairs . 
that 's where i use mine . it has a safety button on the bottom so if it falls over it shuts off . still , i would n't put it on the tub ledge unless you like to live dangerously . 
there are no user serviceable parts in this heater , nor are any for sale . replacing heating tubes would require a trip back to the factory . if there is a manufacturer defect get a replacement unit under warranty . 
the cord on ours is five feet . 
no 
no 
do n't know the exact meaurements but it is for small rooms . 
the center portion of the cabinet is metal , the rest is plastic 
i poured the pellets into a similarly sized cloth bag as the final piece . 
these beads are about 1 4 '' ( one quarter of an inch ) in diameter , and are all uniform in size . i really do n't know about the size of the beads in your snowglobe . i hope this helped . 
i used one bag to refill an old bean bag chair . that worked fine and it is like new . if you are filling it up from empty , i would get three bags . i am not really familiar with a hot lips chair , mine was an old standard roundish one 
2 bags would make the pillow fluffy again . 3 bags would make it firmer . 
mine did . just tried to fill a bag and they stuck to everything but i 'm guessing it would depend on how much static was around ; ) 
one bag of the bean bag fill should be enough 10 x 30 inch bag . 
you will need to order the larger bag this size is just a booster for already full bean bag chairs 
you can , but you can probably empty out the old pieces and put the new `` fresh '' filler in their place . i would assume they would take up more space and fill out your bag . notice , i did purchase two of them . good luck . 
teenage is an age , not a size ... that 's relative at best ... it 's probably 4 or 5 bags to fill the average size bag that you would purchase from the store . you 'd be better off buying a bag from target , dumping it out , and putting it in your teenage bag . 
yes 
hello , this is directly out of the manual under components and features . `` made of high-quality , heavy-gauge , stainless steel , all cooking takes place in the pressure cooker pot . '' and on the bottom of the pot is says inox-stainless steel . hope this helps . 
yes 
hand washing only is recommended for this unit . i have never really had a problem keeping mine clean . 
you brown your meats first with high heat and olive oil . you can then use a paper towel to remove the extra oil , and finish slow cooking the meat with what else you are adding . do n't be afraid to experiment . these newer pressure cookers are a lot safer . enjoy ! 
the cayenne pressure cooker by fagor is made in spain . karen eurostoves 
i believe the difference is color and the handle . i like this handle better . 
it 's a large stainless basket with a handle . being that the pot is 8 qt , i would estimate the basket at a minimum of 4 qt . 
no , it is made in china 
rather than press the meat or any other food type button , press the + button until you reach 75 . 
yes , it comes with a tray . 
hi loving life , it is 1000w . if you have any other questions do n't hesitate to ask . thanks gowise usa 
no there is no delay start option . 
i have the 4 -qt size one and no , there is no specific button for canning . 
it is a piece of junk ! ! i sent 2 back 
it comes in 4 quarts 6 quarts and 8 quarts 
so far , mine has been fine but i did read a few reviews that others had this problem before i got the hang of it , had trouble closing it and figuring out the steam non-steam valve and it would not even go on but subsequently - after getting help from my grand-daughter it is fine . is there a problem with closing and or the gasket - is it clean ? 
? ? ? works just as advertised . just like a 6 qt crockpot . & browns meats just like a pan . my only semi-negative comment is that the top is n't specifically stated can go in the dishwasher . but i put it on the top dishwasher rack and ( so far ) no problems . . 
nothing significant , but despite it 's size you wo n't get two mugs worth . less is not always more . 
no . the filter basket assembly is partly plastic with a very fine metal mesh . the seal on the press feels like silicone . other than discoloration , i have not had any problems with it or think it is deteriorating in any way . 
those figures are correct . it is 18 ounces and actually 32 ounces . 
yes it dies get easier , and you will get used to it . 
it 's a canadian company . 
yes ! 
just a few more data points . the medium has two lines the lower is just under 20oz ( about 19 oz ) and the upper is 24oz . it 's about 30oz all the way to the top ( where the seam between the inner and outer are welded ) . ( measured by weight with no grinds nor filter . ) note that this does n't seem to match the faq ( http : espro.ca faq-espro-press ) which notes 600ml 450ml ( 20.2oz 15.2oz ) for the upper lower marks . i presume the difference is assuming the grinds take up a volume of ~4oz . 
no , most cook top pressure cookers reach 15lb inch squared . this cooker is programmed to shut off the cooking element when the temperature would potentially create a pressure of 12.7lb inch squared . but and this is a big but , this cooker will not overuse the cooking energy , expel nutrients as steam and does not require constant monitoring . it is also very quiet and shuts off cooking automatically and maintains a warm heating . it is not perfect and is light duty but very handy . 
yes , one year 
get the 6 quart if you cook for a family . i got the 4 quart and it 's just enough for my husband and i with a little left over for lunch the next day . 
lid can be opened on slow cook . can not open on pressure cook , unless you release the pressure , then open . 
no no no ! : ) no home pressure cooker is made to do pressure frying and to do so is dangerous ( google it ) . as you know , pressure only begins building in the cooker after the water boils . oil 's boiling point ( aka smoking point ) , however , is much higher than that of water . at normal atmospheric pressure , water boils at 212f , but most oils smoke ( boil ) at 350f-450f -- that 's 150f-250f degrees higher , even double the temperature of boiling water ! and that temperature is even higher when pressurized inside the cooker . http : en.wikipedia.org wiki pressure_frying the major problem is that home pressure cookers are not made to withstand that heat . the rubber silicone gasket , for example , may melt . so might some of the glue or plastic parts touching metal parts . if crucial parts melt while cooking , you may have an explosion from the internal pressure . basically , pressure frying using a home pressure cooker is a disaster waiting to happen . that 's why manuals will warn against it . 
you need to grease the bottom . do n't think its non stick , even they say it is . like the frying pan and the egg . it will stick if not coated . 
yes , it warms very well 
6 3 8 deep and 8 3 8 diamater 
i 've used all the features and i 've never had a problem . i really like it . 
i 've only cooked rice in my pressure cooker once and i used a 1-2 ratio ( rice to water ) . it took about 8 minutes and i did not add water to the bottom . just put the rice and water in the removable pot , move the dial to 'pressure ' and set timer at 8 minutes ... it was perfectly cooked .

if there are springs , i do n't feel them ! we 've had this sofa for about 5 months and we love it ! ! ! it is nice and soft . i would definitely recommend it . no complaints ! 
they are velcoed on-easy to clean but they stay put . 
it is a popular upholstery material , it is a natural leather material .

there a darker mauve and yes small is mauve next size light brown alternate in color there are really pretty i 'm very happy with them my kitchen is cafe decor and they go great 
yes , all the lids have a rubber seal on them . 
the brown 1 does look bigger , maybe because it 's sitting up higher . 
it holds up great and i washed it in cold water ! 
i 'm sorry i can not answer the question since i gave it as a gift and the girl using it places it on top of the bed ( without a comforter or quilt inside ) so as not to get too hot . good luck . 
coral . peachy coral .

the dress is printed onto the cover , so it 's not like a child will be wearing it . that being said , my daughter was a tiny ( 30 pounds ) five year old when i bought it for her , and it 's adorable over her . 
white . very very white . scary in a kids room , but we have n't had a problem keeping them clean and looking good . 
no - it has button closures at and but no way to secure te comforter inside . with thay said it is my daughters favorite and hasnt been a problem . 
its just a duvet cover and pillow case . 
i put it in the washer and dryer 
1 pillowcase , i wish there were 2 because the pillowcase is kind of ratty looking now . i 'm not sure of the size . i bought a twin size insert on amazon to fit into it , and it fits perfectly . 
i returned the item upon receiving it because it was very thin and i thought it was n't worth the price . i have sheets that are thicker and better quality . i do n't remember the thread count , but because i was planning on using sheets underneath my son 's duvet , i was n't too concerned with that . sorry i could n't be more help . 
i do not know the measurements off hand but they fit my kiddos ' twin beds like any other traditional twin size set . i bought the duvet twin comforter insert from ikea and it fits perfectly . i am pretty sure they list the measurements on their site . hope this helps ! 
hi ... my charge lasts for several days and that is after using this little appliance in my 4,000 sq ft home ... it is great thus far ... but i have only had it for about two weeks ... i highly recommend this product . it is great ... especially on hard wood surfaces ... great picking up pet hair ... i love it thus far ! ! ! ! ! i think that one should use it until the charge expires ... then recharge it ... do n't keep it charging all of the time ... charge it ... use it until it expires ... then recharge it . do not keep it plugged in ... 
yes . it works great on wood , tile , and carpet . 
v2700g works very well 
i do n't know as all i have are laminated floors , tile and carpet . i have had no trouble on the laminated . 
yes the charger is included i do n't know the v 's but it charges completely from nearly dead in about 4 hours . 
i leave mine in for about 24 hours . a friend who has a day care and uses it everyday leaves it plugged in all the time . 
on hard surface , yes . not so good on carpet . 
sorry do not know the answer to that one 
it comes with a ni-mh battery . everything you need is with it . you have to put the sweeper handle together and click it on the sweeper itself then plug the sweeper in with enclosed charger for 7 hours to initial use . just follow all the directions as best as possible and the battery should last for years . my older one of 8 years still has the original battery . hope this helps . 
i know shark does sell them but it would have to be charged . best check with them . 
yes , it was made of china . 
yes , you can . you can put the brewed tea into this water dispenser container and store in the fridge . 
thank you for your inquiry . no you ca n't it 's a ceramic water dispenser . 
thank you for your inquiry . it works for 1.5 gal . equal to 192 ounce capacity . 
the legs are screwed into the table from the bottom ... the hardware is included but the holes for the screws are not marked or pre-drilled on the table . you have to measure in order to center the legs . 
no , it would n't especially if it were to get rained on ... .legs would rust and top would warp .

this table does come with 2 legs . thank you for your inquiry . beyond stores . 888-349-6096 
use it straight out of the box . put the bowl on , if using it , and turn on . when 0 is displayed , add your food . if you are n't using bowl , remove it , then turn on . 0 will appear ... then weigh your food . 
first , let me say that i love this scale . it serves by needs perfectly . the spout on the bowl is great for those soft foods or liquids you may want to weigh . secondly , my product arrived well packaged and was clean . i did the standard `` wash '' cause it 's new and before using , then used it . however , i do not put in the dishwasher . i can not attest that if there were issues , they have been addressed and fixed , but would hope so . i 'd take my chances you can always return with a note . ardis , desmoines , ia 
no it does not . but the weight constantly changes if the bowl is empty or not . you just have to take the bowl off and it resets itself . once i had an empty bowl on it and it said it was -37 pounds . another time it said 2 spoons of sugar were 200 grams . after removing the bowl it showed a different weight . i actually never got a correct weight from this scale at all . 
not sure about the bpa , but you could definitely use a different bowl , then it is just like any other scale . the bowl makes a good storage cover . 
truthfully i have n't the slightest idea . 
i do n't think that 's necessary . the scale allows you to set to `` zero '' so the weight of the bowl is negated . when i tested the scale for my review , i used prepackaged items in my kitchen and allowed for slight variance and i found the scale to be within reasonable tolerances . unless you 're using it for another purpose than portion control or measuring in the kitchen i think you 'll be fine . 
it can weigh at 10th of grams ... like 1.6 grams . instead of 1 gram then 2 grams . 
i do believe it has a one-year warranty . 
i have n't had a problem with it shutting off before i am finished weighing my food . i usually wind up shutting it off manually , so i do not have the answer for you . i have another brand at my other residence which always shuts off in the middle of my weighing my food , this one does not do that . 
maybe you have to change battery . that happens when the battery is low . 
i did n't have any problems with sheets . they fit well . 
no . once you unpack it , it 's heavy and thick . 
it 's a regular fill size mattress . we use full size sheets for it . 
i bought the dream foam mattress in the 10 inch version . i have a cranky back and find it difficult to get comfortable . this mattress did the trick for me . i would call it medium firm with just enough give for sleeping on your side . its wonderful . 
the mattress comes extremely compressed . so the box is about 15 '' x 15 '' x the width of the mattress . i was surprised with how compressed the mattress was but when you open it up and let it stand overnight , it takes and holds its shape rather well . 
my daughter sleeps comfortably on this mattress and has not complained of overheating while sleeping on it .

we let ours sit for 4 hours ... .not even ... and it was fine . 
yes and yes . one of the beds we use a similar mattress on is from ikea and has a slat base . even works there . 
it comes rolled . box is about 18 '' square . wo n't fit in a car trunk though . 
no . 
i have n't noticed that yet , but i 've only used it in the winter . it does n't seem to get too hot now . 
only had this one for about 18 months . the original foam mattress we purchase is 5+ years old and shows no sign of wear .

the information on my box is that it is a `` product of taiwan '' . 
i have n't had that problem , or any other problems with mine . 
you can get one from bodum . they have similar sizes . 
not true , in my case . still looks like new . 
i make coffee everyday and it has n't stained or cracked yet . i ca n't say it 'll last forever , especially if you drop it ! 
glass 
glass 
yes you can . i replaced mine with bodum 's standard cup after the original broke . 
why does this matter ? it 's a great product . 
i have been looking at these same bowls and found the description on amazon lacking . i found info about these on a competitor 's site . the bowls are 18 10 stainless and are dishwasher-safe . the plastic lids are bpa-free and are safe on the top shelf of the dishwasher . hope that helps you out . 
to me they are sturdy , but not awkward to handle , if that 's what you 're asking . the metal does n't flex or give , but they are not heavy in weight . that is , they are lighter than the equivalent size glass mixing bowl . 
small one has a tight fit , the large one has a loose fit , and the medium one is in-between . i can mix a salad with the medium one safely . : ) 
i dont use my dishwasher so i do n't know . sorry 
i have n't put mine in freezer so i ca n't answer that ! 
lids are plastic . the entire inner surface of the bowl is stainless steel . i do n't know about the outer non-slip base , but it appears to be of a silicone-type material that makes the bowl stay in place on the counter . 
i have silicone mats for baking that are safe to 500f in the oven , so if these are indeed silicone i do n't think the heat would bother them . it 's possible that the glue keeping the silicone attached could come loose , though . 
no rubber bottoms , which work very well to anchor the bowl on a counter . they do n't move at all . 
sorry no they are not made in the u.s.a. but i still think these are a good purchase . the bowls have interior measure markings and lids that seal tight . i am positive my daughter will get lots of good use out of this set . 
big bigger and biggest 
7 l 2 h x 9 l 2 w x 5 l 2 d. top removal tray is 4 l 2 h. i love this organizer . it holds a lot of make up and brushes . 
definitely wo n't fit the naked ... but i stand my 3 naked palettes up in the slots on the the top back ! 
top is 9 1 2 ww x 5 '' d x 3 1 2 h bottom is . 9 1 2 w x 5 12 d x 4 1 2 h it is well made and works well . it has two side by side small drawers and two large drawers , plenty of room for my cosmetics . 
1 1 2 in tall by 51 2 in the 2 small drawers and 1 1 2 by 10 in the 2 long drawers . good quality and sturdy . 
yes , this heater is ul approved . also , works very well . my favorite feature aside from the timer , is the auto shut off . if this heater is not sitting in it 's upright position it turns off immediately . oh ya , the fan mode actually works as well . worth every dime . 
yes 
yes it will . 
6 feet 
yes , i think it is quiet 
no . item uses a standard 110 120v outlet . 
i believe not metal though the humidity inherent in most bathrooms does not work well with this product . a shame , too , because it 's capacity is well suited for such a space 
yes , it works with an extension cord . 
unfortunately ( or fortunately ) , it is not very loud at all since the fan does not generate much output . 
no . 
no , it 's very smooth and soft - more like a microfiber . we love it ! 
my dog urinated on this blanket a month after i purchased it . what i did was just wash it by itself in normal detergent in the washer on a delicate setting and then i put it in the dryer by itself also on the delicate setting . i was worried maybe the inside of the blanket would get uneven and warped but it did n't at all - it all stayed in place perfectly fine and the stain came right out . 
it 's a pure bright white . it is just amazing when it 's all together ! people see it and they want one ! ca n't go wrong - whatever color you pick . 
comforter , skirt , 2 shams , 3 pillows 
yes 
it is good to buy a size larger than the bed . the full was too small for our full bed . we bought the queen for the full and the full for the twin . the full for the twin will be luxurious and spilling down to the floor . if you do not like that messy look , and do n't want things on the floor -- find another comforter . you wo n't hang it on the bed as in the photo . these are cut long and skinny . hang it crosswise over the beds . 
comforter : ) 
orders are shipped within 2 business days and delivery are made within 6 business days to lower 48 us states , physical addresses . please email us directly for more information . 
the bed skirt would be too big for sure . if you do n't mind the comforter blanket touching the floor then it 'd be fine . i have a queen and the comforter blanket hangs roughly 6 inches off both sides of the mattress , so on a full it 'll probably hang lower , maybe to the ground . still beautiful though . 
yes - 2 shams that cover two pillows . 
its a little over a foot . 
i do n't see why not . 
the horizontal support is six inches from the bottom of the legs , so i do n't see why you would n't be able to as long as you 're handy with a hacksaw . do n't expect your warranty to be valid afterwards though ... 
it works for our queen size pillow topped mattress and box springs , and the frame is very solid . there is no hangover for the mattress 
no , a boxspring is not needed . but , then again , comfort is a personal issue ... 
q 60x80x14 
helllo ashlee this frame is designed to hold 4000 lbs of evenly distributed weight 
no , it is just the metal platform . 
you will need to get a quote from a carrier like fedex or ups . thanks 
this foundation is not suitable for waterbed . this would be a better option for waterbeds . http : www.amazon.com classic-brands-platform-mattress-foundation dp b00ua62wxw ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1429792905 & sr=8-1 & keywords=europa+platform+bed 
no it looks just like that ! u do need large pillows to slide in cases tho 
i 'm not sure if you can order drapes that match seperatly . they are not included in the set that i received . 
i 'm unsure of what material is it is filled with . it felt paper like to me so i sent it back . 
i have about 6 inches of memory foam on top of my mattress and with that the comforter does n't quite reach the box spring . 
it does n't say on the tag and i do n't remember what the pkg said 
2 shams are included . also included are 3 decorative pillows , a bed-skirt and the comforter . 
it is machine washable . 
the comforter was thick but not necessarily soft as it is not made of a knit . we do not use it to sleep with though . we use it for decor purposes and fold it up at night . the appearance is what i was looking for and it definitely met my desired appearance . 
washes just fine 
yes , it is machine washable . i do n't have a large washer so i have to take it to a laundromat or use my friend 's front load machine . 
we ship via usps priority mail for apo address and the rates are much more than ups ground shipping . 
we are currently sold out of the queen size . 
you get two pillow covers for the big ones and then you get the round pillow , small rectangular one and a square one ! its a really cute set all you need is a comforter to fill in the duvet 
buttons and it 's such a cheap fabric i threw it away ... i do n't recommend u buying it ... looks pretty but feels so cheap 
no idea . it 's polyester and hot and sweaty and i do n't recommend it . 
actually , i got this for a high four poster bed so i 'm not using the bed skirt . to answer your question , i checked the skirt . i could barely see the dark cherry side panel through the fabric . for the price it looks nicer than i expected . i could have spent more but i have pets that occasionally can be rough on bedding . i 'd rather not have to replace the $ 200 duvet i liked but not much more than the chezmoi . 
it comes with three decorative pillows and two pillow cases . it 's a really gorgeous set . i would recommend . 
i washed it and it did very well , however , the pillow cases change color . the material inside the pillow case case the outer color to have a cream look . we followed directions on how to wash and dry it on the tags , but still they still come out cream . so it looks kinda odd , with a white duvet and a cream-ish color pillow case . but overall we never regret buying it , very comfy in the cold . 
it 's definitely a bright white . 
a blue green 
thanks for posting your question , as of today january 7 , 2014 this item will take 3-5 business days for you to receive it . this item is sold by a seller . shipping rates , restrictions , and methods vary from seller to seller and are n't set by amazon.com . for more information on the sellers shipping terms and for details on how to contact them please click on their name and then the `` detailed seller information '' button . i hope this was helpful 
no , mine did not come with a cover 
yes , and four lovely throws . great quality for the price 
duvet cover , three pillows , two shams , and a bed skirt 
i am not sure but it is very thin fabric great for the price but not very heavy fabric or study . think of like a thin sheet that is what the duvet cover is like . it still looks really great if you have a fluffy cushy blanket to go inside : - ) 
have only washed it once . washed on delicate dried on medium and took out promptly from dryer . it looks great . i think it will hold up nicely 
no 
a cotten poly blend and absolutly beautifull ! ! i love love love mine ! ! 
a little larger then standard king ... i purchased a king down comforter to stuff my duvet cover with and the cover is larger then the comforter ... .i believe the exact dimentions are on the web site for the cover and pillows ... .it would easly fit a larger then king bed ... 
the material is much thinner and starchier . in the end , i returned mine and decided to spend more money on one from pottery barn . but for the price , it is a decent product . 
it also comes with 3 throw pillows : ) 
it 's really large on my full size bed , and fits a queen insert perfectly . honestly the best bang for your buck . it also does n't hold stains at all . i have two toddler nephews ... not even they have been able to mess it up . i 've had it for about 6 months . 
it is machine washable . i have a cat ( a lot of cat hair gets on it ! ) and it 's easy to throw in the washing machine . this duvet gets laundered at least once a week . holds up nicely . but i have n't used bleach . still white . 
yes ! ! 
no . it 's just a duvet cover , two shams , bed skirt and three decorative pillows . 
yes ! it feels similar to flat fitted bed sheets . 
i have 2 dogs . they have hair not fur but it still gets all over the house . i let them lay on my bed sometimes and the hair does n't seem to cling to it at all . 
no , it does n't . 
74 inches x 60 inches x 3 inches 
i have n't tried the gel , but i like to be warm at night so that does n't bother me . this topper is extremely comfortable , that 's the main thing . 
we never tried latex , so have no response . we like the memory foam a lot ! 
hi , lani . i got two of these , and they are really nice . it is square 11 1 4 '' x 11 1 4 '' , but the molding around the base of the organizer takes it to 11 3 4 '' ( in case you 're trying to squeeze it into a corner or something ) . it is 4 1 2 '' high in the front and 6 '' high in the back . the drawer is about 5 '' deep , and there is a hole for the wires in the bottom of the organizer as well as a compartment in the back ( with a hole for the wires ) that opens up . hope this helps ! 
the entire back is open . without having it near to measure , plan on the width of the cabinet , less ~ 1-inch for the combined side boards . also , the slide-out drawer is not full depth , so you have 3+inches behind it . i have a lot of wires extension cords stuffed behind it , and still able to slide tight agains the wall , hiding all of them ( except for the outlet on the wall ) . i hope that helps . 
you would probably want to use shelf brackets as this is rather heavy . another possibility would be to mount a wall shelf and put the organizer on the shelf . you 'll want access to the back of the unit in order to insert or remove the chargers for your devices . 
yes ! a power strip with 4 outlets fit in the back and it nicely hides the cords and just the power strip is plugged into the wall . 
the back has a hinged door on it that would possible to remove , but you may find your current charger fits inside without having to remove it . i have a surge protector power strip inside with all the attendant charger cords and they all fit . 
an ipod can sit anywhere you want it to , on the top or bottom shelf . 
it 's 10 1 4 inches wide by 5 inches deep and then there is a lip that stands one quarter inch high . if you rest on top of the lip it measures 11 1 4 by 5 1 2. hope this helps 
power strip not included 
i charge a nook tablet . a hd nook tablet . a droid phone . a nook e reader . i 'm capable of charging simultaneously , however they overlap . i do not care as they all are on charging station but there are not slots just tiers . the end result is my electronic life is charged and ready as a result . 
not at this time , only white . the organizing place 
i buy mosa soda cartridges on that big internet auction website that amazon probably wo n't let me mention here . starts with an e -- - ! i buy them in lots of more than 100 cartridges -- gets the cost down to somewhere about 30 cents each . 
it only carbonates one 16 oz bottle . they are small co2 cartridges and when they discharge they are useless . you can buy them super cheap at army surplus stores or outdoor activity stores . they are the same cartridges used in paintball guns and bb guns . 
the bottle and applicator do not really have expiration dates . they are equipment . the cartridges and and flavor packs probably have expiration dates ; however , i used them up over a year ago . cartridges cost a fraction if you get a generic brand from amazon and they work just as well . sorry i could not answer your question better ; however , if you could specify what part of the system has an expired expiration date i might be able to assist you more . 
yes . the line is near the top of the bottle . one cartridge makes one bottle . 
it takes between 5 and 10 seconds . not that it fluctuates , but it 's my guess . note there is more though . once the gasification is complete you need to shake the bottle assembly to maximize the bubble effect . i usually shake it about 30 times . finally , wait about 30 seconds after the gasification has stopped before unscrewing the cartridge chamber rod assembly . in summary , the entire process requires about 40 seconds from gas release commencement before you can pour the final product . 
the bottle is plastic . 
we use it to carbonate other liquids . no problems for 6 months . 
no idea i went to bbb and picked up the ones they have for the other devices they work just as well . 
you can find the bottles at the cuisinart website , i believe . i have not tried it with another bottle , but i think if the top fits properly , there should be no problem . 
yes ! i bought isi soda chargers 
800 
no it is fixed , 
medium thickness , 1.25 inches . not deep waffles , but not eggo style either 
not sure of wattage , but this unit has multiple heat settings . we like our waffles crisp , so we set it at 4 ( it goes to 6 ) ant it 's just right . setting at 6 , the waffles are easily burned . hope this helps . 
8 1 2 inches 
china 
no this one looks expensive and it feels heavy and well made . i got a cheaper cuisinart for a gift , so i know what you mean by cheap , and this one is nothing like the other one . you wo n't be disappointed with this one ! makes perfect waffles ! 
i do not know . i returned it because mine did not cook evenly . 
it takes 1 cup of batter . i love my waffle maker . it does tend to run hot so you would probably like setting number 2. that is where i have determined that mine needs to be set . hope you enjoy yours as much as we do mine . 
the directions in the manual say 1 cup 
no . the pancakes are only on the bottom half . we used to have a ge waffle griddle years ago that did open flat but this one does n't . but , it 's the best waffle maker we 've had , we love it . it makes the best waffles and is so easy to use . 
no , can not be flipped , but we have found no reason to wish that it was ! works great , and we love it ! totally agree with comments from dj giles . and , great recipes come with it ! every saturday morning is great at our house ! : - ) 
it comes with 2 waffle plates and 2 pancake plates . all are removable and dishwasher safe . it 's a terrific product . 
8 '' square ... it makes 4 - 4 '' square waffles . we love this waffle maker ! 
not very , that 's mostly why i returned it . i wanted `` belgian '' and they were slightly larger then regular . 
about 4 minutes to heat and 4 min to cook 
no - it does not . plus it beeps when the griddle is ready and again when the waffles are done . 
it wraps around . 
it warms up in about 5 minutes and 3 or 4 minutes to cook a waffle . we also use it to make hash browns and such . 
the sticker on the bottoms says '' 1200 watts '' 
certainly . ... .this item takes 3 aa batteries ... .its cordless ... led bulbs ... never change the bulbs ... ... ill ship this tomorrow first thing if you like ... .hope i answered your question ... .. 
the crackle template that you peel and mount to the wall has markings for two screws . the hammer hangs from those two screws , love it . -- jack 's dad 
3d light fx 
it takes 3 aa alkaline batteries . 
depends how long you leave it on . if you leave it on all night , probably a couple of weeks . it gets dimmer as the batteries die . 
since i only turn it on at night , i guess couple of months 
yes , it was installed on a blue wall and looked great . 
the hammer is light weight and held on with screws and raw plugs . the screws are not extremely long however is quite sturdy . hope this helps : ) 
ours is on a blue wall and it looks great . the four year old asked why we smashed the wall . 
it is about 3'x4 ' . the chair is in two pieces and the legs are off . the fedex guy carried it up 5 stairs to my door without using a dolly . 
i 've forgotten the industry name for the stuff , but it is 'mostly ' leather , a composite of ground up leather and synthetics which feels , acts , and smells like leather , is sturdy and authentic looking . the chair is attractive , has a nice 'hand ' if you prefer to sit on on leather , and is a bargain . i suspect the frame will loosen up and fail long before the composite leather upholstery wears out . ah , found it in wikipedia , it 's 'bonded leather ' , `` ... the us federal trade commission recommends according to 16 c.f.r . section 24 : `` for example : an industry product made of a composition material consisting of 60 % shredded leather fibers may be described as : bonded leather containing 60 % leather fibers and 40 % non-leather substances . `` [ 7 ] the federal trade commission has said that `` the guidelines caution against misrepresentations about the leather content in products containing ground , reconstituted , or bonded leather , and state that such products , when they appear to be made of leather , should be accompanied by a disclosure as to the percentage of leather or other fiber content . the guidelines also state that these disclosures should be included in any product advertising that might otherwise mislead consumers as to the composition of the product ... '' 
made in china 
something is wrong . may have to send it back . it should lock . 
i would say 17-20 inches . i have the chair in a corner of the room and the top of the chair is 17 '' from the wall . this allows me to fully extend the recliner . 
it is not as tall as some recliners , but quite comfortable ( maybe not nap comfortable ) 
i use for my ipad air and my old ipad also . 
no

yes 
no , i m sorry 
my tablet is 6 '' x 8 '' . the groove in the tablet stand is 1 2 '' which is what my table measures . hope this will help you . katie 
it just sits in a little groove but it 's lined with non-slip material . 
not really its purpose , but `` thinking outside the box '' , why not ! it has a stylus pen so you do n't have to touch the screen , just use the pen . the tablet stand adjusts to various angles from 90* to 20* or so . you 'd have to use it on a counter or table flat surface versus your lap . never thought of a use like that , but why not . depends on your puzzle gaming style , i guess . 
it is narrow and i am not sure that it would be stable enough for a surface table without the chance of it falling over . 
probably not . the stand is really meant to hold an ipad mini without any case . i wanted to use it for ease in taking credit cards so it is perfect for that but not with a case . 
i had the ipad 2 and it worked with that one as well as the 3 and i now have the ipad air that works fine . 
yes , that 's one of the great features of the iprep-no need to take the case off ! 
the stand is a good quality plastic ... we really like it . 
there is prox 1 2 '' of space for your tablet . if yours along with the case is less than that , then it should work . we take ours out of the case when we use it at home . 
yes it will hold a 10 '' tablet . karen eurostoves 
i just tested it and it works quite well with the apple cover that i have . karen eurostoves 
yes . i have the ipad air smart cover front and back and it works great ! 
i love these bowls . they are my every day go to bowls . the smallest is perfect for scrambling a couple of eggs and the largest is big enough for double cake batches or a large family size salad . and they are truly dishwasher safe . great buy . 
yes 
i have run mine through the dishwasher many times without any problems . 
these are soft plastic and are not made of melamine . 
yes i 've used them in the microwave . i love them , they all fit into each other and save space and i 'm loving the colors 
it has neither a zipper or buttons . the closure is by tying and it comes out pretty functional , and looks good when tied 
i do not know thread count , but it is very durable , nice looking and this color blends very well with any natural colors . 
yes , we have matching sham and pillow cases . unfortunately we are currently out of stock and we expect our next shipment in about a month . 
queen fits , but the duvet cover is maybe 3 inches longer than it is wide so there is left-over space at the bottom . 
just the cover 
it 's a neutral beigy-peachy-pinkish shade , it goes with all my other sheet sets . i would not call it gold . you can wash it but it comes out wrinkled . after a while on the bed the crumpled look relaxes but it does not become smooth like it is when it arrives . 
this duvet covet is tie closure instead of zip closure . most of our customers find it to be pretty easy to use . 
no it did not come with pillow shams . i have not washed it yet so do n't know if it is wrinkle resistant although i do n't remember it having any creases from the packaging or if it did have creases they disappeared quickly .

product dimensions:12.4 inches x 11.6 inches x 8.5 inches ; 5.4 pounds 
probably china at that price . 
it seems solid and basic to me . it toasts bread and bagels . my wife and i like it . 
no , a blue light does go on however and goes off when the toast is done . you do hear easily hear the toast pop up also . 
basic `` type a '' american plug..you know 2 flat prongs , with one prong slightly wider than the other . 
the slots the slots are 5 1 2 long and 1 1 2 wide . well fitted for bagels , etc . we 're very happy with it . 
mine is not doing that . i live in a very humid climate and i do n't wipe my down very often and when i do i use a organic cleanser and disinfectant . moisture i thought was the main cause for rust.sorry . 
the cord is attached to the back but it is not retractable 
mine looks just like this one . no icons . 
hi , you can fry fish and chicken but not a deep fry . i use a small amount of oil with the oster on a medium heat and brown each side then reduce the heat , cover and cook until done . my one word of caution is the middle does get quite hot because of the element so watch the food close to the center . good luck and happy cooking ! this is a fun little cooker and you will be so surprised how may meals it will provide ! so fry away ! remember ... . easy with the oil and you will be fine . have a great day ! 
it 's 2.5 '' deep . if you 're talking deep frying , no . get yourself a deep fryer for that . but for frying chicken in an inch or so of oil , etc , yes . people cook fried chicken in frying pans all the time , and this one is no exception . i have fried and stir fried , and pan fried in mine . it does great pork chops and steaks . i do a cross between pan-fried and oven baked chicken in it . they all turn out very successfully , moist and tender , but properly cooked , and it can do a very nice crispy exterior , if you want it . i do my 'world famous ' fried squash parmesan , and it 's the best i have ever tasted . in other words , it 's very versatile , and can turn out pretty much whatever you want . i love mine . ( it 's easy to clean , too ) enjoy 
no , the pan is not removable . after each use , you can clean the duraceramic skillet by wiping down the cooking surface with a damp cloth and drying it thoroughly . the skillet is not dishwasher safe , you may wash it with hot soapy water . do not immerse the temperature control probe or the skillet in liquids . 
1200 watrs 
yes , it is very durable . i have found it to be more so than any teflon coated pan i have owned . the only problem that i have found is that the area where the heat ring is gets extremely hot , and cooks things quicker when the stuff is on that area of the pan . my suggestion , just keep stirring , turning , or rotating the stuff . 
i believe it 's 190 ( i 'm at work so not sure ) . it has a simmer setting and that works great ! i browned some frozen perogies last night , but felt the middle of the potato could of been hotter . i set the skillet to simmer and left it for about 15 minutes . the inside was real hot after that , but the outside never burned 
i do n't know without a scales , but it is as light as the old style non-stick electric fry pan i had . i doubt it is more than 2 pounds . i consider it light-weight . sorry i ca n't be specific , but i 've never beeen able to cook as quickly and to my taste as with this product . clean up is a breeze . 
this electric skillet is designed with unique , innovative duraceramic non-stick ceramic coating . it is not necessary to add oil or cooking spray to the surface before cooking . 
110watt , cooks great . 
it holds 3 quarts . but 2 comfortably , i would say , depending on what you 're cooking . 3 quarts of liquid puts it within a half inch of the top of the pan . 
yes it is very smooth but i must add that it is very lightweight and when re-heating some left over casserole it burned and was hard to clean ... ..i am going to donate this pan to a free dinner kitchen ... ... : ( 
this looks like the pot i purchased . yes it works on an induction stove . that is the type of stove i have . 
china 
about 3 1 2 '' 
7.5 '' 
i use it on an induction cooktop . might not be the best stand alone pans . but for usage as a double boiler it 's fine . 
the maximum weight is 20 graims . place the two supplied 10 graim weights and calibrate . if you need more accuracy buy an expensive scale . this is a great accurate scale for the price . 
you probably shouldnt be a part of the research if you are participating in the trials , but yes it can . be aware the surface od the scale itself is only about the size of a half dollar . 
should work ! 
yes , just put it on the scale and hit the tare button and the scale will zero with the `` weigh-boat '' on it . then you will know the exact weight of what you put in it . very pleased with my scale ! 
yes it will , not very accurately though . but it goes from 0.001g to 20.000g . if you really need to be precise to the mg , i recommend spending more money . 
that is a distinct possibility . the auto-off feature is a bit irritating to work around . i 'd recommend writing down the weight of the object you are taring to just in case . 
no it can not . this is a simple digital read out scale . 
yes . it will measure to the hundredths in grains . i just tried it . 
aaa 
the black weighing pad should not be removed . i have n't tried because it would probably ruin the sensor . 
yes and very well 
it 's an incredibly accurate scale so you wo n't have to worry about inconsistent loading , but the scale 's weighing dish will only hold about 3 grams of powder . i 'm not familiar with how much powder you need to reload the casings shells you 're loading but if you need more than a few grams you may want to get a scale with a larger weighing surface . you probably only need accuracy to 0.01grams for your purposes rather than 0.001g like this scale , but if consistency is your biggest concern then this scale is perfect for you . 
you sure can , though i would n't recommend weighing anything heavier than 4 quarters ( ~22g ) as the limit of the scale is 20g ( 0.70z ) . it 's quite accurate as a compensation , however , you just have to calibrate it and check it with the included masses . hope that helps ! 
technically , this scale weighs in grams for its metric unit . so 1g=1,000mg . so when your scale reads `` 0.055g , '' that 's 55mg . it will not read in `` mg '' directly , though it is accurate enough that you can read for mass in grams to the thousandth-place ( 0.001 ) , which by default is the milligram . it 's just a matter of reading it moving the decimal so that it converts . hope that helps ! 
0.3 
china . 
the tray is removable it just sits on there 
another answer reports that the tolerance is 3 mg , so if it measures 6 mg , the actual mass is between 3 mg and 9 mg ( and most likely closest to 6 mg , following a bell curve ) . hope that helps ! 
nope , it only takes batteries .

i live in australia and mine was firmly packed and i had no issue so i think you will be safe 
logo and tardis from matt smith , it has the st john ambulance logo on door and that appeared around 2010 . 
it 's just one 
yes . i 've made hot chocolate in it before using the microwave . it is not dishwasher safe . my boyfriend 's mom forgot , and now it 's ruined . the color changing label melted and distorted . 
i found that it had a rather strong chemical smell for a few days . it would be best to air it out . 
it is the most comfortable thing i have ever had , is sooth and cool so love it . i would recommend it to anyone . my old mattress was not quite ready to be thrown so this adds to the comfort and is terrific . i had one in the past years but had to give it away when i moved . this is every bit as nice and do love it . i got the 4 inch and it is just right . 
3.2 i belive . i am in love with mine ! 
no 
i don '' t know , but it is very good.the size was a little bigar . 
we have had ours for a couple of months now and are very happy with it . i do n't know what you mean by tearing . as for squashed over time , we will just have to wait and see . 
the bump side is what u lay on i think but it does loose its comfort after a month . 
hello and in response to your question it is a queen size mattress 
hello mrs. ms. vicki b. , hey , great choice in the mattress topper you are considering . it consistently rates over 4.5 stars pretty much everywhere it 's listed , and is a frequent and fast seller ! you 're probably aware , but i 'll mention it just in case you are not , the item you 're inquiring about is not an actual mattress , but a `` mattress topper . '' mattress toppers are often added to an existing mattress for extra cushioning and comfort , and or as a simple and inexpensive `` upgrade '' an existing mattress - `` inexpensive '' relative to the greater cost of purchasing an actual mattress . ========================================================================================== the answer your questions are , from the manufacturer , `` density : '3.5 pound , ' and `` product features : 'antimicrobial , hypoallergenic , made in usa ' '' - respectively . ========================================================================================== you will note that besides ourselves , `` qualityassuredproductsunlimited , '' there are a handful of other sellers offering this item , and that we are not the cheapest . we are all here to serve you , however - that your shopping experience at amazon more than meets your expectations , and has you coming back again and again . 
thank you for your question . this item does not have a zip off . the size is for a twin , full and queen . we will be posting the king now as well for a higher price . 
there is not a button for this function . if you place a bowl or item on the scale after its been turned on all you have to do is push the on button again and it will reset to 0 and not count the weight of bowl or item and then you can add food you to want to weigh . 
yes if you put something on it , hit the tare button , weigh something else , and then remove it all . like if you put a plate on it , zeroed it out and then weighed some food . when you remove the food and plate , it would show a negative . 
it is plastic and i put mine through the dishwasher with no problems 
the plastic bowl is dishwasher safe 
0.1 oz or 2gram depending on mode . the scale also adds adjusts for the 4.4 oz . bowl , if you choose to use it . 
this scale will weigh up to 11 pounds 
5 inches 
yes it will 
i was not able to find it either . that 's what is so frustrating ! if you find it online please post the info here . 
no , only kg and grams . ( or pounds and ounces , depending on which mode you choose ) 
the bottoms of the bowls are flat .

metal 
i use this in my home with regular carpet and at trade shows with low pile carpet . i display ceramic warmers so it has to be sturdy . i 've never had an issue at any location . based on my experience , you should not have to attach it to the wall . 
yes . you can by it with wheels . 
11 1 2 from wall , 24 inches wide , 65 inches high . each shelf is 9 1 2 inches deep 
black is all i saw , and it was the one i was looking for .

i have no idea ... it 's a totally rechargeable battery so i do n't think you ever need to remove it . 
i would imagine being that old it would be difficult to find a replacement battery . a battery will go bad just like a battery in a car it will eventually go bad and need to be replaced . i have n't had this problem the handle on mine broke and could not find a replacement so i had to puachase a new one . 
send it back , should sound stronger and pick up dog hair with no problem . 
yes it does ! ! 
they should replace it free of charge if you only had it a month . of course if you have had it a long time the probably will not . it is worth calling customer service and talking to them . they are nice . 
yes . two settings . one for floor and another for carpet 
the handles should just lock or snap together . you have to make sure the ends of the middle section ( between the hand end and the machine end ) are oriented in the right direction . hope this helps ... otherwise , you should be able to find a customer service number for them in the manual or on their website . best of lock . 
you can purchase a new rechargable battery through amazon . as for replacement parts they can be purchased from shark at very high prices . groupon recently offered a reconditioned unit . it is best to purchase a new unit . 
yes 
the shark multi-floor steam energized cleanser is discontinued in all stores . it is currently sold out not available online or in any store . any customer who owns a shark steam mop , etc is aware that the steam energized cleanser is crucial to have in conjunction with the steam mop or it will not properly clean and the steam mop will not work with other cleaners . the small amount of multi-floor cleanser that is still being sold is the remainder of the discontinued product . it is sold at a higher value due to many sellers having to purchase it in other countries such as canada , uk , etc . it is a higher value now due to the high demand of this product . it is the only product that can be used for shark steam mops . once , they are not being sold anymore , many of us will have to wait for another type of cleaner that shark may or may not come out with soon . 
i would say no , it does not even work on my shark but it was listed . i am done with shark products , they are cheap and flimsy 
the cleaning sprays in front of the mop . it will have a different sound and you wo n't see the spray come out . hope that helped . i love my machine ! 
approxt 5-6 rooms per cleaning 
the product is out of stock for a while now and very limited qty with few sellers . 
this product is out of stock for a while now , very limited quantity is available . 
its all about convenience and time 
bed bath & beyond is less expensive than most places i 've looked ( use their coupon . ) best buy also carries it . 
it appears virtually the same to me . it fits in the mop holder . 
i ordered from amazon prime , 6.29 each bottle , i did order thee bottles . 
definitely ! 
i would measure the area where the pad fits and compare that to the descriptions on the item you are looking at and compare sizes . 
i clean it after each daiy use - the area i use it on is kitchen , dining area , lg foyer , laundry area and bathrooms . i bought a second pad in case there might days that the tiles were extra badly soiled . 
it did n't fit on my vac-then-steam shark . was disappointed with the purchase as it did n't fit my machine . probably should contact the company and ask them before buying . hope this was somewhat helpful . good luck . 
this seems to be a recurring question , and i 've already answered it a couple of times . it is correctly sized tor the sharp steam and spray mops . i 'm too lazy to go measure it again , but no worry . it 's the same as original , and if you are in need of backup pad , you 'll be happy with it . after hearing from barbara again , i checked with shark via their online chat and was told the 3101 measures 15.5 x 7. i told them they need to make it clearer for customers and potential customers . my own shark is an sk141 , and the 13.5 wide pad fits just fine . it did n't seem to shrink when i washed the original one , but i now see judy has one that 's only 10 inches wide . oh , for the `` olden days '' when there were far fewer choices and no confusion . heavy sigh . 
i had to go to the shark website and contact them . it was really easy . i used the chat option . i asked them what reusable pad would work with my mop and the gave me the model number of the pad . i came here to amazon and entered the number in amazon search and it came right up . i had a ton of trouble finding the right pad before i did this . i was also shopping at wal-mart , so that can attribute to alot of head ache as well . 
i would measure the one you got with your mop , i ordered some and they were a little small and kept rolling off the base . 
12 1 2 x 5 3 4 
i have a shark steam mop , so i got these by mistake . i decided to keep them because they f.it good enough for me . 
yes . 
actually , the motor in this unit is more powerful than the vitamix . i think only company that has more powerful motor is blendtec . but you 'll be shelling out at least $ 300 more . and this unit goes up to 24000 rpm which is same as blendtec . same speed ... think ... 
from what i have read , it only has lead in the paint on the box it comes in and the plug . 
just contacted euro-pro ninja product manufacturer to ask about lead claims in their products . i mentioned what i had read so far on the web about the claims and brought up the severity of making false claims about a product for more sales and more money . they responded the following : `` andrea : hi , my name is andrea . how may i help you ? andrea : hello , how may i help you ? andrea : may i help you today ? andrea : is there anything i can do for you today ? ian : hi andrea , i have been shopping around for a blender and noticed the ninja dual stage blender with cups bl-810 ( bl-830 ) ... . looks very interesting . i have on the other hand noticed a growing concern on the web by consumers about the machine containing lead . i would like to have a written confirmation that there is no lead , and if it does contain lead , where lead can be found in the machine ? is the lead in contact with food ? vitamix and other people claim that there is lead on the blade ... . there is a serious legal issue related to false claims ... andrea : the warning was put on all blender instruction books because of us california proposition 65 which limits the amount of lead in a product to 200 ppm . the power cord used on the product is made from pvc which does use a small amount of lead as a stabilizer . since the addition of this warning in our manual , we have had all power cords tested for compliance with this proposition . we have certified results that this power cord and all other power cords used in our products do meet the requirements of proposition 65 of less than 200 ppm of lead . this is not a hazard to users and the warning can now be removed . ian : so no lead in the container or container blade socket that is in contact with the food ? andrea : no , the lead is only in the cord . '' manufacturers and resellers of competing products should stop making all kinds of claims . in any case , i do n't get what the concern is about as far as making sales go . blendtec , vitamix and ninja products can generate similar results , but you ca n't expect a 250 $ machine to entirely compare to a 600-750 $ machine . what 's the fuss about ! they are totally different markets and customer segments . not everyone has 650 $ to land their blender . yes , a small segment of the market might sway from product to product , but in the end if you are a reasonable and intelligent consumer . you know or can guess that a container blade socket made from pvc can not guaranty the same life span as metal . 
without the food processor attachment from ninjas website , it just liquefies them 
i had the same problem with my bella mixer , but i have had no leaking issues with my ninja 's single serve cups . i 've had it a couple months now , use it almost every morning , & no leaks ! 
hi , thank you for your message . this blender does not grind nuts and coffee . thank you ! buyhappier 
those items can be purchased from ninjas website directly . you can google the ninja ultima and proceed to the website to purchase . 
i 've never had nor worked with a vitamix but i 've never had a blender that was this easy to clean ! i put a drop of dish washing liquid in it and fill the pitcher half full of water and pop the lid on and buzz it for 10-30 seconds , whatever i 'm in the mood for , and rinse clean . once in a while i run it through the dishwasher , like when i make mayonnaise , just to ensure the greasiness gets washed away really well . 
not without a voltage converter . 
the blender will not grind nuts into powder as there is a lot of oil contained in nuts ; this blender will grind nuts into nut butter ; ie. , peanuts into peanut butter . the blender will also grind coffee beans . if coffee beans are ground too fine , the coffee brewed from such fine ground beans will taste unpleasantly bitter . 
cool mist . must sit level . 
hi , dear tara , this cord has 32 inches long . 
yes . it has an on off button behind the humidifier above the usb-cable connection . 
9.5*7.5*7.5cm 
i 'm usually able to make 4 and sometimes 5. i fill it about 2 3 of the way . i bought these 6 months ago and really like it . 
sorry i have been having email trouble and just saw your question . if you still need to know the measurements they are 6.9 x 2.1 x 3.6 inches . they are a little on the spendy side but what is n't now day 's . they are a very nice pan and wash up really easy . 
they do not have a non stick coating , but very easy to prep . cook evenly ... almost perfectly every time with an added benefit of a healthier option compared to a non stick product . 
yes 
sorry i have not tried high acid or gluten free bread mix in these pans . i have made lots of quick breads from scratch but none with a high acid content . 
yes . but these pans are very very small ! i have no use for mine , thought they were bigger : ( 
the pans i received are like the stacked photo with a wider lip on the ends like a grip area , making them easy to pick up ... no rolled edge , but very nice , the actual inside dimensions are 5.5 '' x3 '' x2 '' deep .. the dims in the description include the flange around the top 
this is item is a polyester and polyester-blend material . 
we are sorry . we do not have one in stock at this time and we are not sure when one will be available . thank you for asking . 
i know it 's not a true red but that is what the manufacturer is calling it . i do n't know . a light burgundy ? but , it does looks like the image shown on the product detail page . 
the cup i received would leak and is actually very hard to even get the lid to seal at all . even when it is sealed the top has a slider to open and close and yes it leaks ! i only use mine when i 'm at home and no lid is even needed . 
the weight is 8.6 oz each . 
yes 
i gave it as a gift at christmas time , but i believed it was made in china . the inside was stainless steel and the outside was molded plastic . it 's a very nice mug . 
i would say yes , we always wash them in the dishwasher . 
screw on 
4.75 '' on the outside . from bottom to top inside is 4.25 '' and you can fill it up to about 4 '' with room for the lid . 
10 oz . 
hi dear cutomer it with stainless steel and plastic best regards 
as far as i can see , the listing still offers free shipping on this mug . 
disassembled . easy to put together 
table is 17 '' h and stools are 15 '' h 
40 '' very thick i believe they do provide replacement glass.just call them 
no ... sorry . 
i will ask my husband tomorrow but i think it is solid wood . we saw it at raymore and flannigan first . and then ordered it online due to it being less money on line . 
it is 171 2inches high . there is n't a 36 inch dimension . it 's actually 39 inches in diameter . 
hi , thanks for submitting your question . according to the manufacturer website , the height of this table is 36 inches . i hope this helps !

made in italy by saeco . the saeco plant has been purchased by philips electronics from the netherlands . 
yes you can and very good drip coffee 
it will not get to 190 ever . it 'll may espresso at 175 , cappuccinos are more like 165 160 because the milk cools down the coffee . we love our machine though . 
everything is very accessible . you open the front door ( drip tray opens with it , which is nice ) , pull the drawer and empty it . easy . there is a weekly and monthly maintenance regimen that should be followed to keep all running smoothly . the cost of making higher end coffee , i think . we have had ours for two weeks now and really like the machine and the coffee it produces . 
unfortunately no . i have to put the unit on the end of my cabinet and fill from the side with a pitcher . 
the connector on the machine for the milk frothing pitcher is made of some type of plastic material , as well as the pitcher . i believe steam enters and exits the pitcher to work the frothing mechanism - there are two little hard plastic tubes for this purpose . the brew group is also made of plastic and metal . if you are concerned about possible impact on taste , i do n't detect any plastic in my coffee . nor are there any smells that would indicate warming or melting of plastic . probably best to contact philips if you are concerned about specific plastic compounds that are used inside the machine . 
the machines sold in the usa come with the right cord and work on 60hz 110v . if you are thinking to travel to another country , especially in europe you may have to puchase a transformer to bring the voltage down from 220 to 110. the frequency difference will not affect the machine except for the clock that will not keep the right time 
very quiet compared to other machines such as the de longhi 
as stated in the product details : 45.2 x 11.8 x 19.7 inches . i took a tape measure to mine and confirmed . 
black 
i do not know ... .i did not even get the delivery of this item..sorry ! ! 
small enough that it 's and end table for a midget 
thank you for posting your question . the dimensions of this item are 45.2 x 11.8 x 19.7 inches . this information can be found on the product detail page under the `` product description '' section . hope this helps

you take out the stopper & lay this over the bath tub drain opening . i have one for all my tubs & they all fit snugly over the drain . there is a model that fits over the stopper . that model has suction cups to secure it . i 've purchased that model & prefer this one . it 's easy to clean & is rust free . 
yes it should as long as the drain size is correct 
the dimensions are listed as 2.8 inches . that means it is just over 2-3 4 '' . so the answer would be no . 
it 's very slightly convex ( curved up in the center ) . 
[ edited original response -- oops ! ] this is a simple cover that does n't have screws or any kind of suction quality to it so it will move around if it is covering a central drain or any drain that your feet come in contact with . in our tub shower the drain sits directly underneath the tub faucet , so my feet never go there when showering ( or else my shins would be hitting the tub faucet -- ouch ) . it works great for us because it 's in this 'semi-protected ' spot . but if you have a central drain you walk on , you might want to look for something else . 
they are not large at all but i could n't tell you exactly the size . i can tell you that it catches a lot of hair and the rubber rim does a good job sealing around the drain . 
2 13 16 '' 
no , it sits almost flush with the surface it is on , so you 'd have to remove the pop-up lid . 
the exact height is 11-7 8 '' . ours is hung under the upper cab . if sitting on a counter , the height is 11-7 8 '' x 24 '' w . 
you guys are crazy nobody has answered it should be on the website ! ! ! how awful , , , , 
did you ever find the answer to your question ? i have the same issue . thanks . 
yes . 
you have to allow for the bend radius of the power cord on the back of the `` box '' in addition to the depth dimension of the mw `` box '' itself . taking a measurement off the back wall in my installation to the front of the `` box ' is 13 3 4 inches ( includes the bend radius ) . the feet are then 10 3 4 inches from the back wall . my mw `` box '' extends about 1 inch beyond the face of the cabinet . under cabinet installation ; not in the cabinet . 
yes , pem31dfww . 
no 
yes . very quiet unit and heats things well . good purchase . 
10 1 2 inches -- plenty big enough for most things 
the monogram line is going to have more built-in options and panel ready options . they are also typically made from a higher quality material and just have a better over all look . monogram is considered to ge 's `` professional line '' where profile units tend to be higher end standard ge appliances . i personally believe both are pretty good quality on the whole . but like much of the appliance industry you need to take into account your personal needs and what exact unit will be the perfect fit for you . 
yes 
i just measured ours to confirm . it is 13.75 inches including the feet . the unit we received was a little lopsided so we had to shim the one side . i think you 'll be cutting it too close if your opening is only 13 '' . 
yes , the face is 24x13 without the accompanying ge `` built in '' trim kit . 
it is just a tiny bit more than 24 '' . 
you are replacing a different microwave with a different trim kit than what i did , so i ca n't be absolutely sure , but the dimensions of the opening of my old trim kit that worked for the peb7226sfss is 25 inches wide by 13 1 4 inches high . 
hi . i also had the old model oven and was able to reuse my existing trim kit on the new oven without problems . 
yes , it does . 
if it does i have n't found a way to turn it off ... ..sorry i could n't be of more help 
mine does n't have anything like that . 
i assume it has something to do with the sensor , since i did n't have it in my other oven 
the ge dimensions are closer to the actual dimensions . i just measured mine , and i come up with 24 '' wide x 11 7 8 '' high . depth is a little more difficult for me to measure because the microwave is already in place in the wall , and i ca n't get in to properly measure . however , i can tell that with the microwave pushed as far against the wall as possible , it sticks out 13 3 8 '' . some of that is probably due to the cord sticking out of the back . i have it installed in a 12 '' deep cabinet , so the door ( only ) sticks out beyond the cabinet , but it looks and functions fine . in fact , i think if the whole microwave , including the door , were fully recessed into the wall , you might have a difficult time opening the door ... if it was a tight fit . so for our purposes , it works perfectly . 
i 'm not sure . but over-the-range microwaves usually incorporate a hood to deal with hot air , moisture and grease , do n't they ? this does not . so i suppose it would work if mounted above a range , but i would n't mount it without a hood beneath . otherwise , it mounts quite easily from under a cabinet . 
best to ask the manufacturer , ge . the new model did not fit into the space where our original microwave by ge went ( because ge made the unit a bit taller ) , so we had to have a carpenter trim down the top and bottom of the cabinet so the taller unit would fit . it turned out fine , but it took a bit of effort . 
this does have an optional hanging kit that can be bought separately ; 
this unit is 24 '' wide so it would be a very tight fit . 
smoky 
bisque glass 
the glass is clear , but there is a metal mesh guard behind the glass , inside the microwave , that is the same color as the exterior . 
800 watts 
this is the only counter microwave that is in this color and the only size . thank you 
actual size is 11 3 4 '' high by 24 '' wide and 12 '' deep . take into consideration the power cord that extends out from the back top right . after cutting out a bit of wallboard to accommodate the cord bending , i was able to place microwave on a standard 11 3 4 '' shelf with one inch extending out beyond the shelf . 
dear lynn , you can mount this microwave under a cabinet with the purchase of the mounting kit model # jxa019k . 
dear ken , at 1.1 cubic feat , this unit is one of ge 's smaller models designed for tight spaces . the interior dimensions are 17-3 8 wide x 9 high x 12-1 4 deep . if you have any other questions , please feel free to call us at 888-768-1710 . 
yes . it will over hang a little . i put it in a pre-built cabinet 11 '' deep and it works . 
not sure what you mean by a vent fan but it does not vent like a range hood . it does however apparently draw air in through the rear and exhaust it out the front . there 's a grille area in the front below the door opening about 1 '' high and extends from left to right across the front of the unit . air is pushed out there . i read somewhere in previous ge units the air was vented in the rear and may have overheated the unit or at least shortened the life of the mechanical components especially if it was housed in an enclosed space . this unit is about 1 `` or so higher than the units it replaced . 
yes ! pem31dfbb 
david , ge lists the dimensions of this model as : overall depth 12 7 8 in overall height 12 1 8 in overall width 24 in 
dear steve , this model is designed as a countertop unit . however , ge does advise that you can purchase the 04-a019 hanging kit if you wish to hang this unit from the underside of a cabinet . 
about 12 7 8 '' including permanently affixed feet ( part of cabinet ) . i believe this question has asked and answered in the past . 
you 're probably cooking it too long . watch and listen as the corn pops . when the rate of popping slows down [ see directions on bag ] , stop the microwave and note the time used to get to that point . check your popcorn to see how much is still unpopped and whether it is burnt . with a little experimentation you can get a nice result . i 've never been able to pop all the kernels without burning , but you can remove the popped corn and then tape up the bag and return the unpopped kernels for more heating . 
no , unfortunately the feet are not removable and the height with the feet is about 11 3 4 '' . we had the same problem and had to modify the cabinet opening . 
about 4 ' feet 
three feet . fyi -- it 's the best microwave i 've ever had -- pretty quiet . 
the mounting bracket is attached to the back and on page 8 of the installation instructions , placement of the mounting plate , item # 4 -- it states that the 'mounting plate is attached to the back of the oven ' . i know that this question was asked over a year ago , but when i was preparing to buy this oven , i too was asking the same question and it was n't until we opened the box to prepare for installation of the oven , that i came across the answer to this question . so , i hope that this will be helpful to anyone looking for this answer while contemplating whether to buy it or not . 
not at all ! 
length 30 '' height 15.5 '' depth 15.5 '' 
yes , first button on the top row . 
same as any other microwave i have had 
yes . it does either 
not really . just remember to reduce cooking time by about 20 % for regular oven times . great to have the option to use as mw or convection oven - or both ! 
yes . we do from time to time . 
if used as a convection oven , alone or in combo with the microwave function , it will do things just as any hot air oven will . so , though i have n't tried it yet , i am sure that it will brown chicken when using the convection oven . i find it takes a long time to pre-heat - so unless i need a second oven , i do n't use it on convection . 
we have been using ours daily for a little over a year . no discolouration seen inside . 
when it worked for a week or so yes but need to add some water . nutibullet works great too also needs some water added . i liked the idea of more power with the bella but it did not last kim202wob mdt5n25a 
i actually just used it for some soup it did the job so i would say yes ! 
i did n't have a nutribullet , but my sister does . my bella makes quick work of pulverizing flax seeds and everything else , even with the blender blade ( not the one for coffee , nuts , etc . ) , and my sister 's nutribullet leaves them mostly whole . considering the huge price difference and more powerful motor along with the great reviews , i 'd try the bella . 
yes 
yes , i have 220 volts in jamaica and it works great 
push down , and turn clockwise until it clicks in . 
hi it will cost more to buy these separate- ( 129.00 compared to my 49.00 ) this i love because my friends , co workers and family have the bullet and mines work just as good 75 % less and way more extras parts . as not to boast or brag i never tell them what i paid . since they already spent 80.00 bucks more 
i do n't believe so . this is designed for 120v . if you have an adapter for the change of power , thst should be good . 
no 
yes . it even emulsifies little things like flax seeds . it does that with the regular blenders very well . i did n't even try it with the flat blades they intend to be used for that yet . 
one co2 cartridge makes one liter fizzy water . cheers ! 
yes , they are , i am using generic ones , much cheaper 
go on utube . orange juice is too thick , must be watered down . wine did work . i would do only half of bottle because it makes a lot of fizz . you would be using a whole co2 cartridge for a small amount . the manufactures do not reconmmend it . 
i do n't know , but i suggest that you read the directions carefully and try again . perhaps you have a defective product . there is an online video with step by step instructions you could view also . 
yes , but they are very expensive and much bigger . soda stream is a big commitment . it 's not cost efficient to throw them out and buy brand new ones . frankly , i have a bunch of different soda makers and the best by far is the old fashioned bottle that you charge and shake -- like from old time movies where they 'd add a spritz to some hard liquor . they are like $ 35 but last forever and the chargers are just pennies per liter . 
no ! the top of the bottle has notches to lock . you can make it in the bottle that comes with it , then pour it into the soda stream bottle . 
there is an airtight cap so the soda remains as in a siphon and retains the gas . however it is best to consume it with 24 hours . 
i use mine to make home made tonic water . it has citric acid and the zest of one lemon , one lime and one orange . and the bottle has held up quite well . i see no reason lemon juice would be different . just make sure to add after carbonation process . 
i always set mine at max setting . i use ice-cold water , charge it , shake it and let it set for a few minutes to relax . i then slowly remove the top and enjoy ! it seems you can not make it any more carbonated . very bubbly . i do n't want to ruin a parade but , check walmart dot com . $ 14.88 ! 
each one is good for one bottle . you can get 100 for about $ 35 , which is a good deal . 
no 
i am not sure what it is ... .sort of a very flimsy metal with lots of square holes ... i can tell you it is amazing ... makes the world of difference in foods cooked on this than ones just put on a cookie sheet in the oven . 
it is reusable and seems like it would last a long time . i have only used it a few times because after reading the label and thinking it through i have come to believe that it might leave unhealthy chemicals on the food . it is made of teflon-type stuff . it works well but i think i 'll invest in a metal rack designed for roasting food in ovens . if you do not have those kind of concerns -- -go for it . 
500 degrees 
i have not turned over the items i have cooked on it . i have mostly used this for frozen french fries or warming up those that i could not finish from a cafe . i have also warmed up fried chicken and it seemed to regain its crispyness . i warmed up pizza but did not notice that it got crispy . 
it only contains one mat . i love this thing for getting crunchy french fries out of my toaster oven . 
i believe only one ... 
yes you put it right on shelf . you could put those items on but you would need to put something under it while taking it out because it is not sturdy . 
i am sure it would , however i have only used in my convection oven , works awesome ! 
yes , they cut really easily with scissors . 
rpd-702wp can be continuously operated with 3 drainage options ; manual drain , gravity drain and condensate pump drain . the condensate pump can pump out ( and up ) condensation water through the included 16.5 ' drain for continuous water removal with approximately 15 ' of vertical lift . 
it takes heat to pull the moinsture from the air-so yes it puts heat out . but overall the room feels cooler because you are n't dealing with high humidity . when i first started my unit the humidity in the house was 91 percent . i have kept the humidity down to between 35-40 for several months , usually removing about 5 gallons of water a day ( empty cannister morning and night ) . i am from high mountain desert and humidity very low -- so the seattle humidity was killing me and my mold mildew allergies . no problems now with either and my home is comfortable . the little heat is worth all the other benefitis . i keep my unit downstairs and it keeps all 3500 sq ft nice and dry . had this for 8 months and would buy it again . 
no . not really . there is a plastic piece of unit that is about an eighth of an inch above the casters so you would gain a negligible amount of space even if caster did come off which i 'm not 100 % sure they do . i saw there was no gain so i did not investigate further . hope that helps . 
three choices : 3feet plastic 1 2 '' 16 feet plastic 5 16 '' for condensation pump option hose bib - user supplied hose 
nope 
it runs continuously . the compressor must cut in and out , but the fans always runs . i let mine run for a few days if it really gets damp , then it shut it off because the fan annoys me . the universe works very well though , and having the pump and discharge tube is great because you do n't have to empty a bucket all the time . 
you can not it on its back is a refrigerator you will burn up the motor . dig out the crawl space to accommodate . 
not sure how low it will go but when the area is dry no water is gathered 
it seems very sturdy . it slides right in and out . have n't had an issue with it yet 
yes ... that is what i am using it for currently basement . i went with this size because the smaller 30 pint was to much work for the unit . plus i did n't want to empty the bucket a million times a day 
it is very white ... a blue tint , typical led fashion . there is a difference in brightness from the low to high , but the color is not effected . if you are looking for a soft warm yellow , led is not the direction to go . the light is great for reading . 
no 
the instructions only say that charging time should not exceed 24 hrs . 
cable can be replaced by a generic cable . 
it seems to work as the instructions describe , 8 hours on low , 4 hours on high . http : www.dpled.com en proinfo.asp ? proid=2041 
technically `` yes '' but the cord is only about 18 inches long . so it would depend on the type of use , you 'd have to position the lamp . however the cord is removable , so after charging it you can place the lamp basically anywhere . that was the feature i liked best . 
its 90v - & gt ; 240v ... i think u can use in any country 
yes they do . 
yes , this little gem will till back as far as you can stand it it will illuminate the ceiling and go beyond the 1 80 if your surface can take it . it 's a wonderful product i would buy again and again.in my opinion it 's worth two or three times the asking price ! 
the base is 5x3x1 and when it is folded down it is very small at 5x3x2 so the base basically stays the same the entire time . hope this helps . 
overall width = 70 '' , overall height = 31 '' , depth = 30.5 '' , height to top of cushions = 20 '' , height to top of arms = 24 '' 
the deluxe is 5 inches longer - closer to a standard-size sofa ( but still on the short side of standard ) . this version is an apartment-sized version ( somewhere between a standard sofa and a standard loveseat ) . 
it 's easiest to put the filling inside before opening the bag since it expands once it opens . 
the sofa comes in very few pieces and hardly any hardware and is actually fun to assemble . 
it was approximately 4'x4'x3 ' . 
it 's an apartment-sized sofa , i.e . somewhere between a loveseat and sofa in width . 
this is the most amazing packaging i 'd ever seen . the un-assembled pieces are 34 '' x36 '' x14 '' . & lt ; that is not a misprint . the backrest screws into the seat without tools ! i am sure it would fit down stairs . i move the pieces separately up 3 flights of narrow stairs . very comfy . i would recommend it to a friend definitely . 
foam in the seats . batting in back cushions . 
it would be ok for them to sit on . it 's not super comfy to sleep on . 
this sofa is 72 '' in total with the arms . the sitting space though is obviously ~10 inches shorter than that though because the arms are excluded . 
yes both pillows 
total length unknown . i 'm 5 foot 9 and can not completely lay down . 
yes simple . to assemble no tools . needed 
checked the sofa when i got home . nope can not be flipped bottom portion of the sofa seat is different fabric . someone with sewing skill could probably create new seat covers for it ... neither the seat nor the back is attached to the sofa . 
yes . 
no 
2 adults fit comfortably on the couch . the cushions are soft . it has held ip fairly well . i had it for 7 months . i have 3 young children who constantly climb on it and occasionally jump on it . mine i 'd on s hardwood floor so it does slide because its lightweight . i washed the covers from the cushions in the washing machine and they came out great . 
bottom cushions are about 6.5 '' and back cushions are about 8 '' 
seat height is approx . 19 in . 
looks to be micro-suede . holds up well . we have 2 , dogs , 2 cats & 2 teenagers 
the seat is 20 '' height and 20 '' deep . 
removable yes . reversible no 
i did n't have a 64 box of crayons as a kid so describing the color is difficult for me : d the coloron my laptop monitor does match the real life sofa . it 's not really beige ... but a neutral color ... 
the seat cushions are very firm but the back pillows are not as firm as the seat cushions . i also have a bad back and the seat cushions are great and the back pillows are fine for me . 
plywood and hardwood frame . the hardwoods are `` lighter '' species - looks like poplar or similar . 
yes , but no heat ! if they shrink even a tiny bit , it would be impossible to get them back over the cushions . 
20 '' when the back cushions are in place 
no . it 's pretty low . then again i 'm 6'6 '' , so your mileage may vary . 
it is low profile you have to use the pillows to rest your head 
frame appears very sturdy . we have had it for several months and it is used daily without any problems . 
this does n't pull out to a bed . it 's only a sofa 
got mine a while ago..from what i remember it was about 3 ' x 3 ' x 3 ' . not huge..i was impressed by their packing mastery . 
it is stable . seating pillows do not keep you stable . - too much air and not flat . 
the seat cushions are firm but the back cushions are limp and never keep their shape . i wish someone would tell me how i can make them firmer . 
if i recall they were odorless . not sure if they were toxic . 
no . 
debth from back to front is 30 inches ; height from the floor up the back is 31 inches ; height from the floor to the top of the seat cushion is about 18 inches . 
300 lbs . per cushion , so 600 lbs . 
nope . not long enough for an adult to sleep on comfortably either . it 's just a love seat . 
no not for me . i am looking for comfort more than anything else . this serta does a great job , much better than other couches . 
i had been hoping for grey but it is more brown 
i do n't think it would fit too easily into a trunk . the trunk lid would have to be all the way open . the carton measures approx . 33 '' x 30 '' x 30 '' . look on the video and you can get an idea of the package size . if you have to transport it , it is probably easier to unpack it . 
this love seat is firm , so if you 're looking for a plush sofa you really sink into , it may not be for you . i think it 's comfortable and would buy it again . bonus : it was easy enough for me to put together by myself . 
3 
yes . there should be instructions for washing included in the installation instructions . 
when i had ordered my love seat , one of the bolts in the legs was stripped and would not attach properly . when i called the phone number listed on the instructions sheet , they agreed to send me a replacement part . perhaps they would do the same for your covers . 
from floor to top of seat cushion is 18 '' . i know you did n't ask this , but the sitting area ( between arms ) is 46 '' . 
i ment to warn my 400 lb . son not to sit on the love seat , i was worried it might not support his weight . before i had a chance to tell him he was settled on the love seat with the dog , he has sat on the love seat numerous times since with no problem . i think the `` real wood '' construction and center legs make it sturdy enough for just about anyone . 
no 
~3x3x4 . quite heavy . 
neither . it 's a couch . it does not pull out into a bed or anything of the sort . 
~ 34 ' . seating pillows are not very stable and sliding out . 
mine is exactly 60 inches . it can possibly squeeze into a 59 inch space as the sides are soft padded 
ok i will and ill respond 
the cushions are plenty think and i would say the firmness is a 3 . 
the throw pillows are approx . 16 inches by 16 inches . one side matches the pattern . the other side matches the color , but has a different design . they are approx . 6 inches deep in the center and taper down . since they are pillows . if you order this , i would wait until you receive it , to decide on pillow covers . 
measuring from the outside of the armrest it measures 75 '' ; the seat from the inside of armrest measures 62.5. one of the things that i do n't like about my couch is that the back cushions are a bit flimsy . you have to fluff it up regularly . i do however like the material . if you do decide to purchase it online remember that it will take 24-48 hours for the seat cushions to inflate to normal size . it 's easy to put together with two people . overall , i was satisfied with my purchase as it fits in a small apartment nicely . 
i 'm 5'5 '' and when i sit down , the edge of the cushion hits just behind my knee and the seat depth is perfect.. so not at all like the big crate and barrel sofas.. i have a very small cottage and it fits in the living room perfectly.. just enough for 2 average people to sit on . 
sofa 
def more tan . 
this is only a sofa . love seat size . there is no mattress . 
it 's a lighter color but really nice 
honestly its perfect for 2 adults , but 3 could fit snuggly depending in their size 
3 , not comfortable for sitting more than 1hr 
the sofa is 73 '' long . the problem o have is the width from back to front . in other words the cushions you sit on are not wide . when you lay on it you feel like you 're going to fall off . a queen size mattress is 60 '' wide if that 's any help . not sure what you mean 
yes , it does have an instruction manual with easy to follow recipes . i made a batch up yesterday following their basic instructions and it turned out really thick and tasty ! one thing i noticed in the recipe is that it called for 5 cups of milk along with the starter . since it has a one quart capacity i was confused by that so i used only 4 cups of milk , a half cup yogurt , and followed their tip for thicker yogurt by adding 1 2 cup of powdered milk and it came out perfect . for some more good recipes i went to www.eurocuisine.net and clicked on their manual for the ym80 yogurt maker and found a whole bunch of good info and recipes , you might check out those recipes too but buy the dash go , it 's the best and you do n't have to fool with all those little jars : o ) ! ! ! 
yes , you can make soy yogurt however , since soy is a very thin milk , you 'll have to add some thickening agents to get the yogurt to the right consistency . we recommend arrowroot or agar agar powder . 
there is no timer . simply unplug at the end of your desired duration . 
i do it all the time . use a thickener ( like corn or tapioca starch ) and a packet of unflavored gelatin when heating the almond soy blended milk to control thickness . i use more starter -- either double the powder or use powder and a storebought yogurt of same base . honey for sweetener to bump up the cultures . experiment !

hello , our yogurt make maintains a temperature of about 110-120 degrees . kefir will do better in a temperture range of 70-80 degrees . 
hi michael , yes , you do have to heat the milk ( not boil ) before placing it into the unit for cooking . we suggest heating it with a double boiler method until it reached 185 degrees , and then letting it cool to about 100-110 degrees . this will kill all the excess bacteria that might interfere with the cooking process but keeps all the good ones that we need to create more yogurt ! 
yes and no ... . greek yogurt is pretty much any yogurt that has been strained to remove excess whey making it thick like sour cream consistency . the yogurt culture used and length of time it is cultured determines how tart it becomes . i allow my yogurt to ferment for 12 hours or more and use a greek yogurt strainer basket to remove the whey , it then taste very much like sour cream ( i used it as a substitute for any where i would use sour cream ; making mash potatoes , on top of tacos or baked potatoes ... ) . or i ferment it for about 8 hours without straining the whey and it is less tart and taste more like sweet yogurt . the yogurt culture used also makes a difference in taste , and the longer it ferments the more tart or sour it taste . the yogurt bacteria produces acids and the more acids produced the more tart it is . the tartness can be controlled by picking a yogurt culture and fermentation time that suits your taste . 
yes 
sure . i let mine go overnight , then unplug in the morning . 
the total length of the spoon is about 7 1 2 inches ( 18.8 cm ) . the handle length is about 5 1 3 inches ( 13.5 cm ) . the diameter of the rounded part is about 2 inches ( 5 cm ) . the spoons can be considered as boullion soup spoons . 
i am not sure , but all i can say is they are good spoons for soup . i try to go usa also , but sometimes i ca n't find what i want that way . 
the length of the handle is approximately the same as a regular tea or table spoon and the bowl of the spoon is about 1 3 4 inches in circum . sorry did n't have a ruler handy to measure , i can tell you that my wife remarked that she really liked the size of the spoon ... i would presume she meant the bowl size since previous to buying these she had been using a teaspoon to eat soup rather that a tablespoon . i also found the bowl size to be very comfortable to eat from . 
8 spoons separately 
i chose to buy this set specifically because all of the spoons were the same size . my wife is ataxic , and needs to use spoons more than any other type of flatware . however because of her problem , we lose spoons down the garbage disposal a little too often . having a set with different sized flatware would be of no use to me . 
medium weight , a simple and very usable design . 
the depth of the bowl is about 1 3 '' . 
the depth of the bowl is about 1 3 '' . 
imagine all the 16-year-olds who would love to have beer delivered directly to them by ups ? mom and dad are going away for the weekend . i 'll have 2 kegs of beer overnight delivery by saturday at noon . 
target stores 
the only way home brewing would be an option is if you were able to reuse an old barrel . i doubt stores sell an empty barrel . 
no but it is still awesome ! 
yes it does . my only issue with the system is finding the refills . they are not sold in most areas as of now . i had to call many local budweiser distributors until i found someone that would go through the trouble of locating and getting me the refills . good luck ! 
i 'm not sure as i have never seen one for sale . however , i have heard people having success contacting inbev or the draftmark team and getting old-new stock 
i only wast able to use once so i do n't not where to buy another but i will sell you my 
each refill is a 1 gallon refill ; which is about the equivalent of 10.5 cans of beer . this produces great tasting beer ; and since you can pour exactly the amount you want , i believe it is worth it ! 
no . this is basically a big can . once the can is open thats it . in other words , can you refill a `` normal '' beer can ? ... ... ... ... no you ca n't . too bad though . 
i gave the set as a gift , but my guess is that the glasses are 10-12 oz . the decanter should hold a normal sized bottle of liquor 
dear tessa if you place an order anytime from now until 3pm est on wednesday 10 15 it will ship out on 10 15. we use ups ground for this shipment . i believe the travel time is 3 days . if you want further help or have questions , please call our office anytime after 7:30am est and we can help you . 866-495-4521. thank you , alan schneider , crystalizeonline.com 
it 's approximately 3 1 8 '' at the top . i have the tovolo ice spheres and they fit nicely in the glasses ... with a quarter to a half inch to spare . 
lots of bubble wrap ! each glass is individually wrapped . i would n't worry about it getting damaged while being shipped . they really take lots of measures to ensure the package arrives in tact . 
yes , this set can be monogrammed ; however , this is not a service that we are set up to offer on amazon.com . 
i gave one to my son and son in law for christmas so i have n't seen it since then but it is about 12 inches tall give or take an inch with it 's stopper . 
i seem to remember the instructions saying not to , but i have run it in the dishwasher every once and a while 
it stays on warm setting until you turn it off manually . it is not a very hot setting , just the temp that you would want your food for immediate eating . 
crock pot is actually the brand name of the original slow cooker ( still made today ) . since the patents ran out many years ago on the design and function , many companies now make slow cookers , but they ca n't call them a crock pot due to legal issues that may arise . 
no you ca n't switch it to warm , i do n't think they are designed to do that , the 'warm ' function goes on after your set time is done . i love this crock pot my meals come out perfect ! good luck ! 
the heating elements are on the bottom and around the sides of the slow cooker . 
mine gets too hot to touch 
yes it is , which makes it much easier to clean . but if you 're planning on transporting cooked food it 's best to take the whole thing , since the clamps on the lid hook only to the outer portion . 
well i saw that to and was surprised . i have other crock pots that have the lock lid and i always locked it first . i suppose maybe because of pressure buildup . 
the lid is glass with a nice squishy rubber seal around it . 
no . the 'programmable ' part only lets you set the amount of time you want it to cook on high or low . 
the outer part and the directions are from china , however , the ceramic liner does n't say where it was made , only that it was imported . 
the only thing i can think of is to check that the batteries are facing the right direction . one up one down one up one down . 
it is stamped , made in china.it works fine so far . 
funny you should ask . i just encountered the same problem when i had to change my batteries for the first time day before yesterday . i ended up using a pair of pliers ( it turns really hard ) and discovered also that i had been turning the dial the wrong direction ( my brain is old , you see ... lol ) , i was turning right instead of left . i thoroughly dusted all the powdery substance the grater had accumulated and it went back together smoothly . working like a charm again . good luck ! 
no . 
it does n't hold a lot , but i never found one on line or in a department store that did . i have never measured , but i would say less than half a cup or so . wish i could be more specific . however , it is so easy to take apart that how often i need to refill it is really not an issue . i am happy with this grinder and highly recommend it . 
no 
not a lot -- maybe 1 2 oz ( 1 oz , max ) or about 1 3 cup . here 's a secret to all electric pepper grinders : use small peppercorns . big peppercorns will clog most of them , this one included . i love this item ; i have one for salt and one for pepper . 
good question ! i 'm assuming it would work since the seeds are hard . the fact that there are different settings to chop finer or thicker would also lead me to think yes , it would work . i would try and tell you but my flax seed is already ground ! ! good luck . i will say i love this pepper grinder and am considering getting a second for salt . the product is great ! 
there are 2 reamer sizes -- 1 small and the other medium . the medium should be able able to juice a grapefruit . there is no auto reverse . i love it and 3 of my friends ordered it after they saw mine ! 
85 watts ; it works beautifully . you ca n't go wrong . i use it just about every day . 
yes 
no i 'm sorry i do n't have the warranty details 
probably , but no way to be certain . 
yes 
i do n't think so , pomegranate might be too hard for the juicer 
yes , in the `` up '' position , the opening is sealed , and there should be no drips . 
hello andy ! this juicer will be great for juicing citrus such as oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits , etc . this unit uses a reamer to juice . 
plastic 
it is 7 3 4 '' tall . the opening is 1 3 4 '' tapering at the bottom . it holds approx 4 oz of liquid . they work great . 
i just put water in it , put the cap on , and shook it . it does n't leak . unless you squeeze it , then it will leak . 
i usually run some warm water along the sides of it for about 10-15 seconds and then it pushes right up . 
they stay on okay but i would n't put yogurt in them and send them for lunch . i filled mine up with juice and had to be really really careful when putting then into the freezer so they would n't leak . 
i also threw out the box just last week ... i know the company was based out of the us , but i do n't remember if the box said anything else about where they were manufactured . if you can zoom in on the picture of the box on amazon , i think it has a website . maybe the information is there ? 
it is very dark but not black . 
15 '' wide x 19 5 8 '' long x 24 '' high 
the material the table is made of is heavy and finished on both sides . is not or does not feel hollow but has a heavy solid feel instead . the finish is nice , seems to be a painted surface but could be an applied film of some sort i guess . i 've had the table for several months next to a reef aquarium for storage and pump . it cleans up well and has n't been affected by any splashed salt water , but does seem to nick and or scratch fairly easily . a couple of tiny white spots have occurred , probably nicks , but overall are n't a problem . i would use a good spray paint primer and then follow with a coat or two of the color paint of your choice . it should accept the paint just fine , and the primer underneath will help the paint to hold on for a long lasting finish . i bought the table thinking i would paint it black before assembling it , but when it arrived the `` cherry '' finish is so extremely dark that it looked black as is and did n't need to be painted . it sits next to the black base of the aquarium and they sen to match , without ever painting . perhaps some of the tables ship with more of a `` cherry '' finish , but mine shipped looking very black . i love this table , it 's perfect for our needs and the only table that i could find that even came close to hiding and holding that aquarium equipment and supplies . i use it with what was designed as the back , facing out so that it presents as a solid front . it 's exactly the size that is described on the ad . buy it and paint it , you will be glad that you did . there 's nothing else out there that has this unique design . the caster wheels seem a bit small and plastic but they have held up and work just fine even with the heavy stuff that we store on the table . you need to assemble this table . i used some wood glue in addition to the hardware that was supplied . i 'm not sure that that was needed , but water to make sure that it was extra strong . the shipping styrofoam is helpful for balancing and propping the parts up when assembling the table . it goes together very fast , but make sure and follow instructions . 
it 's wooden , but it 's design prohibits too much weight . that being said , i think it could handle 20-30 pounds without a problem , but i would n't stand on it if i did n't have to . 
yes , it 's easy to assemble and required no extra tools . it only took about 20 minutes . 
it looks like real wood , but i suspect it 's particle board with a great finish . 
overall : 19.5 '' l x 15 '' w x 24 '' h ( these dimensions are available under `` product description '' ) 
no 
not a lot of info with the mach.it all guess work . look at the book nothing was said about the dishwasher 
yes you can . 
how do it make soy milk ? do it cook soy milk ? 
yes it does 
i believe you can . almond is not too much harder than soybean . 
i used 1 time to blender very light soybean with water , it was motor burn right the way 
110v 
you can configure it to whatever height and width you want . each cube is approximately 14x14 . i 'm not excited about the product and am going to sell it at a yard sale and find something more durable . 
no . in fact simply do not buy these ! i have had them in my son 's room for several months now and almost all the doors are off of them , the plastic is pulling away from the wire frame and all i have in them is my 4 year old 's clothes . i have never felt more ripped off by a purchase than with this one . 
the system is highly variable , but to really extend you need to purchase another instance of the system 
yes they were . i loved them . 
this comes as flat panels . you can assemble in multiple configurations . if you do n't include a back panel , you can get as many as 3-4 extra cubes than shown 
no 
i want to know the height , width , 
i love it 
no that wo n't happend it nice when used on a flat surface but it 's not sturdy or portable at all . 
it can be used without the doors and is still quite attractive and structurally stable . 
the individual cubes you build are 14.5 '' deep , but you can configure the build , so your final height and width are pretty much up to you . i have several and if you build them without the back panel , you can get a couple of extra cubes out of it . i also left off the top panel of the row at the top . 
pretty firm . the whole thing is pretty good . but if you really over stuff the shelves like me , they have started to slip open every now and then and i push them back in . 
holy sweater collection batman ! yes you 're fine . assembled correctly it is pretty sturdy and can be made into a shorter wider shape if your sweaters are made outta metal or something wierd . 
yes 
i 'm not sure , but it falls apart very easily . ours is still sitting in pieces on the floor until we figure out a better way of keeping it together . 
yes , it can be assembled any way , but keep in mind , you only get as many walls as shown here . since the 2 middle rows here share a few walls , you would n't have enough to split this into 2 equal separate halves . you could do a different configuration but you would have to go smaller somewhere to have enough pieces . 
i believe it 's no more than 30lbs . but i 'd say between 20-30 lbs . it 's great by the way . i 've moved across the country with it ... i own other dressers and chests ... hard to believe such an affordable solution could be so effective 
plastic , makes a great display 
hi i have a 16 month old who weighs about 24 pounds who likes to push the chair up to objects and step up on the back to climb and the foam barely gives on her . also the foam is fairly firm on the part you sit lay on but is still comfortable feeling i have even used it as a pillow a few times . the arms give some when you lean on the side but have always bounced back and according to the tag on the bottom the width measurement of the seat from the inside of the arms is 16 inches . not sure if it will hold up 7 years but we have had ours about 6 months and it still has the shape it did when we first got it . hope that helps . 
yes , my 17m old sits and leans back on it with no issues 
i do n't believe that you can buy replacement cover for that if is torn revenue rips in it and a big not big trips you can so it search it up it 's not i recommend you just buy a new one they do n't cost a lot on amazon i 'm about to buy another one for little girls first birthday party the marshmallow chair is a perfect gift for a little girl for the ages 1 or 2 years old 
i would say that it is a bit small for an average size 5 year old . it 's sits very low to the ground . i bought it for my almost 2 year old and it is the perfect size for her . 
it is not waterproof . if a spill were left long enough i 'm sure it would leak through . 
two infants maybe . i think it 's really meant for one child . 
yes . mine has a zipper . this is a fav at our house . 
yes of course 
my 18 month old loves , loves , loves the couch - and i can see it lasting for her at least a few more years - but i would n't recommend it for a 5 year old . i do n't think that it would offer much support if they try to lean back on it . certainly not if they lean against the arms , as they already bend a little for my 18 month old . 
fairly light ... .im not sure only a few lbs . 
it measures 18-1 8 '' x 11-3 8 '' x 3 4 '' and was made in china 
yes , works on induction 
yes you can use it on a gastop . it 's heavy gauge stainless steel . no seasoning required . 
mine measures 22.5 inches from outside of handle to outside of handle . 
yes but it warps easily and is not made for cooking . terrible sticking problem even if you use oil . worst amazon purchase ever , sadly . 
approx 2 inches , also i just want to add this is a great heavy duty griddle , it does n't warp like all the other griddles i have had . it is also easy to clean . 
nothing ever sticks . i just soak in warm soap water . 
i do n't know what they are..but i am very pleased with the performance of this griddle so far , we have used it twice on a double burner gas range . i used to have a cheap griddle but it warped and rocked on the burners . 
have not noticed hot spots . it does take awhile to heat completely , so until it does , the space between the burners is `` cooler '' for a time . have cooked bacon and eggs many times . starting with the bacon first , the pan is evenly heated when it 's time to put on the eggs . 
yes you can cook pancakes on it . add a little olive oil and they wo n't stick . 
the bottle does come with a glass that fits nicely on top . additionally , there is a very slight reservoir on the top that catches any residual water from the glass , keeping it off the table . very clever ! 
packaging was very weak , in fact i had to return the item after it arrived broken . i was really bummed , as it looked as nice as the pic . not sure where it was made . if you shipped overseas it would arrive in a couple dozen pieces unless they have significantly improved the wrapping and protection in the box . 
it is one bottle with a top . 
it could , i never thought of using it for that purpose . it is a lovely piece . 
yes . i use mine to store mouthwash in my bathroom . i have run it through the dishwasher many time . it 's just glass and its pretty sturdy too . 
it holds 28 ounces . 
i 'm not sure , but what i can tell you is that is nice for $ 15 not $ 40 ... 
a 15 lb . bag did not quite fill the container . i would say 40 lbs . would require a larger container . 
11 x 15 x 9.5. the seal seems pretty tight . 
i do not know if it is dishwasher safe or not . i bought mine to hold 25 # bags of sugar and flour . it is to big to fit in a home dishwasher . 
no , it 's not large enough . it would hold the turkey , but not the brine , if you 're doing a liquid . i 'm using a 4 gallon bucket for 13 lbs . 
11 '' 
i 've never used this in the freezer , but i got curious and poked around a bit and can find no mention of freezer use anywhere for this product . but , a similar question was asked regarding another size ( lustroware b-2896aa smart locks jumbo keeper 2.1-gallon food container , large , white ) and was answered `` unofficially '' as follows : `` i think it would do fine but am not sure how the clamps would fare being opened while super cold . i would let it set out for just a few minutes before unsnapping them . '' 
they have seals . 
67.2 cups 
the label indicates `` made in japan '' 
with lid - 11 1 2 inches ; w o lid - 9 3 4 inches 
let 's put it this way : i have washed it in the dishwasher , no problems yet . 
unfortunately , i do n't see a recycling mark of any type on this pitcher . 
yes , the label indicates `` boiling water - 212f 100c o.k . '' 
yes , with the following conditions . the opening on your water reservoir needs to be big enough to allow you to drop it in . also , you do n't want this plugging the water as is comes out of the reservoir either . oh , you may not want to use it in steam evaporators if there 's a chance it could reach the heating element . 
the homedics cartridge is about an inch long and barely 1 2 '' wide . the info on the package says it will treat 1 gallon of water for about 40 fillings . depending on the volume of water in your humidifier ... it should work . it is a small gamble ... i am using it in a non-homedics humidifier ... a dual tank walgreen 's . i place one cartridge in each tank ... each of which is just slightly over 1 2 a gallon . it lasts 6 weeks of daily fillings . 
this is my review : 1.0 out of 5 stars does n't work , january 17 , 2015 by holly `` healthnut '' ( provincetown , ma ) - see all my reviews verified purchase ( what 's this ? ) this review is from : homedics uhe-hdc4 ultrasonic humidifier demineralization cartridges ( misc . ) did n't work at all . white dust all over all hard surfaces in the area . used it with homedics cool mist ultrasonic humidifier model # uhe-cm25 
yes . i have used this in our for the last year . i change them about once a month . because we use our ultrasonic humidifier every night . 
i used it for ultrasonic humidifier for medium to large rooms and i did not find it to be very effective in reducing removing white dust 
according to the instructions , they will last 30-40 fillings of the tank . in my case it is about every 3 months which is similar to the older filters . 
yes you can . if you have really hard water you will get a white film on your furniture . even with the demineralization cartridge i have a white film on my furniture , but we do have very hard water . i still have to clean the dang thing . 
i never award 5 stars ... 
nope 
i have queen size . 
i love love love this bed set ! ! ! its more of a dusty rose than pink and it is exactly as described ! it 's very soft and cozy and washed dried beautifully ! the two toss pillows that come with it are super cute ! ! i would buy them separately if it werean option ! ! i chose to use a medium sage green sheet set and wow it is gorgeous ! i would rrecommend this set for the price ! ! it 's a win win ! 
thanks for your question ! i did a quick search of our catalog and we do n't have this item available in full size . you might like to browse the 'customers who viewed this item also viewed ' section of the detail page for similar items . i hope this helps ! 
hello kellie ! they are a standard 8 oz jar , however they will hold 10 -12 oz of liquid easily . ( at the bottom of the threads . ) thanks for asking . you can use the lids again on any size standard mason jar . 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 24 and 32 oz . : ) 
hi ! the jars are definitely dishwasher safe . i would be careful with the lids . i 've had them for almost 3 months and decided to wash them by hand and let them air dry . i have noticed small sections that started to rust . my recommendation would be to wash the lids by hand and dry them immediately . the jars are super cute though and a hit with our children guests . 
sure thing rhonda ! 12 jars , 12 lids , and 14-16 straws ! thanks for asking ! 
hello ! 12 jars , 12 lids , and 14-16 straws ! thanks so much for asking ! 
it 's two pieces the cut out and stamp of face . 
they 're about 2 inches in diameter ; pretty small . will work for a 2-inch cookie but not as a sandwich cuter . unless , you 're making cute ( very small ) sandwiches : ) 
yes it is . 
i have as of yet not received this . sorry i can not answer your question . 
yes 
works very well also 
melody , it comes with an adaptor to use about 3 different sizes . it can take 1 2 id inside diameter , and 1 2 '' outside diameter , and an adapter for around 3 8 since the tubing will actually stretch . in that regard it 's pretty flexible . however , i feel this unit is underpowered . i used it to repair my wifes wall-hanging fountain which has 3 pitchers of water . the pump has to lift the water about 2 feet from the bottom pitcher to the top to keep the cycle going , and it can barely do it . it 's very weak . try a higher powered unit , but the sizes usually get bigger with power , so check your limitations for room . 
i do n't know it it has a filter but i am using it in my front yard water feature that has a small waterfall with a catch basin and it works fine , i have n't had to clean it and the water feature does have algae in it , it works great , i would not hesitate to recommend it and the price is excellent . 
does not come with tubing but home depot has tubing . take the adapter that comes with pump to match the diameter with tubing . 
yes you can use it outdoors . right now i have it in a fountain out side on my patio and works fine . 
i like the adjustable feature so no matter the size of the fountain ( within reason ) you can have it flow as you like . i just have to use filtered water since mine gums up in a couple of days . just spin the dial and get the pressure you want or need . 
first try pump alone in pan of water.even on lo some water should flow thru . there is a dial on side of pump minus to plus . turn it to plus for maximum flow rate . if nothing comes out it probably is defective it should move one half inch tube of water around one foot up 
if not hillbilly stills & mile-hi both have excellent recipes & instructions on their sites . 
well , yes and no.as far as i know , the federal law pertaining to stills are fairly rigid and enforced . this still , however , does fall within the guidelines set out : 1 ) you can own a still as long as the capacity is 1 gallon or less . while this still advertises a 1 and 1 2 gallon capacity , it 's usable capacity is certainly not more than a gallon . 2 ) you can not make alchohol with it ( without a special license and that alchohol produced is only for racing cars , not human consumption ) . you can however make perfumes and spice extracts ( like i do ) with a still of this size and be perfectly within the law . so , no . owning a small still it is perfectly legal ; using it to make actual moonshine on the other hand is verboten . you `` probably '' wo n't get investigated for it . 
gallon and a half . if you were to make moonshine which i do n't it would make about 4 pints depending on your mash . 
sure , sugar cane and black strap molasses 
not very much ... ! you can find out the difference on a bunch of pages on it out there on the web ... 
it is small , only 1 1 2 gallons . will fit on standard stove ( under range hood ) 
mine came with a glass jar as a thumper . however , it was pictured with the thumper . you should check with the seller . also , i am very pleased with the operation of my still . 
if it leaks a little and i 'm sure it will just use some flower and water mixed together and use it like calk works great . 
in response to your question about recipie with cook times , the only way i 've found is through you tube or find a local store that sells wine and liquor making kits as a hobby . i wish you a good batch ! - greg 
the kit is complete . it comes with everything pictured . all you need is a recipe for moonshine , which seems to be the hard part . 
not at all . 
they stay on a magnetic strip fine with the sheaths removed , but not with the sheaths on . the sheaths are made of a firm plastic , which is not magnetic . 
very sharp . 
my daughter says usa 
you can try contacting the shun knife company online and see if they can direct you . they are the ones who make the kai pure komachi knives . i bought a magnetic knife strip from amazon and my knives sit on the strip attached to the wall so they are within easy reach . it 's an alternative to trying to track down another sheath . 
in order to find out , i googled the knife set and discovered them on the shun website . that makes them japanese , who are known for superior knives and blades , in general . just the name kai komachi is a tip off that it is japanese but it 's always good to make sure . hope this helps . 
yes . it is a good habit to sharpen after each wash. but , i dont always do that and they are still super sharp . 
they have warranty for it . you can send them in for a replacement or have them sharpen the knife for you . it 's free but you have to pay for shipping . 
i k ow carbon is stronger then stainless steel . percentage wise i 'm not sure . 
nature of the business , i would think . `` to the buyer beware '' as the saying goes . shop around , find the best deal that suits your needs . do you want to use up your car and gas mileage , ( maybe hop the bus , or even train ) , or is it going to be less costly to buy online ? will it possibly save you valuable time or will it end up evening out ? if you find you need to return it , what options do you have ( i.e. , free return label , etc . ) , either way and how will that possibly affect overall cost ? takes a bit of figuring out what works best for you . btw : as of 12 25 2013 , i ca n't even find these at costco anymore . darn ... 
if you scroll further down the page , you 'll find the `` product details '' section -- i pasted the info below for you product details product dimensions : 48 x 18 x 75 inches ; 43.6 pounds shipping weight : 43.6 pounds ( view shipping rates and policies ) 
i think it is chrome plated . it is a great product . we bought it to go in our community assoc . 's clubhouse and it fit the bill perfectly . everyone has been impressed . 
seems very steady to me but it just sits in one place loaded up with dresses , shoes , belts and othe miscellaneous items . made out of durable wire . i bought a cheaper shelving system before this one that started to bend . this one has held up as a stationery piece , not sure how it would be as a rack that gets moved around since it is on wheels . it has two locking casters . 
it comes with very good casters , as shown in the pictures . 
do n't know for sure , but i really jammed this rack full of regular clothes including coats ( not leather ) . there 's no sagging , no twisting , no difficulty rolling it on the casters . metal bar is heavy duty . 
i am not sure as to the specifics - but you might review the following characteristics : load capacity , lockable roller wheels , width and depth , and the number of shelves . 
i measured it . the unit has round post at each end so it is difficult to get an actual measurement . my measurement came between 47.5 and 48 inches . the published measurement is 49.6 inches . 
the one i received is silver ( chrome ) . 
you might want to check with the manufacturer 's customer service department for an answer to your question . 
there is no extra piece on the sides to put a second rod for children 's clothes . however , you could move the shelf up to any position , and suspend an extra rod from the bottom of the shelf . you would need a extra rod , plus 2 brackets ( approximately 1 inch wide by 4 inches long ) to attach and suspend from each end of the shelf . the rod would be attached to the suspended brackets . in other words , you would be duplicating the same type of arrangement as the upper brackets and rod . hope this answers your question . 
we have ours standing in the shower getting water on it during every shower . i do n't know why it would hurt it to take those off the legs . my husband loves his . 
the product details state that it is 12 x 12 x 18 inches . 
sorry you 're having trouble . i hope this helps : the little tabs on the bottom of each leg unscrew so it has stability ... maybe adjusting the tabs so it 's completely stable will prevent it from tipping over ? i personally do just fine shavings legs , but i 've made mine very level 
i believe so . i have not seen any rust . 
no . all genuine teak `` ages '' . since it is never going to be exposed to sunlight , i do n't know if color will change . we 've had it quite some time now and are very pleased with the bench . 
i have one , love it by the way , and have sat on it in the shower and it held me just fine 
it 's very stable . a small person could sit on it . it 's well built with adjustable , leveling legs . 
18 '' tall , 11.5 '' from corner to arch , 16.5 '' front corner to front corner . fits nicely in small medium shower , only protrude off the corner 11.5 '' , has adjustable leveling feet , so your height may be a little taller depending on your needed adjustment . 
i did not put a protective coating on this table - it is in the corner of my shower and gets wet and does fine - i use it to hold my large shampoo bottle and to prop my foot up on while shaving my leg - works great 
there is a reddish undertone but it 's not too drastic 
no it is only on one side . i use mine as christmas coverlets on the beds . very colorful and elegant . 
not that i know of . 
it is 12 1 2 inches wide and very lovely . 
dear valued customer : thank you for your email . please note on item # 96534 , `` red holiday linens '' each piece is sold seperately . if you have any further questions , please feel free to contact us again . thank you for contacting collections etc . on amazon ! 
each piece is sold separately and the piece the listing is for will be noted in the title . 
the runner is 68 '' l x 12.5 '' w . 
yes , it is that good ! very satisfied 
no , it does not . 
the valve should rise once it reaches the high temperature . you should hear a hissing first and not much later the valve rises . 
there are 2 ways . shut off your burner and let the t-fal cool down automatically , but that takes time making sure the position on the . handle in the steam release position . the 2nd way is bring to the sink , and instead of soaking in cool water , let the coldest water run to one side of the cover-tipping toward the flowing water . the steam releases quite fast . caution : make sure the red button goes in to down position before trying to open the cover , as this indicates that all the pressure is removed from the cooker . if you do n't feel comfortable with this , just let the pressure come down slowly by soaking in cold water in the sink . always use caution when handling your pressure cooker . 
i love mine , the t-fal p2510737 unit . this unit is really only for pressure cooking , not pressure canning . the new types are so much easier than the old ones that could overpressurize . one thing that is really important , let the unit vent steam for several minutes before closing it to make sure you get a good seal . the instructions were not a clear on that but i knew to do it from pressure canning . 
is your ring under the lid , clean debris free ? is your heating element flame under the pot hot enough ? i crank the heat up as high as it can go and slightly massage the locked handle ( there should be a little slop with the two handle halves upper and lower sliding past each other maybe an 1 8 '' and inch ) . if you do that you can see the little orange pin in the handle locks it from opening under pressure start shaking around until the pressure building finally causes it to pop up . if its just spitting tons of water you are not using enough heat to get it to seal . you will get enough steam to condense around the valves and rim to spurt out though . so crank up the heat , massage the handle with the handle switched to lock when the orange pin starts to jump around , after the pin completely pops up and you have a true seal , then turn the heat down . that 's all i got . 
yes it is . 
hi nana . stubborn little thing is n't it ? when i first tried it , i thought `` wow ! this thing ai n't right ! `` , but it 's just made that way . i assume that 's because the assembly has a slight spring pressure that keeps it from coming apart before you 're ready . there are two small `` nubs '' on the shaft of the orange plastic assembly that prevent the thing from just coming apart . you need to exert a little more force and it comes right out . i would n't use pliers or a screwdriver ... well maybe a screwdriver ( extra vodka please ! ) ... but not a mechanical device . i hope this helps you out . ( it seems to come out easier each consecutive time . ) have a great day . tony 
mine did . i love this product and have been using it at least twice a week since i got it . 
i did n't find the yellow knob to be cheap . i find it to work quite well . 
it actually comes with a permanent filter 
i honestly do n't know . did you break yours ? bella has a website - customer service could answer that better than me . would like to know what you find out so please post ! good luck ! http : www.bellahousewares.com beverages coffee-and-tea 
no , two . i love mine ! 
plastic 
i really do n't know . 
i emailed the parent company and they gave me the customer service phone # in canada to call . i did and i have a replacement cup on the way ! customer service line at 1-866-832-4843 , from monday to friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm eastern time 
no 
it 's plug-in . 
not sure if mine was just stretched but the gasket to mine kept falling off . eventually it came off while blending and was destroyed . never could find an exact replacement , but after some measuring i found that a 60mmx56mmx2mm silicone o ring should fit . turns out they do ! you can order a pack of ten through amazon for $ 5 . they are a tighter fit so they do n't fall off , so i 'd say they 're better than the original gasket .

p 's no cones will flit and if you want paper get small with the flat bottom . i have to say i have not used paper in a long time . even with my mr coffee or my black & decker 
that is correct and it 's one of the easiest ones to ever have . the basket just pulled out washable and easy accessible.i love it.very easy to use . 
hmmmm ... .that is odd . did you accidentally choose a reduced cup brew ? i think it has that choice i. programming , however , i have never used it . i have never had mine brew only 1 2 a pot either . 
i did a simple search for `` replacement carafe bella orange 13845 '' and the first result took me to http : www.bellahousewares.com beverages coffee-and-tea collections-coffee-makers orange-dots-collection-12-cup-programmable-coffee-maker-13845 where the first question is about an orange replacement carafe and the answer states `` please reach out to our customer service team to find out more about what is available for replacement parts . here is the number 1-866-832-4843 . '' 
we had the same problem . i think it was a sensor . we only had ours 2 weeks or so and returned it for a refund . 
i just looked at mine . it is 60hz . i am sooo loving my new bella programmable coffee pot ! no more k-cups for me ! 
no 
yes i wash mine in the dishwasher every day 
rebecca i hate to say this but my wife and have had this for a few months we have yet to use it because we ca n't figure it out either . we ca n't bring ourselves to return it because its just too pretty sitting there . we just moved our old one to another counter and use it . sad , huh . 
hold down the start button to shut off 
i 've had this coffee maker for about sixth months ... .love it ... .and it measures 14 '' tall x 8 '' wide . 
as long as you have the time of day set up that you want the automatic brew to begin , ( such as the next morning ) you just press the 'auto ' button one time , and then a small clock signal shows on the screen . at the appointed time , the brewer should come on . mine works fine . 
no filter . filter basket . 
hello its better then my betty crocker coffee maker it does n't taste burt after a couple of hours .i hope this helps you 
the 'dots ' are concave , not raised . they are not that deep and it has n't proved to be a problem when cleaning at all . 
no it does not . when you are working within the settings it does , but once you are done , maybe 30 seconds after , it turns off . 
if you mean the cone shaped melita type filter , then no those will not work with this . while it is touted as having a `` commercial grade permanent basket filter '' so no paper filter is required note that it will accept a standard 8-12 cup basket filter such as is used on mr. coffee , black & decker etc . the bunn sized basket filters are too big . just a regular mr. coffee sized one will work . on mine i get too much sediment using just the permanent filter , your results may vary depending on the grind used . with the paper filter lining the permanent filter inside it makes cleaning the basket much easier also . it is a great coffee maker and makes an outstanding brew . next best thing to a commercial bunn . in fact it has features a bunn commercial pour-over does n't and uses tons less electricity . 
i put both of my thumbs under the little red lever located right above the clock and `` bella '' while placing my index fingers along the top edges of the coffee maker , and it opens with slight pressure . it locks rather securely so it does take a little more pressure than most other coffee makers i 've had . good luck , and i hope this helps even a little . 
after you set it once it will stay set at the time you set it for all you do after setting it just hit the auto button once and do it fast do not keep your finger on the auto button 
when i looked on line i could n't find a replacement carafe here . i would go to the mfg on-line site if you want a red one , but that could be costly . the other alternative is look for one on sale here & by the entire unit . save the base in case the 1st one burns out ( they do n't last forever , but thus is my 1st time buying bella . or go to a bath store & buy a 12 cup regular one . it is the same height as most std 12 cup machines , but you will not get it in red . 
set clock press hr button select the hour press and hold hr to toggle quickly press min button to select the minutes press and hold min to toggle quickly when the correct time is displayed press sel the coffee maker will make an audible beep sound . good luck it is easy 
yes it does . 
no i use the mesh . it works well . 
that does n't sound normal , unless there 's just a tiny bit of coffee left in the pot . any coffee pot will scorch coffee if only a little bit of coffee is in the pot , but it usually takes much longer than an hour to scorch . i would assume the coffee pot is defective if it 's doing this within an hour . i 've never heard of being able to turn down the temperature on a warming pad , cause usually it 's not needed . 
yes . the regular size paper filters work just fine and i think they do a better job filtering the coffee grounds than the permanent filter . 
it 's great for no overflow ! i have n't had a problem at all . however , with my last coffee pot , a cuisinart , i kept it on a tray , to keep the overflows from running all over my counters . 
do n't buy it = pos 
it is a drawer with plenty of room ; i put my grandson 's laptop and mouse in the drawer when he is not visiting . 
no 
no , it is manufactured wood 
29 1 2 inches 
dimensions : 30 inches high x 42 inches wide x 28 inches deep thanks , john c . 
dimensions : 30 inches high x 42 inches wide x 28 inches dee 
2 trays . one each green and purple blue . thanks . 
i have never tried it but i think most tupperware is microwaveable 
yes 
there is a spout on the pot you melt the gelatin in be careful though , it comes out fast and we only use 3 gelatins instead of 4 . 4 makes the gummies too tough 
i 'm not sure but the molds are silicone so they should be ok 
my kit arrived without any edible ingredients so the appliance is soy and gluten-free . you have to supply flavored and unflavored gelatin . 
designed in california 
i do n't see why not . though i do n't know how well agar sets up , and do n't know if it changes the taste any , as compared to gelatin . try getting information from the company directly . i just looked in the booklet that came with the unit , and there were no vegan gummy worm ... recipes , but , i know there are some online . hope this helps a little . jami 
yes it does . you can actually forgo using the electric pot and use a small pan on top of the stove instead . 
you can fill all 4 silicon trays at once . there are 7 worms , 9 fish and 11 bears in each tray . 
heating , pouring , jelling took about an hour as i recall . could heat and fill molds and then eat cake before unmolding . might need a few rounds to let each kid have a turn . this could be accomplished using microwave extra molds . 
we used jello with additional gelatin and had good results . try different jello flavors , ie the jolly rancher ones ? 
it does n't say on the box but i bought it for my 9 year old daughter for christmas . 
12 '' long 10 '' high and about 4 `` wide . nice to take lunch in 
yes it does 
its a thin sliver fabric . it works well enough and is cute . it does keep thing cool . i put a small ice pack in mine 
i bought this , and checked on the bag .. does n't say where it 's made 
it is just perfect for a lunch bag . about 12 x 10 '' or so . they are awesome for the price . also , insulated . 
it does not have a content label attached , but i suppose it was made in china due to the fact that it shipped from there 
i believe so . 
i 'm 5'9 , if you want to use it to maybe cover feet up and most of chest while watching a movie , then yes . its about 6 feet long , so after a sleepy night of moving around , it wont cover you all that well . its super soft , and i love mine . 
thank you for posting your question . unfortunately this item can not be shipped to italy . an easy way to check if the item can be shipped to your location would be to add it to your cart and then click the `` proceed to checkout '' button . an error message will appear if it is not able to be delivered to your destination . if you are able to proceed through the order process you will be shown shipping methods speed prices to chose from . hope this helps 
china . i did not know that before i bought it . 
there are three blades total and two of them can fit in the base for storage while the 3rd one is in use ( or in storage ) . so yes , there is a place for all 3 blades for storage 
they will be long spirals 
yes its made out stainless steel . 
yes , the original sticker was on the bottom . 
as far as i have seen there are 4 different colors for this model . there are gd , rose gold , brown , and chacol black . i did order rose gold but i have got kind of brown . then , i sent a feedback but no respond back . one thing that i want to emphasize , the coating is very thin . its scratch easily ( during shipping process ) i have to keep it as the return cost is so high fromthailand to usa . 
the interior of the mug itself is stainless tell . liquids in the mug will touch the lid ( which is plastic ) when it is tightened onto the mug . 
hello , no we are not related to starbucks store any how , moreover , this tumbler from last christmas collection so its discontinued . this item is fullfilled by amazon , so you will get it very quickly , it will be shipped from the closest amazon warehosue 
no defects , brand new condition . 
standard insulated starbucks tumbler i have no idea if it is linned inside the walls sorry 
no , it is just over 8 '' in height 
i believe it was bubble wrapped , but i honestly ca n't remember . sorry , it was awhile ago . but it was in perfect condition . hope this helps . 
it is just cardboard . i did not even use it . 
yes . the top and middle shelves are adjustable with two positions each . 
i am a petite woman but pretty strong . i put the bookshelf together myself . it was n't easy but also was n't incredibly hard . i did not apply the back board so that helped . 
it 's true white . 
30 1 2 inches 
unfortunately , the shelves are stationary . i use mine , all three of them , in my sewing room , and they hold bolts of fabric and sewing accessories . my grandson put them together , and all is good . i have been very satisfied with the purchase . good luck ! 
yes 
at 9.0 that is a good alkaline level . the filter should be change every 3 months . also clean your pitcher every two weeks . 
from the same site that sold the pitcher or just google filter for the pitcher of life alkaline water 
the filter is made in hong kong but the media inside comes from the usa . it does not add sodium . 
is it - charged ? probably not that 's what turns oxidants into antioxidants.this system produces the best water i 've tasted in my life honestly ! will not be disappointed & # 128077 ; 
we use only reverse osmosis water in our pitcher and it makes the most smooth tasting water ! we love it ! 
you can and should use the alkaline water for all water to be consumed , but you might not want to do all your water at once if you are still just starting use of alkaline water as it can clean you out rather abruptly . 
the pitcher does come with one filter included . 
no 
transparent 
it is good quality for the price . ca n't see the stamp . 
honestly , i am not sure . i purchased one chair as a test to see whether it would work with my new aerium dining table ( glass top with wood and fish and turtle swimming . i can tell you the chair is very comfortable for a person 5 ' 6 '' to 5 ' 10 '' , and it seems very sturdy . unfortunately , it looks too small when beside my particular table . 
thanks for your question , according to the suppliers page , this chair measures : full dimensions : 37.2 '' h x 21.4 '' w x 21.8 '' d seat height : 18.66 '' arm height : 26.38 '' weight : 10.6 lbs i hope this helps ! 
yes , you just ca n't see them in the picture . they are built-in to the leg itself . 
did have a box spring ? if not amazon has a different frame for mattress only 
the legs of this frame are square . if the bed risers allow for square legs , then the risers could be used . 
if you proceed to check out you will see it says free shipping . 
i do n't believe so . there were only two attachments which are for the headboard . 
as far as i know this is only for a queen size mattress 
i am not sure of dimensions of an extra long twin , but this frame measures 66 '' x 55 '' . my double bed is 3 '' longer but it 's ok . 
yes it 's the distance from the floor and yes its lower than my last frame , especially if you want to store stuff underneath . however , the frame is very sturdy and i like it . 
i do n't think there is a narrower setting . you may have to buy a frame for the top bed which is designed to have a bed underneath . i had a regular frame on the top bed and the legs were in the middle . hope that helps . 
i 'm not sure . i have a queen mattress with a box spring and my bed sits up pretty high . i have a7 lb shorkie and he can barely jump up on it . ( although he 's not allowed on the bed ) . however , when i 'm at work i have a feeling that he 's up there ... bed skirts are pretty standard to your mattress size . i believe twin beds have extra long twin and regular twin . 
hello there ! this heater has one heating chamber that contains two commercial grade 14 '' wrapped quartz infrared elements . 
dimensions : 21.1 '' ( deep ) x 9.84 '' ( wide ) x 25.4 '' ( tall ) 
i had previously bought the 1500 watt smaller model last year and thought that one was the greatest heater ever . when i saw they had a little larger heater i bought that one this year and am totally amazed at how quick it heats the house up and is whisper quiet . i would highly recommend this heater to anyone in the market looking for a good heater . it heats the house up fast and is n't on constantly like the smaller model . i hope this will help anyone out that is trying to decide which model to buy . as for the brand , it is great , no problems my smaller heater still works fine . the smaller model is great for heating the bedroom up quickly and it does n't run constantly now that we have it in there . 
you can set it at a temperature and it will keep the area you are heating at that temperature . we keep ours at 72 degrees and it is very comfortable . when it reaches 72 degrees it shuts it self off and comes on again when it goes below 72 . 
20x20x15=6000 sg ft. so no ! 20x20x8=3200 sg ft which would be a normal ceiling height would still be to much for this heater to work properly . you would need four of these units to heat it up properly . 15 ' height is your biggest problem . 
use a regular 120v outlet 
it is not noisy 
yes a 3 prong 110vac 
just bought this unit and i ca n't really compare it to the ls-8wqh but the ls-1003hh heats up my tv room space in an instant . 
i have this unit ls-1003hh and it 's great for a living room family room size . but it does not heat up a 1800 sqf unless it 's the size of an entire one room size . my living room is about 500 sqf and it 's ok but the heat does not transfer to the ajesent room . 
yes , this frame will hold a king size mattress and the box springs . what we found , was that for a king size mattress , they actually sell you 2 xl twin box springs . this frame is very nice , i was impressed with its quality . 
it says in the description . 7inches . 
i have a full-size compack bed frame . the place to attach the headboard is at the head-end of the frame . depending on where the attachments are to be within the headboard would determine whether it would fit . the place for the screws is inset from the side edge of the frame . i imagine these are more or less standard . 
sleep revolution compack bed frame king size should accommodate your king sized mattress at 76 '' x 80 '' . 
if they are the standard 38 '' wide , yes , they will fit into a king frame . http : www.beddingexperts.com mattress-sizes-chart 
not sure but i loved ... 
yes ! you can attach it to a head and foot board it has slots where it can be screwed in on all for sides 
we bought it for a queen and its adjustable 
no much . you wo n't have that problem at all . excellent frame 
the plates to attach the headboard is 4 1 2 inches from the floor to the bottom , and 8 1 2 inches from the floor to the top . there are 4 holes for bolts to go through for a head board . i can not measure their height without taking the bed apart . sorry . 
yes ; standard size 'under-the-bed ' boxes containers ; naturally . 
the king hangs off the end so you dont constantly hit your foot or leg on it , its so perfect and sturdy 
inside dimension is 53 1 2 '' 
only a head board , not a foot 
not to my knowledge , unless there is an additional kit . i suggest asking the manufacturer . 
no , all of mine were there . contact the seller . you must have gotten a bad one . 
it held my queen size box spring and mattress without any problem . the construction is much sturdier than my old bed frame . 
it is not adjustable 
i bought the queen size so i ca n't help with how the full size is but if your box and mattress are bigger i would assume it would n't fit . 
non adjustable , very rigidly a queen size frame 
definitely ... ..we do not have any headboards in the house . over this bed and frame we have a wall hanging - no headboard , no problem ! 
nope . you 've got a 6 1 2 inch clearance underneath this bed , that 6 1 2 '' is measured directly to the start of the bottom of the frame itself . ( source : i just measured ) 
we have ours on carpet with no problems . before placing the mattress and foundation on the frame , i put a carpet slider under each leg . this makes the bed really easy to move around should we need to . 
clearance is about 6.5 '' . 
i 've had this bed frame for a while now & there 's no squeaking or shaking , it 's very sturdy & secure . hope this helps . 
there are rubber `` feet '' on the end of the steel legs to prevent dents and marks left on your floor . 
box springs work fine . if you want a foundation , it would support 1 2 or 5 8 '' plywood easily , too . 
not in the manner you might think . the way it is constructed means that to erect the frame , you have to extend the legs , and it would be impossible for them to fold while it is erected . i was very happy with the way the mechanism of the legs is constructed and have no concern that the frame could ever collapse through normal use ( you would need to bend or snap a substantial amount of good gauge steel for this to happen ) . 
the feet are square so it depends on how the gliders attach to them . 
no . it comes with all parts needed and is easy to assemble . i bought two queens over two months ago and love them ! very sturdy with no slats needed . 
i have this in my living room and it is actually quiter than the 800 sq foot one i have in my bedroom . though to be honest i would get one of the smaller ones that are much cheaper for your bedroom . this unit puts off surprisingly little heat considering it claims to be for 2000 sq feet , i hear good things about the dr. infrared heater 1500 sq ft one , but i do n't own one of those so i ca n't personally attest to it . 
yes it does 
18 inches high , 15 inches deep , 14 inches wide 
yes it heats a larger space faster , & yes it casts a little more.. 
it would take about 6-8 hours to reach desire temp on high setting 
no it is too heavy . 
no , it warms my 24 x 13 living room but no more . 
hello there ! this model comes with a one year manufacturer warranty . 
every time you first start it up it at 72 
hello there ! this heater is a 1500w model and therefore , it is about 5000 btu hr . 
casters wheels ... yes 
no , but like every other appliance , you do n't want to overload the circuit you plug it into . it will use 1500 watts which is almost a hair dryer . i have been using over a month now and have not noticed any dimming of lights or flickering when the heat comes on . 
the dimensions are 28-1 4 '' wide x 10-3 4 '' deep x 22-1 2 '' tall . 
it would have to be turned back on . i hope this is helpful . 
yes with good insulation in the square footage allowed yes . insulate your pipes as well . this heater blows good heat . i used it in my living room . 
it should be fine . but you will need to remove the wheels . as long as it 's not snug against the wall , you should have no problems . 
hello there ! the btus for this unit is rated at 5100 . 
yes , just take it out of the box , plug it in , put batteries in the remotes and it 's ready to go . 
yes , we move it all the time . 
yes 
no the base is metal and does not scratch my wood floor 
22 '' - we really like them . 
ive never measured exactly , but i have really tall friends and really short friends and the chair has never been a problem . just lift up or down as desired . 
usually 3-5 business days . 
it 's adjustable to whatever hight you want 
no these are super simple to put together . they look great too 
hi there , i purchased these stools for the sole purpose of using it as a prop at a kitchen & bath show . i do not recall seeing any yellow tinge to it but then again we only used it for three days . i went back and looked at the photos of our booth and the stools seem pretty clear to me with no yellow tinge at all . hope this helps . 
thank you for your interest , these stools do only come in sets of 2 . 
250 lbs . 
yes , it is available in king . but , we are currently out of stock . 
yes . 
hi sydney , you 'll get a comforter , bed skirt or dust ruffle , two pillow shams , 4 decorative pillows , 1 sheet set with fitted sheet , top sheet and two pillow cases . the packaging was perfect , pillows are filled with a very good foam that was nice and full when i opened the package . great price and i absolutely love this set . hope this helps . ps , the colors are true to the picture . 
the lacquer finish protects the copper so i would n't want to remove it . 
i do n't know where they were made . however , they matched a set that was not purchased on amazon . ours do n't spot while drying . 
these mugs are made of pure copper with no inner lining . this is really good because most mugs are lined with nickel which gets eroded and mixed with the drink which results in nickel consumption ... .that can be bad for health ... so pure copper with no lining is the best ! 
yes 
this are nickel lined . 
copper 
yes they are lined with nickel ! 
yes . with nickel 
this model of mugs are smooth and not hammered . 
our mugs are not embossed . 
no . 
its not loud persay , does make a brewing noise but it is like 30 to 45 seconds . i think it would be fine.. : ) 
i have to use a water bottle and had to learn by trial and error ( took less than a week ) how much i needed by the size of the coffee mug i was using . 
we use our local grocery store brand of pods . they work just fine . 
the bottom cup rest is removable , but i just measured mine & i think you 'd be missing the distance to slide under by a 1 16 '' sorry ! 
as far as i know all of them . it does not really specify . i just use my own coffee in the little brew filter . works the same without the cost of the k-cups 
i 'd say no . with the bottom base removed , it is 8 inches ( maybe a bit shy of 8 inches ) from base to the bottom of the filter cup . it would be a very tight fit if you were able to get it under there . 
i do n't use a travel mug but it will fit a 32 oz . quart jar which i tried for measurement purposes . however it only handles 1 cup of water per shot so it would tak about 4 cups to fill . 
about 14 oz 
no , simply for brewing . 
depends on how sharp your dogs nails are . my dog sleeps on it and its fine but he does n't purposely claw at it . like any other bed it will tear if he she claws at or digs at it . 
the box is like 4ft tall and pretty heavy abt 60 lbs . you def need to air it out for about a week . 
have had the mattress since december 2013 and there has been no need to do anything to it except launder the sheets ! i love this mattress it took about a month to get used to feeling like i was laying on a rock ( because it is so supportive ) but now it just feels good to crawl in ! i suspect once a year or maybe twice i may vacuum it and rotate it but as of right now there is no need to do that but old habits do die hard ! 
i am on it for about six months , now , and i do n't see any evidence of sagging . i am queen , on a platform bed . 
it is pretty firm . costco carries quality pads . i would look for a pad with cooling gel otherwise it will get a little hot . 
yep ! that 's exactly what i did . : ) 
it would be a pain , but no more so than any other mattress . 
no 
i do n't use box springs- i have an ikea bed utilizes slats , and this mattress sleeps fine on it . you can use box springs or not . 
no 
sleep innovations really only offers the one level of firmness and it 's pretty firm . i read through a lot of the reviews and went with the 12 inch and got the full size 3 inch thick , 4 pound density visco elastic memory foam mattress pad bed topper by memory foam solutions to go with it . the combination makes for an extremely soft bed and still keeps you at a very low price . 
every review i have read says they wish they would have bought the sleep innovations mattress for $ 400 ish instead of $ 3,000++ you can see some reviews on sleep like the dead forum site . i have a sleep innovations mattress and it is surely the best i have ever had in nearly 50 years . also , if there is ever a problem with mattress you take a photo of it and fax or email them a request and they mail you a new mattress no questions ask not that you will need another one ! http : www.sleeplikethedead.com bed-mattress-review-home.html 
platform style beds are the best . but i kep my boxspring from my old bed and set the ned mattress ontop . i was 4+ feet in the air 
i 've had mine for 5years now and still like brand new . 215 lbs man to boot 
yes , simply because you want to protect your investment . be sure to get a deep pocket one as this mattress is very thick . we still love ours and will never go back to a conventional mattress 
this is a sleep innovations 14 inch mattress . ... as shown it has a twenty year warranty . .go to their website ck it out for yourself . ..best mattress l have ever slept on ... 
yes 
if u have a few thousand dollars go to the store . i 'd rather buy this one and save money though 
this foam is dense , provides support excellent . i had a real hard time believing this would support my like a conventional mattress the layers help does not sleep hot . as far a a 4 to 5 i ca n't rate it this way i ca n't compare to any other mattress i shopped for a solid year finally had some friends that had purchased this same mattress over 2.5 years ago and they were larger people that were still satisfied 
is this the one that costco sells ? 
your slats will be fine . i have my mattress on a trundle , which is very similar . i also have another foam mattress on ikea slats , so you 're good . ( y ) 
mine felt almost warm or moist and soft when i got it . we waited two days to sleep on it and it 's firm and nice now , and the smell diminished by then . i think it 's best not to sleep on it right away , some people have claimed that it needs time to set . 
i ca n't remember exactly but if you go to the sleep innovations website you will find all of the information listed . at one time i believe amazon had a comparison chart also , but if they no longer do , go to the manufacturer 's website . i love this mattress , i think you will be very satisfied with it . 
i do n't know about the 12inch sure temp because i bought the 12inch gel swirl . i did n't get to go to a local store to try them out so i went based on reviews . the 12 inch gel swirl is pretty firm . i do n't sink in super easily which is what i was trying to avoid . it cradles and curves to me without making a massive dent like some foam mattresses i 've tried . 
the box is 30 x 30 x 48 at least . my adult son could crawl into it . 
have not owned it long enough to evaluate durability . seems well constructed . have not had an issue with being too warm . i have a tempur pedic on which i occasionally become too warm . have slept very comfortably on the sleep innovations without any heat issues . mattress is very firm but is comfortable once you lay on it for a few minutes . 
i 've just taken a tape measure to mine . it is 11 1 2 . 
we use to have the tempurpedic . that was a hot bed . this one is noticeably cooler . it 's very firm . almost too firm . if that 's what youre looking for then go for it . 
the main difference is that the gel swirl has temperature control so it does n't get hot in the summer . you can call sleep innovations directly for your firmness question . i know they are both about the same firmness . the sure temp ships faster . ( i 'm waiting for my gel swirl ) 
that is why i bought the mattress , and i found that my back pain is subsiding since i got it . 
yes . any surface to place the 12 '' mattress on will work . i tried the mattress on the floor and the mattress felt fine . i had to return the mattress because the mattress was to firm for my small frame . 
yes . 
i would like to know the same thing . returning from 33441 though . 
the gel makes it cooler to sleep on ... .if you are the type to feel heat from memory foam , the gel is the way to go . 
lol no . there isnt as much give as a normal matress but neither one of us noticed any complaints 
i believe its 10 years 
there is jo need for a mattress pad unless you want a softer top . this matters is very firm . also very think so adding another 2 to 3 inches would make it even thicker . think about that when buying sheets . putting a top would make the gel useless . buy the 10 inch mattress if you want to put a topper . 
46 inches . 
here 's a blurb from the owner 's manual . `` construction is moisture-resistant but we do not recommend full immersion of the cable . '' 
i dont think so . it works perfectly with the chefalarm though . 
yes 
the high temp pro series probe is six inches long after the bend . 
you need to get the foam tape , it 's a closed-cell foam tape with adhesive backing . thermoworks sells it ( this brand ) . you can insert the probe into the bag without leakage and the probe can take the water exposure . 
should n't have any problems getting ithe probe into the kettle . when i bought the thermometer it had a clip with it.. i 'm not sure if the probe by itself comes with one . i do n't think it does . you will need one . you could probably use an extra spoon to clip it to.also the needle probe is primarily used for meat . the standard probe is all you will need for candy . hope this helps . 
a little over 40 inches . 
yes it is and it works much better than the one it came with . i use this one in my oven and on my bbq pit . i have the chefalarm by thermoworks 
i think yes . read the full description of the dot thermometer . your answer is there . 
no . i ca n't think of a single reason why you 'd want to , tho 
the instant read probe will not . the high heat probe will fit through a 1 4 inch hole . 
yes . 
yes but put the wire thru the hole at the side of the bbq ... . do n't clamp the wire down with the bbq lid . there should be a natural hole created by the lid and base of the bbq when the lid is closed . for tri-tip roasts i do leave the probe in . i do n't normally leave the wire probe in for stakes.. when i am ready to test each steak , i just scoot the steak over to the far front of the grill and insert the probe into the side in the middle to get the temp . i am usually cooking several filet or other steaks at the same time so i test each steak one at a time . 
the packaging says it will only work with the chefalarm . 
total crap . some only lasted one use . brushes sheared off very easily . buy the item from roomba . 
i think they will work for all series 7 roomba models . you might need to replace them every six months out so . 
yes ! they work on my 650 . 
no screws were included . just remove the olde brush ( screw in center of brush ) , put the new brush on with the existing screw . 
i would say generic knock-off , although the term sounds more derogatory than necessary . they came six in a clear plastic bag , with no brand labeling . however , i have found them to be completely compatible , and totally satisfactory . no quality issues , in my experience . 
yes , they should work fine . 
it fits the 650. does your brush look like that one ? 
yes they fit fine 
china 
plastic body and stainless blades 
no problems at all . what are you defining as a small apple ? 
yes 
you can cut an apple up to 4 inches across but you need to peel it first . if it 's that big , it 's hard to cut all the way down easily . i had to lean over the counter and put all my weight against it . i was afraid i 'd break the handles off . but once i peeled the apples first and did n't use real big ones , they cut through just fine . i do like the second part . you flip the bottom up and out , slice almost all the way , then return the base and press on down to cut all the way through the apple . it 's amazing and i really like the 16 cuts instead of 8. enjoy yours . i do mine . 
this is not but we do have one made by progressive that gives 2 sizes this is the upc on it : upc : 019578161006 
it should be called the `` hinged pusher '' ; you flip that cover out of the way , push the slicer down over the apple . the apple goes all the way through except for the width of the blades . you flip the cover pusher around and push the apple out of the slicer . do a few apples , it works great ! 
do n't really have an answer but i 've often found huge variances in prices among the different vendors offering products on amazon . i have the red one with charcoal gray solid color bottom and it functions very well . some apples are more resistant to the blades than others . in that case i bang the loaded apple and cutter against my cutting board . i 'm really happy with this purchase since i love to spread peanut butter on thin apple slices and this makes light work of the preparation . 
they seem to be the diameter of the average size bun . i would say 4 to 4.25 in . i have been using 5 to 5.5 oz of meat to make a patty , which creates a good balance between meat , bun and condiments . the dimple feature results in nice flat cooked patties . almost exclusively i cook these on an outdoor grill . 
a light spritz of cooking spray every couple of bugers works for me 
not necessary . as long as you use the plastic insert , the formed patty peels off easily . 
i do n't think so . the indentation in the center is for the burger to cook evenly . i prefer my burger press from tupperware . the burgers get stuck in this press . i even tried a suggestion from another customer and spray the press with cooking spray . still have to shake the burger out of the press . 
4.5 inches . great product lightly oil the inside of the press to make removal of the burger from the press easy 
this is taken directly from their website . `` what is bpa and how is progressive handling it ? bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a chemical commonly used to make polycarbonate plastic , a clear , shatter-proof material . progressive makes a conscious effort to avoid these materials when designing and producing our kitchen products . we do however have two items in our line that are made from polycarbonate , our microwave butter melter and drip-less poultry baster . '' 
i found that when i know the colors of the measuring cups and spoons , it is easier to use . the white measuring cups are broken down as such : 2 cup , 1 cup , 1 2 cup and 1 8 cup . the gray is : 1 3 4 cup , 3 4 cup and 1 3 cup . red is 1 1 2 cup , 2 3 cup and 1 4 cup . for the measuring spoons : the gray is as such : 1 tbsp , 1 tsp . 1 8 tsp . red spoons : 2 tsp . 1 2 tsp . 1 16 tsp . white spoons : 1 2 tbsp , 1 4 tsp . 1 32 tsp . i have to hold them up to a light to see the clearly , but knowing the colors and sizes , it is pretty easy to figure out . hope this helps . 
yes , the ml is listed on all of the spoons except the dash , pinch , and smidgen . 
yes ! all measurements are written on the handle . 
raised measurements - still love these ! 
they are , according to type on box , made in china . they are also dishwasher safe and the handiest measuring set i have ever found . thanks for asking og happy new year ! ! ! 
1 cup is about 236.6 ml and 1 tbsp . is about 15 ml 
there is no indication that this is available , and i suspect that 's because it is n't . ma'am , i used to have a mail-order business . if i got the cups for free , it would be a breakeven operation at $ 8 to read your mail , process your payment , ship out the cup you want ; boxes are expensive , and both ups fedex charge an extra $ 2 for residential delivery . and people would ( justifiably ) complain they were being overcharged , and if the color did n't exactly match what they already had . these spoons and cups are *incredibly* cheap and amazon is geared up to handle shipments efficiently ; they 've obviously negotiated deals for packaging and shipping . . if you need to , buy another set , and you can use the spare cups and spoons in with products like brown sugar , loose tea , etc , for convenient use . 
yes 
nope , they come as a set only . i do n't know of anywhere you can buy one piece of a measuring set . 
i have been using this for at least 2-3 years , it has never dulled . when using these , you must be very careful ! they are very sharp . if you use it for vegetables that are too small for the holder , be very careful . 
you probably can not use only one hand because its weight is too light for most things you would cut . it would probably move around too much causing a little frustration . with that being said , it is durable and easy to use with two hands because it is solidly built . the blades are very sharp and durable and it is pretty easy to control . i hope this answered your question . : ) 
yes it has 4 inner metal pins . 
around 3 '' or 3 1 2 inches 
it would work with hard cheese like some reggiano but have not tried it on that . just vegetables.very sharp ! ! : ) 
yes , it has a blade that can make fries . 
yes , 3 different levels of thickness as thin as 1 8 in . 
the largest available cut you 'd get with this mandolin is 1 4 '' thick . the width of the mandolin `` trough '' itself is 3 3 4 '' . note that the size of the vegetable also plays a factor -- it can not be more than 2 1 4 '' across for it to fit in the `` holder '' part . as for available cut sizes you have 6 options of 2 types : slices and strips , ranging from 1 4 '' to 1 16 '' . 
there are no instructions for reordering blades in the manual but the website provides an 800 number for questions or requests regarding replacement parts . 
hi karen ! there are three slice thicknesses : 1 16 '' , 1 8 '' , and 1 4 '' . there is also a julienne blade . janet 
i use it on my glass top . it has a smooth aluminum bottom . i have had no problems at all . 
i would n't think so as they seem to be some type of plastic rubber material covering the metal handles . unfortunately , this item shipped with no pamphlet from the manufacturer which would give specs on this . disappointing . 
the box it came in says 21 quarts . it is 9 inches tall deep , and i 've canned quart sized jars in it . if that helps . 
this does not include a jar rack . i bought one at a local hardware store . 
it takes a long time to heat the water . and , on a flat top stove , the temp drops off and on as the element heats . 
i have this pot as well as the ball canner . there is very little difference between the two . i use both on my smooth top range without any problems.it will hold 7 qt or 8-9 pt jars . 
i ca n't answer that ! i bought my rack at walmart and it works . 
yes 
yes , but you would have to be making a huge batch . i have used it for making everything from cheese , to apple sauce , to bone broth . 
i have used it on high heat on a ceramic top stove , and i have had no issues . i have mainly used the pot as a canner . 
hi cynthia , i had the same problem but realized i did n't take the plastic caps off of the metal rod that you push the seats onto . these need to be removed first and discarded . hopefully that will fix your problem . 
lowest position is approx . 23 '' from floor . highest is approx . 31 '' . 
no , they are very easy 
i do n't even know , these stools are going to charity now as they were terrible quality and i was not happy with them at all . the plastic ring on the bottom to avoid floor scratches lasted about 2 weeks , the chairs started tipping forward as well as other things i was not happy with . good advice , save your money because when you see them if you want to send them back , the return shipping costs almost as much as the stools . 
i 'm sorry i do not know . i had ordered brown . i do not recall having a problem with color verification . sorry i could not be more help . 
yes i believe there was an allen wrench . however assembly was super easy and no real tools were required . 
not sure , but probably about 10 lb . each ? 
the instructions for mine were in each box ( i ordered 4 ) . in one box , it was at the very bottom if the box . it 's one sheet of paper , so look thru everything . 
seat of the stools are 171 2 inches wide 14 inches deep ( front to back ) . backs of the stools are 171 2 inches wide and 13 inches top to bottom . 
i weigh 200 lbs and they do ok for me but i do n't think they could handle very much more than that.hope this helps 
if purchased from homebrewstuff , the caps are black phenolic lid with a polycone liner . the polycone liner is a conical shaped liner made of an oil-resistant plastic . this lid is perfect for chemicals , solvents , oils , essential oils , alcohol , cleaners . 
i received a dozen that i recall averaged $ 0.50 each , but offers vary . make sure the offer you buy is for a dozen . some sellers actually charge $ 5 for one cap . when i purchased a year ago , my seller charged about $ 6 for a dozen . i received great quality caps ! i do n't know if these fit the gt kombucha bottle . 
i received a dozen but you must find such an offer , since some are each . read the item page carefully and ask the seller if unclear . i sifted through a lot to find the dozen offer for this price . 
just one cap . yes it 's very pricey . 
the picture is 35 '' tall by 24 '' wide 
i 'm not sure how it would affect the canvas but i think it might cause the wood frame to warp . 
the level of the glow will depend on how much light the print gets during the day . ours gets a fair amount but at night the glow is very subtle . 
it 's not the actual size . not sure about the availability .

there are setting for 3 languages : english , korean and chinese . 
yes . it comes with multilingual directions and a cooking guide . the cooking guide however , is only a few pages .

english manual is available for crp-hz06 ( 220volt version ) which has english korean front panel too . take a look . why the us version crp-hz0683f front panel is still not ? https : www.dropbox.com s i88uz5iziv9gba0 crp-hz0683f % 20 % eb % af % b8 % ec % a3 % bc % ed % 96 % a5 % 20 % 28383-885b % 29.pdf 
the other answer is incorrect . please refer to page 20 of the product manual where `` gaba rice '' is listed as one of the modes available . page 24 goes into detail about how to use that mode ( http : www.cuckoomallusa.com emanual english crp-hz0683f % 20english.pdf ) 
there are multiple sellers who sell this item and they offer different pricing . you may click `` more buying choices '' on the right column . we have n't changed the pricing , but maybe the one listed $ 29 changed the pricing to $ 39 . 
this item will be shipped from california 's warehouse . 
several minutes if you continuously press the button . it does n't take much to make the mist work well . my 5yr old had it most of the time and he definitely misted anything and everything within reaching distance for hours ! 
yes , you have to give it a few pumps . 
they came together in one package . so 2 in 1 box . 
yes , but you will have to empty the bottle and then fill it with water inside the airplane . 
it has a carabineer for easy carrying . 
i do n't think it would hurt it at all . 
very subjective , but i 'd say it 's closer to the `` virtually silent '' end rather than `` really noisy . '' it 's not loud at all . 
the bottle holds 10 oz of water . the mist will last approximately 10 minutes of continuous mist ( exclude time to pump multiple times ) , but normally no one uses it like that . the mist lasts up to 1.5 hours of intermittent use between refills . 
the bottoms are rough which was a disappoint , but they did stay in place when placed on a plastic tray . 
dear amazon consumer , yes the product is lead free . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey , consumer relations 
i believe the dinner plates are 9 '' . i have not seen any chips in my dishes yet . 
no , not for me . 
dinner plate is large & very thick so do not stack well in dishwasher . i 've not been at all happy with set not due to that but how they 've scratched with normal silverware use . do n't waist your money- not worth it . mine are white with a ton of scratched that look a decade old & they 're only a few months old ! very disappointed 
the dishes are white with preferred color accent . my sets just had too many flaws to keep 
yes it can 
i measured and 'unofficially ' the mugs are 14ish oz and bowls are 20ish oz . love the set - very bright and sturdy ! 
hey lenore ; i own this rr set . they are very nice as i like the rustic hand-made look and feel . the dinner plates are diameter 11.125 , and the bowls are diameter 6.25. i hope this helps . 
china i think . 
my husband loves it , great for wood stoves , or inserts in your fireplace , fill it water , helps humiity in air . 
it is small - holds about 2 1 2 cups of water . it 's easy to refill but use pot holders ! the whole top comes off .

and why after buying this `` hz 980 '' i received hz 970 , and even used one ... heater itself maybe good enough , but the seller is to be aware off ... 
yes , mine had an odor but it only lasted a day or two . 
10 
i bought 2 of these last year and had problems with both , one fan did n't work and melted front , other one makes alot of noise and quits after about an hour , i have to unplug let cool down then i can restart ! ! good luck but both of mine are junk ! ! 
no , the timer is strictly a shut down timer . also of concern to some is a power outage will cause the haeater to stop working and it will need to be manually restarted . i expect both of these features were designed this way because of safety concerns , for instance a heater starting in a dangerous environment while unattended . 
120vac ; 60cycle ; 1500 watts ; thermally protected . very nice indeed . 
the one i boufht was a 980 . 
yes . 
yep . i really like mine ! 
if you have solar panels it runs for free . 
1500 watts 120 volts 
the etl logo from the us is shown on the box in which the heater was shipped . that is the only indication i could find . i did not see a ul logo or mark . 
the 980 has a few more features than the 970 ( 2 available temperature settings , etc ) . if you pull up the specifications for each you should see a couple more listed for the 980. we went with the 970 because it was more affordable and worked perfectly for our needs . 
sorry , i do n't recall . ( my guess would be it 's 970 . ) in the overall scheme of things , the small differences you 're asking about , would probably not be noticeable with this unit . 
i returned heater because it did n't work properly 
120 volts 
i do n't know how that product works but my honeywell works extremely well and is energy efficient i would use any other heater because this honeywell does everything i need a portable heater to do and it does well in large rooms to !

yes it will automatically shut off after it 's finished cooking . 
yes it does . 
two at a time . the hard boiled ones are the best . so easy ! ! i am happy with this product ... 
yes , i 'm getting burn marks on the plate and eggs . i would also suggest making the pin holder round so it 's easier to poke eggs . 
yes the manufacturer states it is bpa free . 
yes . you just plug it in . i use it five or so times per week . great well priced product . 
all i know is that it takes about 13 minutes to do hard-boiled . 
no there is n't . just set a mental timer for 10 minutes . for the money ... this egg cooker is really fantastic ! 
hard is 4 tablespoons . medium is 2 tablespoons . soft is 4 teaspoons . 
it states on the bottom label that it conforms to ul std 1026. hope that helps you . 
on a previous egg cooker i had , they provided a piercing tool to prevent the eggs from cracking or exploding while cooking . on this model i find no significant difference whether i pierce the eggs or not . some open whether pierced or not , so i have stopped piercing and occasionally one opens and some of it 's contents goes to the bottom of the cooker . but it is relatively infrequent , so it is not a major nuisance . i agree that the instruction booklet is somewhat lacking in certain details . 
metal 
if it 's hard boiled egg it takes about 6 mins and i just put mine in cold water with ice for a couple mins just to cool them off a little to make it easier to peel but you do n't have to run cold water over them or let them sit if you do n't want too . it 's a great egg cooker . i 've used it to poach eggs and hard boil eggs and every time they have come out perfect . the only problem is the `` alarm '' is n't that loud . 
absolutely . 
it 's very loud and you have you manually turn off the unit for it to stop . i find that it is a very good item 
just turn it on and it beeps when finished . 
it is plastic 
i lost mine on a trip this last fall . i only make total hard boiled eggs , so fill to the ridge above the shallow well ... so it is a thin solid puddle that fills and just touches the bottom of the eggs . i just made a batch today for egg salad ! 
i 'm sorry but i have not used the measuring cup for that reason . i plan to try the cup again , because if you do n't use something , it is just hit and miss . i really like the egg cooker , it is less messy and i love the poached egg unit ! 
i like my eggs cooked hard , and i do n't think this could be accomplished with adding extras . the machine is meant to soft poach eggs ... they come out soft and with a goopey middle ... not sure an omelet type could be cooked right . 
good morning , dz . thank you for your inquiry to plow & hearth . the table meaures 14 '' l x 42 '' w x 30 '' h. i hope this information is helpful . please let me know if i can be of further assistance . sincerley , sarah-plow & hearth customer service

hi . not if you have proper ventilation . i always set mine on the stove right under the exhaust fan and have the window on the other end of my home open just a little so there is a path for the air to flow to the fan . this works for meat that is not real fatty . now if you are cooking burgers or brats it 's a good idea to also have a fan pointing outward in a window next to the grill to take care of the extra smoke . this is a great grill . i have tried three or four different kinds after they banned gas grilling on balconies and the others were terrible . this one cooks great food and is very easy to clean . 
there is much more room than an inch . the top is like a real grill lid . it covers the meat or food being grilled but does n't come close to touching it . it 's not a press at all . 
12 inches wide x 9 inches deep

not really , food is not pressed down..so stays juicy and you can cook meats with bone in . however , like all inside grills..it does n't taste like char broiled food ... 
this is a grate type grill . the length is 15 inches and width is 19 inches . hope this helps . 
i do n't know the wattage , but i have done hot dogs , hamburgers & bbq chicken on it . i love it .

on the wall around the painting 
yes , in my opinion it is . the picture is absolutely beautiful without the `` glowing '' effect . it glowed the very first night i hung it even though i have a northern exposure in my bedroom . it 's sort of like looking out a window late at night on a foggy evening . you see a black silhouette of this majestic tree . also , you have to take into consideration that it originates from romania and travels through customs in nyc and all shipping fees , taxes , etc . are included in the price . 
hello , it is a real photo .

my canvas trees lighting is beautiful any time of day or night , we added special lighting on them when we want to show them off . 
sorry , now we know what you are referring at . yes , there is one picture which states that if you purchase a 31.5 x 47.24 inch you will receive an extra gift : the gren leaf key holder ( it 's a kind of advertising for another model ) . you will find this picture also in the presentation of other models of paintings . thank you , ina grecu startonight service center 
dear madam , thank you for the interest shown in our products . the picture presented is the standard one and represents a painting with the dimensions of 47.2 x 70.86 inch . in us we can deliver only 23.62 x 35.43 inch and 31.5 x 47.2 inch because we are conditioned by the shipping policies which do not accept larger sizes . if you are interested in the 47.2 x 70.86 inch we can send to you only the print , not streched on chassis . otherwise , we would recommend the 31.5 x 47.2 inch size , because we have an offer for 109 usd insted of 149 usd . there are 2 pieces left for this offer . many thanks and best regards , ina grecu startonight customer service

it 's a print done through a process called giclee , so it 's a reproduction . however , it 's not a print of a photograph ( glossy paper ) , but one that 's done on canvass of a previously original abstract . there is no textured paint , so the evenness is uniform and essentially `` blended in '' to the work . the end result lacks the `` pop '' of a brush painting , but offers a budget friendly version of art . this particular company is unique in that the canvass glows at night . peripheral light will negate the effect , so it is really only useful for rooms in which you will have all lights off . it 's not overly-impressive as a stand alone daytime piece , however it 's very impressive at night in a blackened room . i originally placed this in my living room , but was n't able to enjoy the effect because of t.v . and moonlight . when i switched it to my bedroom however , which has blackout curtains , i really started enjoying it . 
yes about 1 '' 
the painting is shipped from amazon 's warehouse , so we believe it should not take more than 2 days . 
it is solid wood . love it . 
31.5 inch vertical 47.2 inch horizontal 
31.5 inch height 47.2 inch length 
no . i do not think so . the effects of the daylight as well as the ( harsh ) weather conditions will take its toll on the painting . sincerely . 
it is made of canvas , not sure that it would hold up to the weather or wind very well . 
not sure , have n't used one . it does however glow in the dark and is a great conversational piece , however frame came warped and bowed . 
the logs have a strong perfume before burning . it might be a bit much to store in a small place . once lit , it is the best burning get log i have ever used . i wonder if the manufacturer might suggest ways of storing the of , like in a heavy plastic bag . 
in my experience they last around 3 hours , which is less than duraflame but , they definitely put off more heat . in my opinion , getting more heat and a good non-smokey smell is a great trade-off for one less hour of burn time . 
there are six in the box . 
they do n't smell like wood . i do n't know if i can describe it but it a good smell . we carry them in the trunk of my honda crv because we live near the beach and we realized it was the earthlogs that were making the car smell so good . 
the log takes a minute or two to fully engulf , then puts out a nice flame for two to three hours . i will definitely purchase again . 
it depends if you 're putting it in a fireplace or if you 're bringing it outside and a fire pit i burned 1 to 2 and a fireplace in the house and the same thing outside it is recommended only to use one at a time 
i 'm not sure . but , they do give off a bit of a scent , so i would not suggest using them to cook over . 
yes 
you can order each once individually i ordered 3 - the starfish , the seahorse , and the tree . you need to order the pillows separate from the covers . i was very impressed with the quality ! 
turquoise 
if you buyer from us , it 's free shipping 
if you buy 4 of these pillow covers , we can give you free shipping , from for ever . 
no , dry clean only 
the all season silk comforters we sell fits well with temperature range 58f to 75f and since it is made of silk filling it touches very soft and feel cozy as well . the silk breathes so it wo n't cause you over-heated . unfortunately it is not machine washable . spot clean only . a duvet is suggested to protect the surface . 
the queen size is 90 '' x 92 '' . 
yes they are 100 % mulberry silk filled . all the materials are natural . they are all long silk floss . the zipper is about 8 '' long . 
thanks for your inquiry unfortunately our thanksgiving promotion expired on december 10 . 
it is an amazon technical issue . we contacted amazon but it can not be fixed soon . currently we are enabling the promotion offline . any customer who buys the all season comforter for more than $ 300 or $ 400 value will get this promotion and we will ship the free item to our customer directly . 
you can either do spot clean for the stained area or dry clean once per year . do not put it in the washer . suggest to use with a duvet cover . 
i do n't see why you could n't use it , providing the air mattress could bend a little where the frame raises or lift , because i 'm using my regular sealy mattress from my older bed , and it works fine . 
i just received mine ; and it is two separate stand alone bases that can also be put together . 
like a regular bed if you use shams . it is the usual height . the storage comes from no box spring . 
my husband is well over 200 lbs and he has not had a problem . i do n't know if that helps ... .. 
i purchased my mattress online `` amazon.com '' for me ! 
i 'm not sure about a memory foam mattress , but i would say it depends on the weight of the mattress . i have an adjustable air mattress , and it 's very easy to raise . in order to lower back to flat , you have to raise it all the way to 90 , then it lowers . even with the air mattress i have to make sure i let some air out before it will raise easily to the 90 position , so that it bends with the frame . might be a little tricky with just 1 person , but still wo n't be terribly difficult ! 
yes , 2 of these frames equal a queen size mattress 
yes 
if the mattress is inflated , it takes time but it can be done . put on a clean floor , bunch the skirt to the back , crush the fome with your hand and slide the skirt on , like a trash bag . might take an hour . 
we bought the six inch and it works great . you could buy the eight inch for it to be a bit thicker but probably not necessary . 
there are only controls on the top , one is for the timer and the other for the temp . i have used it a few times , and i learned fast that the pizza will burn even with it rotating . i used a lower temp ( 1-5 ) 3 and still burn on top . my daughter has another kind , and after seeing hers i bought this make , but hers never burns . i would not rush out and buy this one , i would shop around first . 
i like to make my own dough when i 've got the time . it has worked perfectly with fresh dough but you need to watch the timing for the first few . 
just the oven 
yes . very easy . the tray is removable . i personanally think it wise to spray a small amount of non stick spray on the tray the first time before using . it 's a great machine . 
is 110 v u got to use a converter transformer to 240v 
i do n't know if in germany is 110 or 220 
yes , but you still need to scrub burnt stuff off of it . 
the ul label rates it at 1200 watts , 120 volts ac . hope this helps . it works great ! pat . 
the only temp control is selecting top , bottom or both for cooking . the numbers are minutes . you turn past at least the 15 minutes and then back to the time you want to use . number of minutes needed varies by pizza type . be aware - do not cook two pizzas in a row . it must cool down completely or you risk blowing a fuse that you ca n't replace inside the unit . we have two of the makers in case we want two pizzas . it does the best job cooking pizza of everything we have tried . we also use it for other items like frozen fish filets or reheating burritos , etc . 
actually yes , but remember they will cook quickly as they will be closer to the baking coils . : d just watch for browning all the way around thru the viewing window . can also bake small pies in a pie tin , cook crust first , till lightly brown , then add filling . 
no 
yes , you can put the pot in the microwave , oven , or just about any place . best wishes .

yes with a metal rim . 
no , it does n't have a rubber seal , but works beautifully . this is the best slow cooker i 've ever had . 
yes , the insert is removable . it 's stoneware so it 's not light but not so heavy you ca n't deal with it . 
no it is a regular black ceramic type cooker . 
the lid is not hinged , the back of the cooker has a metal stand that you can rest the lid on . when not in use , it flips down and keeps the cord wound . 
i 'm not sure where the 8.6 '' comes from . the actual cooking pot is oval shaped and approximately 8.75 '' w x 11.5 '' l x 4.5 '' d 
it 's not good for steaming other kinds of food because the little drawer is only as high and wide as a hotdog and it 's very flimsy plastic . so most veggies wo n't even fit . if you squeeze food in it wo n't cook well because there are n't enough holes . and the top level is impossible to use since there 's hardly any steam there . sadly , you ca n't boil corn or other things in the bottom level because there 's no room at all . so you ca n't really use it for steaming other foods . 
contact the manufacturer or run a search online for directions . ours came with directions . i 've found that setting the timer for 10 minutes insures perfectly cooked hot dogs and perfectly steamed buns . be sure to not cover the air holes in the bun steamer with the buns . when they 're done , carefully remove the bun steamer lid and wipe condensation from the bottom of the lid . this will prevent the buns from getting soggy as they sit waiting to be consumed . do n't let the water reservoir run out of water . you always want to keep it at least half full while cooking . using filtered water will prevent the heating element in the water reservoir from becoming corroded with calcium . 
i plug into a 110 , i would get the converter . make sure you do not turn this on for no more than 15 to 20 minutes , that is more than enough time to cook the hot dogs . crack the top lid so that your buns do n't get wet . 
i do n't know how it would do with brats but it cooks ballpark hotdogs great ! im pretty sure they would cook as well . i set the time for only 10 minutes for regular hotdogs but it goes as high as 60 minutes . as long as the steam holes are not covered the buns are not soggy . i carefully take the lid off the buns and let them cool a few minutes . they are perfect ! highly recommend this product . 
normal outlet . it 's amazing ! ! ! 
110v 
have no idea - plugged in wall ... check ! turn timer on ... check ! water turns to steam within minutes.. check ! possible problem with your machine and may have to send back 
no but that 's a great idea ! 
yes 
i do n't see why not . if you want to steam something this would work . 
it 's pretty easy , as i believe the hinge mechanism is assisted with spring tension . i do n't believe it 's lockable , but when it 's full extended , it 's pretty tough to accidentally shut it .

the top is laminate ( and quite lovely ) and the bottom is solid wood . we have had many compliments ! 
it can support up to 50 lbs . i believe . i 've had books , laptops , a cat , and food on it at one time and it was fine . 
18 '' x 25 '' x 4.5 '' deep . the table does not tip when it is open but it will if you lean on it . i just use the inside to store coasters , etc . when it is fully open it is way too tall to use if you were sitting on the sofa . it is a good , solid , heavy piece . 
it 's really simple all you have to do is attach the legs , the rest comes put together already . 
table top 40 '' x 22 '' height 18 '' table top raises to 24.75 '' 
yes , but not abuse . and , remembering my youth with four young men , a solid table may be a better choice . 
the legs attach to the table with two screws that enter from within the diagonal brace into the leg itself , there should have been 8 screws , lock washers and flat washers as well as an allen key wrench to tighten screws . i found that you will need to adjust legs prior to final tightening to ensure they are flush with the top of the base of the table . hope this helps , dave 
to be more specific the wood appears to be dark brown , but when sunlight contrasts the color is closer to cherry ... all depends on the lighting . hope that helps 
yes it is dishwasher safe . 
i do n't know anything about the nordic ware product . however , i can tell you this much : these silicone sheets are very easy to cut with a scissors . if you are concerned these silicone sheets may be too small , there are many larger ones for sale on amazon . just buy a larger one , cut it down , and either save the unused portion , or use it for another tray . 
no , i went and checked the package and it dose not have where they were made . i do know that they work great and we use them often . 
stainless steel ... 
there is nothing on the trays to indicate where they are made ; they are extremely sturdy and solid . 
11 '' '' x41 2 '' 
yes you can if you want a whole ice tray 
not until ice has formed . 
yes and no . it 's kind of a balancing act . we did not buy the stand , and are doing well with balancing them on top of each other . i would recommend to place them in a section of the freezer where you have minimal activity . 
there are no markings on the trays as to origin of metal or manufacture .

the chord comes out on the right side of the vent next to the vent , the default location for the vent is at the rear center of the top . the vent can be moved to come out the back at the top center of the back . 
vents out the top or the back . it can be changed fairly easy . 
the exhaust can be configured to the existing exhaust if there is one . it can also be configured without an exhaust . easy to convert . 
yes 
mine is metal . 
the recirculating vent is located on the top forward end of the unit . my cabinets are also 12 '' deep and the vent clears the cabinet with no problems . if you need additional specs , i recommend you the following url on the web : http : products.geappliances.com marketingobjectretrieval dispatcher ? requesttype=pdf & name=49-40675-2.pdf 
sure , they are the same mills just packaged as singles or doubles . 
i am not sure as i gave these as a gift to my son-in-law . i do n't think it gets as fine as powder but does a good job . my son in-law loves them . 
the grinder is manually operated by pumping the top . it is nearly 6 inches tall , 1 inch diameter . it feels heavy and sturdy , and it works very well . i get compliments on my salt grinder , and intend to order a second to use as a pepper grinder . 
the coarseness of the grind is fixed . it is in the finer side . 
hello . sorry but i do n't know what you mean by block top . the top has a heat and stain resistant laminate finish . it is the whole desk as seen in the picture . 
it 's the same desk pictured . 
i ca n't give you a for sure yes or no and here 's why . if it 's put together as in the photo and instructions , you have almost 34 inches of width to work with on the right side and easily 12 inches of depth . there is a 1-inch decorative strip along the underside . the tray would have to have an arm to navigate around that or you could simply choose to not install that piece of trim when you assemble it . here 's the big `` but '' ! you would be drilling into the top surface . i assume it 's particle board under the laminate , not solid wood . ( the other visible wood parts of the desk are particle board . ) i 've never drilled into particle board and do n't know if it would splinter . the top is 11 16ths inch thick so no matter what , you ca n't use big screws . i would n't try it for fear of wrecking the surface . you should contact their customer service to see what they say . 
back of desk is not finished . it does look nice when put together . 
i bought the desk for my daughter in virginia . she does crafts and she thinks the table is perfect for her . 
yes 
not solid wood , but it 's nice 
no , this is how it look like . 
no 
i do n't think so . the right side with the lower shelf is shorter than the left side where the drawer is . the grooves are designed in specific spots to fit what is in the picture . 
no box spring needed . i bought one and the bed fit perfectly . the box spring might make the mattress to high 
hi andrea most beds without a box spring have some form of legs . these are unfinished legs and they are pretty far back and to the sides . from the angle of the photo it shows them more . however with normal bedding that hangs over the sides of the bed it should pretty much hide the bottom angle . 
small crates will , but the big plastic tubs will not . it sits low , maybe a foot to 16 '' without measuring -- currently my mattress is on the floor because the slats are n't sturdy enough to support the mattress and 300 pounds on hardwood floor - it was fine on carpet but not hardwppd 
it 's wood but cheaply make 
i bought a full size bed frame and its big enough to fit a queen size mattress . 
do n't buy this bed read the reviews . trust me ! it a piece of cr & # 128512 ; p 
no , no mattress . 
no , the headboard is not detachable . 
no mattress . only the 1 piece headboard bed assembly . 
i would think so , though the mattress ontop would be quite high up 
same as a standard queen bed 10-11 inches 
yes 
no , it does not 
i 'm 135 and husband is disabled and 190lbs . two of the six.legs are cracked to where ee ca n't use it . i highly recommend you look at s different bef honestly . 
in answering your question , box was pretty heavy and you definately need another person to help you carry the box 
it comes with the headboard and the entire frame , you just have to assemble it yourself : ) 
it would n't be heavy to move . i have not tried to disassemble , but my guess is it would not be difficult . you would just need an allen key . 
length 7 ' , width 64-1 2 '' height of headboard 31 '' height from floor to slats where you put the mattress 11.5 `` 
seriously . just skip it . find something else . 
someone else took the bed out of the box and assembled it for me , so i do n't know if there were instructions in it or not . i would suggest that you contact the seller and ask for a set of instructions . i do remember the person assembled it said that some of the holes were not perfectly aligned and he had to drill a couple of holes to make the pieces fit together . 
it 's 14inches . but it 's a difficult bed to assemble and it 's weak . good luck ! 
it 's wood but legs and slats are too skimpy ( 1x4 material ) and to hold a person over 140 lbs in my opinion . i 'm making a support frame of 2x4 for the middle under the bed . 
no it does not and one more important thing is that in the photo they put its queen but its really twin and vice verse in queen photo they put twin size just be advised . 
a little over a foot but i have box springs so the bed sits higher . this frame is only for a mattress 
headboard is 31.5 '' tall and footboard is 14 '' tall . i got the mattress that was recommended to come with it and that seems to work well also . 
the headboard height is 31.5 inches max size ( measured on the outside of the frame ) the width is 64 , the length is 83.5 i ordered a queen and ordered the following mattress which they recommended . fit perfectly http : www.amazon.com gp product b005a4on90 ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 
http : www.amazon.com gp product b005a4on90 ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 we got a queen memory foam that was recommended to go with the queen headboard . it works fine . 
1 3 4 inches apart . 
you will have to contact the seller for this question . i bought the twin size . 
inside the frame , it is 2-3 inches longer and wider than a queen mattress so the mattress does not exactly fit in the frame but it is ok for me . for outer dimensions add 3inches on the sides and 4 inches on the longer part on top of the regular queen size mattress 
at least 10 '' 
glass- but very durable - been using same dishes for 20 years ! when they do break ( like when you drop on tile ! ) they shatter into little shards ! but i love them 
plates and bowls are made in usa . 
yes ! 
very light and durable . easy to work with , and feel delicate ! 
they 're sold in a blue corelle package inside a standard brown amazon box if purchased from amazon 
i eat a lot of tomato and curry based foods on my plates , as a well as a lot of soy sauce base food and they 're just as pristine white as when they came out of the box . i love corelle . 
probably - but according to the corelle site- yes , corelle dinnerware is oven safe up to 350 f ( 177 c ) when used in accordance with the safety and usage instructions that came with your product at the time of purchase . all attachments ( foot and handle ) are only safe up to 248 f ( 120 c ) . so 350 is the limit ... 
they are 6 '' across ... perfect for a bowl of cereal ! unless you like huge portions which we 're all trying to get away from ! 
the tank holds 1 gallon . i use filtered water , and so did not install the provided filter ( which uses up some of the volume ) . 
yes , ac 100v-240v 50-60hz adapter changes voltages to 24vdc in order to operate the humidifier . 
first and foremost i think you need to read the manual that came with the humidifier.you 'll definitely need the ezcal cleaner descaler packets , and hydro cells , water maintenance system . the last item you need is an ag+ ionic silver demineralization cartridge . read and follow all the instructions . 
we fill ours with tap water and have no problems at all . then the cartridge does its demineralization process on that tap water . 
no , it usually floats to the bottom of the tank . 
i believe it is three years . m . 
they come out by rubbing your fingers against them & you will see which direction you have to rub it for them to come out full size . it is hard to describe but it is done to protect the plug . it should go back ( in hiding ) when you take the plug out of the wall after you are done . 
i have never tried that and have not noticed any label indicating dishwasher safety . i use simple green spray , then rinse well with water . 
because it is junk . bring it back 
i would use the ezcal . it 's a great humidifier if you buy it you wo n't be disappointed . 
yes -- here is a description of the product : glasses , goblets , `` cups '' or other containers to drink beer have always existed , in hundreds of different shapes , sizes and types . but to really be able to have an `` expert '' opinion on a beer , even if you are just a beginner connoisseur , it is fundamental to have a glass that meets specific requirements . that 's why , after tasting dozens of beers - from the most famous lagers to the great abbey beers - in dozens of different containers , our teo , the most eclectic italian brewer , and the legendary kuaska ( lorenzo dabove ) , the top italian beer expert , have designed the shape of the `` universal beer glass '' . at the dawn of 2006 , `` teku '' was created . its name is the rather straightforward acronym of teo and kuaska ( lorenzo dabove ) . manufactured by our friends at `` rastal '' - an industry-leading company - teku is considered the official italian glass to taste beers . its particular shape enhances their aromas and tastes and is therefore a valuable companion for brewers , beer tasters , or simply beer lovers . 
personally , i would only hand wash them . we hand wash all our beer glasses because the residual soap dishwashers leave can affect the beer taste and kill the head . 
i got 'em for $ 40 . it 's probably some algorhythm figuring out what price to set them at so no one buys them while they 're out of stock . 
i would think so . the straw that comes with it is a wide one . 
looking just now , i guess fatter straws would work with it . 
it 's not bad . the inside of the lid is plastic with a rubber gasket that comes out easily . i 've never had problems getting it clean . 
china of course . 
i have and it does n't hurt the tumbler at all ! 
it 's plastic . a lot of people buy the stainless steel straws separately ( as did i ) but i think the original straw is just fine . 
the inside of the cup is , the lid on the inside is plastic 
no fingerprints at all . i really like mine . 
yes . 
yes 
the straw is 9 inches long . 
no . there is just a hole in the lid for the straw 
no , not at all . i have the black and plain and i love them ! 
do you mean the diameter ( measure the length from the back to the front ) or the circumference ( the size of the circular base and the circular cover ) ? i am going to give you both , but i thought i should clarify which was which in case there was an error in your wording . the diameter of top is 4 '' and the bottom is 2 3 4 '' . i believe that what you need is the circumferences . here they are : top 13 '' bottom 9 '' . hope this helps . 
unfortunately , in china 
the best way is to shake it and tap it on a paper towel and let it air dry between uses . otherwise as you might have noticed it will drip on you . 
yes , a 1 4 inch straw would fit . 
never tried it without the lid , so i did . no problem with threads or unpleasant . i always use with lid but did replace plastic straw with stainless one . 
the bottom square is 12 '' by 12 '' all around , 2-10x10 '' , 2-8x8 '' , 1-top 6x6 '' and that hold the squares the tubes are 4 inch , a height of 15 or 16 inches from bottom to top 
no 
standard cup cakes 30..you maybe able to fit a few more in . i did n't want to spend a lot on a stand so i raised it by sitting it on top of my round corner wear and covered the corner wear with cheveron paper to match my theme then i put the extra cupcakes in front on the actual table.forgot to take pics but it came out nice.. oh and i put a 6 inch cake on top . 
yes it can . very easily comes apart & goes back together . very sturdy . 
no they do n't , once they 're in the slot that 's it . 
yes , i had cupcakes for on the tier about 40-50. but , i feel that it will hold a 8 '' cake as long as it has good support that the cake is put on . 
yes 
it will be a tight fit . 
i never measured the thickness , but is just right for me to use @ parties with cup cakes or tiny sandwiches it looks grear on my table ! 'll give it a 10 ' 
i would n't recommend it . 
no , only usa 
this was actually a bad choice . the plastic handle melted and i disposed the heater . sorry . 
it burned up before the water got very hot . 
no rust , however if the water is hard in your area you could possible see hard water calcuim build up on the portion that is the the water line . remeber with this unit make sure you unplug it while still in the water , wait a couple of second the take it out . mine shows a bit of melting on the portion that the plastic meets the metal props ( just a little ) because i tend to leave it in the water for longer than usual . 
i would not recommend using a foam cup , the boiler could touch the side and cause it to melt or leak . metal or ceramic is most recommended . 
yes , that is why we bought it also . 
the review by a. wiersch indicates that it was measured at 195 watts . 
yes it does . 
waffle is 6 in . can be divided into 4 3in . waffles . 
i dont think so . we have n't tried anyhow . 
this waffle maker the voltage is 120v 
they are more around 1 inch . they are always thick and delicious . 
no . 
6 '' by 6 '' inches 
yep 
i would n't know why not . as long as they can fit through the hole opening . 
nope , i compared it to the other one i had at home and it was smaller with fewer coils . 
at widest part , measures approx . 2.25 inches 
yes it is ! 
they are formed . just as picture shows they come on a plastic sealed bag . my daughter played with them and they did not break nice and strong . 
approximately 2.5 '' 
i believe so , the nalgene opening is fairly wide , correct ? i do n't think you 'd have any problems with the blender balls 
china 
both , the constant display is for the thermostat setting , but you can hold down the `` temp up '' botton for 3 seconds ( or so ) and it will display the room tempature for just a moment . 
what 's the answer to this important question 
yes it has the setting to just use as a fan i love this thing and it looks really looks nice 
ls-4ch-siqt-d , 120v 60hz 1500w 
there is a top and bottom . on low heat only the top is on . high both are on . each element is 690 watts . it uses 1380 watts on high . 
no it is just automatic or understood that it is on whenever the unit is running for heat fan 
not a large room . you need to be fairly close to it . pretty much like a regular space heater . it 's also heavy and does n't have wheels . 
here is my best gues is that it 's probably ok . it has a grate in he front that is probably tool small for a cat to out rheir paws into . i like the product . my best guess is go for it 
65 degrees fahrenheit . 
suppose to heat up to 900 sf . i have mine in my living room about 600 sf with high ceilings and it keeps it warm . 
just an fyi , there are 3 settings on this heater , hi , lo , & eco . i have four of these types of heater this being one of them and i have a `` kill a watt '' meter that i have run test on all of them . this listing on this heater shows it has three wattages using the 1500w , 750w , and 500w . this is not true , and in the manufactures ' specs ( being fair to the manufacture ) it says nothing about the eco being 500w . i believe some one that was trying to sell this heater made up the 500w setting and some others read it and decided to add it to their description . it runs in only two wattages , hi runs approximately 1240w , lo runs about 870w and eco runs both hi and lo . how eco works is a fixed setting of 68 degrees , when the temp in the room is 65 degrees or lower the heater will run at the hi setting until it is within 2 degrees of the fixed setting then it kicks into lo mode and runs at that setting until the 68 degree mark is reached . i personally have discovered there is no real use for the eco setting since i like to run the heater on lo mode ( being the most economical ) most of the time . hope this help explain the heater , btw after the entire test my show a cost of roughly $ 16.00 a month at my cost of $ 0.09 per kwh at 8 hours a day usage . 
as far as noise , it has about the same level as a fan set on a low setting . it is not really loud , but it does make some sound . it can save money on your bill , but the principle of zoned heating is that you will turn your main thermostat down significantly , and have zoned heating in the areas that you spend the most time in . for small apartments or homes where you use all of the space all of the time , it 's doubtful you will save money , since you wo n't be able to turn your thermostat down . we have 5 of these in the rooms we spend time in , and turn our thermostat down so the main heater does not run . we have noticed a savings doing this . 
its a 15 amp circuit to one plug in . do not use a extention with major appliances 
yes , if the kids are touching the top or sides . they can not touch the heating elements in the front ... it will burn them . so , if you have a toddler.. do not get it . if you have older kids who follow directions and know to not touch the front where the heat comes out ... . then get it . 
no , it does n't turn off , it resumes once power is back . 
yes , it is 110 volts and works on normal outlet . it take 15 amps though . 
yes it has rollers 
cycles when heating . 
600 
sure you can place anywhere . for small room this heater is life saver . it saves on gas bill . i never get nasal conjestion with this heater . outside of heater never gets hot . it is worth buying , great money saver never to worry about boiler repair or worry about plumber . so many benefits . for big room it may not be very very effective.. amiongest all model of lifesmart this is most economical , i have one with flam more expensive and gives less heat , so buy this model .i have 6 of this type of heaters i am using in all rooms when we are using these rooms , like our bedrooms my daughter bedroom lining room etce very rarely we start main heating system 
it 's 31 inches wide , 25.5 inches high , and 11.25 inches deep . it 's a very nice piece , and puts off a decent amount of heat . i hope this helps . ml 
yep : - ) a lot times i just need to knock the chill out , so i 'll just use heat mode alone . 
there are fans in the back that pulls air in over the heat coils blowing air out the front . if you put against the wall it ca n't breathe and the fans will over heat . 
no , but we 'll pass the idea on to the manufacturer 
i have a 40 inch flat screen on top of mine and have had since i bought it about a year ago . i made sure that the wheels are sitting on some small pieces of board to make sure it is stable and the tv wont fall off because soft carpet is unstable . 
well we have a 1 story . 1440 sq . ft home it heats it nicely . i have a terminal illness and have to keep my bedroom door closed as it heats it up . we have an open space of about 900 or so square ft. where the heater sits it heats up in about 15 minutes before it spreads to bedrooms . hope that helps 
yes , i would not have particle board 
yeah just unscrew the back to take it out 
flames - sort of . looks real to me and my wife . as for the bulb . i hope mine last for a long time . 
same thought i had and finally am bartering to give it to my handyman . i was astonished at the lightness . you would need to have some sort of heat resistant paint for the opening where the heat comes . out . a shame , because the flame effect is great . went for a smaller one by another well-known brand in cherry and black . 
extension cords are often not robust enough to handle the electricity needed by things like heaters . so , the worst that could happen is that the extension cord heats up , catches on fire , and burns the house down while you are sleeping . 
the product dimensions in the listing look pretty accurate , dont have mine at hy house , it at my work office , but that looks right . product dimensions : 16 x 15 x 18.5 inches ; 31 pounds 
yes , tihs is a very safe product and looks great too . it is also likely the best one at heating a large room because it can continuously pull 1400w on the high setting , putting out more heat compared to smaller ones and ceramic electric heaters that only really draw about 800w . they may all be rated at `` 1500w '' but none of them really draw that much when warm . having more elements gives it more heating surface area to dissapate heat , which allows it to pull more power all the time . there are also low and eco settings so it does n't draw the 1400w if you do n't need the extra heat . because it does draw more power than other units you have to be more conscious of what else is on that circuit so you do n't trip the breaker . if you have 15-amp breakers , then this thing will be drawing about 12 amps , so you cant also run a vacuum cleaner on that circuit or a refrigerator or microwave or other large device . this is advertised as 1800w in places , but in the owners manual it says 1500w . however , in the same owners manual it says it may draw up to 15 amps , which would indeed be 1800w . in my actual testing it draws 1400w continuously , which is actually about twice as good as most smaller cheaper ceramic electric heaters or any other wire coil electric heater . the fan is not loud , it is also not silent , it needs to get all that heat dissapated and distributed . the wood is always cool to the touch , doesnt heat up and the power cable doesnt get hot either like some other electric heaters . it will probably look best on carpet , because on a hard floor the legs are above the ground a little bit since it sets on the casters , and the 4 wooden legs are just a bit higher than those wheels . on carpet the wheels will sink a bit so the legs look like they are on the ground . 
about $ 1-2 a day 
no . i am supplementing 1200 sf and it does a decent job . i got it because it has higher output than the others 
so far , and it has n't been that cold yet , it seems to need about 5 '' clearance before it heats up the surrounding wall furniture . 
plug it to any outlet just be sure to periodically clean filter . 
mine stays on 24-7===== my husband is an invalid and stays like ice -- i keep thermotat on 72 and he is just rite ! i am gon na buy another one of these for my kitchen seating area . 
i have no idea . but i have the heater and i have 18 gouldian finches , and cordon blue 's in the room ! no problem , it 's awesome and they were all healthy and warm last winter . 
7000 watts is more than enough at 120v .

yes . i gave a gas range and use them on there . just be aware the top of the handle is steel but there is a plastic liner on the bottom to leave the handles cool to the touch . if you have the flame up too high and it goes up the sides of the pot it will melt your handles . if you keep the temp right , the handles are great ! 
does n't really say anywhere , but what i do find leads me to believe switzerland . i can tell you it is very good cookware . i love my set . 
the bottom of the pots are 5 '' , 6-1 2 '' , 8-1 4 '' & 8-1 2 '' . the largest pot ( dutch oven ) is bigger but i do n't have it handy to measure . i had n't heard the pot had to match the size of the burner . i 'll have to check that out as i bought an induction hot plate so only have one size burner . 
good question ! i do n't remember seeing anything in the literature that said they are oven safe . they have a plastic like insulating material on the handles that is quite heat resistant , but to what temperature i am not sure . with that said i absolutely love the set . i did notice a previous answer said they can only be used with electric stovetop , which is incorrect . they can be used on any electric or gas stove top ( mine is an induction type and these things work great on it ) . 
its ok , i would have never paid more than the $ 179 i paid , first time we used it it stained the bottom with steaming sauage 
the lids have a gauge on them . the temp is supposed to be right in the middle . if the lid spins easily , the temp is about right . if it does not spin , it is too cold and if it sputters steam it is too hot . so it is loose by design . 
i would be hesitant to personally , but the packaging does say `` dishwasher safe . '' 
i had a pan by a different maker and ruined the lid within a few days . i did not get the instruction booklet with this cookware so i am careful with the lids . i do not put them in the dishwasher . certainly not in the oven . i wash them by hand . they are ok , just not my preference . 
yes . flat bottomed stainless steel . i bought them specifically to use on an induction stove . 
hi cassie , i believe that the answer is yes ! all the pots have handles that your pot rack should easily accommodate . the two saucepans have holes in the ends of their handles that measure approximately .3 '' by .4 '' . i do n't know the size of the hangers on your pot rack , but if those openings were too small to fit , you could always go to a hardware or home store and purchase and eyelet with a hook ( that is smaller in diameter and your pot rack arm ) . you would then slip the eyelet over your pot rack arm and then use the smaller hook end to hang the pan . you just need to make sure that the hook is small enough in diameter ( less than .4 '' by .3 '' ) to fit inside the hole of the saucepan . of course it may be possible that you might still need to store the lids and accessories somewhere else . my experience is that buying through amazon ( and costco ) gives you an excellent return policy , so if you did n't like them or they did n't fit your pot rack , you should be able to return them . i love cooking with these pans , they heat so evenly ( i use them on my magnetic induction rangetop ) . hope this helps , my apologies for not getting back to you earlier cassie , when you live on a lake you 're slammed by company all summer long ! sincerely , phil 
it 's either a rayon or polyester synthetic fill that has a similar feel to down . these comforters are great for people who are allergic to down but want that soft , comfy feeling . i have two of them for our guest rooms and have been happy with them . 
it depends how cool you keep your house . we set our thermostat at 67 at night in the winter , and my daughter was comfortable most nights . she was cold the nights weather outside was down in the high teens and low 20 's . we also have a coverlet over the top , and a fleece blanket and flannel sheets under the cover so you might be just right with sheets and duvet only . have n't had it through a summer yet . 
no . it does not . i had to like spin the corner ends and then tie the ties inside my duvet cover around the corners . 
the listing is for just the comforter . 
i am using this as a duvet insert and have n't had it long enough to remove it . but that being said , unless the manufacturer says it ok to wash it of course i would not . 
this comforter is dry clean only . yet few customer have washed them in the past and then tossed them in dryer with tennis balls and worked out well . its not guaranteed though . 
mine is just like this - it is goose down - and it is very , very warm - i love it 
i bought if for my son after he moved out of the house . he fluffed in the dryer and then put on his bed . it completely fluffed within three days . 
these are filled with 100 % natural goose down filling . 
yes it is . very nice . 
yes i 'm afraid so . 
we have had ours a few months now . we keep it inside a flannel duvet and have not had any issues with shedding . hope this helps . 
i would not know . we ordered two ... received one ... which is in the guest bedroom . 
i do n't know . 
i take it to the dry cleaners ... it is too big to fit in my washing machine . 
the comforter hangs to the bottom of box spring but does not cover the slide boards of the bed . hope this is helpful . it does n't come anywhere near to touching the floor . 
the comforter has indeed some thickness to them , but not big , they are designed to be a light weight with medium warmth . 
it is not 100 % cotton . it 's 300tc micro-fiber cover . hypo-allergenic , allergy free . machine washable . it is , however , very very soft and has a pleasant nap to it . has a beautiful white hue and the stitching seems well-done . the corners have small bands sewn in that help attach it to the duvet cover ( a nice touch ) . hope this answers your question . 
i do n't dry anything . i think dryers ruin everything ; but i also live in an apartment & share a laundry room . machine wash on permanent press . and then i hung comforter to dry . fluffed up and does the job . i am using it as an insert for my duvet . 
it sure is ... .it 's great ! ! 
mine is a king size and the squares are 9 and 3 4 by 9 and 3 4. also , there are tabs on the 4 corners for a duvet cover . 
no . it was made in china 
yes 
i 'm not sure what the difference is ; however , i will tell you i am more than happy with the one i purchased . the surface texture is smooth , the fill is equally distributed in the squares ( as it 's designed ) and it 's warm . in either case , expensive or not , i do n't think you could go wrong purchasing from this company . their customer service is superior . 
fluffy is a relative term . even after washing it is not flat like a sheet but it is not two or three inches thick either but it has body . we like it and our heating system is set at 68 degrees for the cold nights we get in southwest florida . 
i would say it is a medium warmth , which is what we were looking for since we live in the south . yet , we had a 28 degree night last week and we are fairly miserly with our heat . it kept us very warm . it is light weight which is also what we wanted . hope that helps . 
goose 
full queen size is 90x90 inches , and king calking size is 106x90 inches . 
if you 're able to use your home or commercial washing machine that will work . when drying use a clean tennis ball in the dryer to fluff it up . i like to hang it outside then put it in the dryer . 
these down comforters are made in only white . but we have over than 200 duvet covers in solid , stripe , printed and in many different fabric and you can use to cover this comforter . please check our amazon storefront for these duvet covers . 
no it does n't . i held the corners as i put it in the duvet cover . just working slowly it filled up duvet cover easily . 
full queen size is 90x90 inches , and king calking size is 106x90 inches . 
not at all , very light . 
no it does not 
it says 100 % natural down on thelabelake it does not say goose 
julian , i purchased this comforter a month ago and if you are looking for something breathable this is the one to get ! not too heavy or hot at all . very well made . you will be happy with it ! might i also suggest you look at getting bamboo sheets . after much research , we also purchased this at the same time and i could not be happier with the quality and results . the sheets feel like satin and keep us cool all night . apparently they have a wicking property that lets heat escape . still have n't found a pillow that actually works yet in keeping my head from getting too hot . ( i 've tried them all ! ) 
it fits nicely ! 
cold water , delicate cycle . no chlorine bleach tumble dry low . remove immediately . 
hello , thanks for posting your question . according to the information on the product page , this is a comforter with boxed stitching so that the cover does n't move around , but can also be used as a duvet inner . this listing does not include a duvet cover . if you 'd like to confirm this with the seller that you placed the order with , you can contact them directly by clicking on `` contact the seller '' in the bottom right-hand corner of their storefront page . i hope this helps ! 
comforters are thick , filled blankets that usually have a decorative design printed on them directly . they are meant to be placed over bed linens . duvets tend to be plain white and more thickly filled . they are intended to either replace a regular comforter altogether or to be an extra cover on top of a regular comforter . removable and washable duvet covers can be purchased to add decoration to plain duvets and protect them from dirt . 
90x90 full queen that is the information on the tag 
yes , the one i bought on 1 19 2015 does indeed have the corner tabs for securing a duvet cover . based on the other comments i was expecting to have to sew some on myself . so the fact that mine has the tabs was a pleasant surprise . 
sorry it does n't 
yes . 
so far i have only used it to melt crayon pieces into animal crayons . i used it in 250 degree oven for about 30 minutes twice so far . it did that very well and once cooled the crayons came out nicely from the tray . sorry i couldnt be more helpful . 
probably about 1.5-2 inches wide and roughly 1.5-2 inches deep 
i only got one - never noticed it said 2 ? 
i believe only 1 mold is listed . it has 8 cavities and is very cute . 
i got the animals in the pictures ... .. 
we bought this and really like it . it is very easy to put on , and it fit our mattress which is a pillow top mattress . my husband gets very hot at night , even in the winter , and he does not get hot using this topper . it really helped make our old mattress comfortable again , so we would not have to buy a new mattress just yet . i like the fact that it is made in the usa . hope that helps . 
it really has kept it 's shape for me- we have had it about two months : ) 
it 's very cozy now since the weather is quite chilly . i ordered it because it 's supposed to be cooling and until the weather changes i wo n't be able to tell . however , manufacturer info included with the pad does not state it to be cooling . 
would n't see why not . check sizing of your mattress . some dorm mattress are sized different then regular mattress . 
you would use a fitted sheet over it . 
i suppose you could but the mattress pad is built to fit a deeper mattress and may be somewhat lumpy . my mattress is only 9 inches deep and it fits fine . 
there is nothing sticky about this pad . the top part is very much like a thick , quilted comforter . the edges are a stretchy cloth material . i almost want to call it mesh , but stronger than that . i do n't feel like i am going to tear it when i fit it around my mattress . 
i do n't think this company is associated with sealy . at least none of the descriptions or paperwork mentioned sealy . i love the topper though ! 
no , not really ... it needs to be fitted to the mattress ... it is amazing . 
the skirt on the king size is quite generous . i would check with the manufacturer . i do think they will be very honest with you about it fitting . i do know i love the fact that this pad topper does not shift around . i found that to be a real issue with other ones i have bought . they bunch up under you and it makes for very uncomfortable sleeping . this one doe not do it.. 
we 'll i just put it on a few weeks ago but it appears to be solid material that wo n't rip easily . 
the backing material is thick and patterned ... i myself am completely satisfied with this product ... sandi c 
not sure if it 's entirely possible to completely eliminate some shift but i 've found that to ensure a tighter fit , i pile on more than one mattress pad . i got this idea from a 5-star hotel that had the most amazingly comfortable bed i 'd ever slept on ... i took the bedding away to find that they had three pads on the bed . once i tried that at home , i was hooked and my pads do not shift . good luck on that . 
my mattress is 14 '' deep and it work fine . 
totally fitted and with ample fabric for my 18 '' , memory foam topped king . have to add this product is probably the best one i have bought to date . surp assed the quality of my previous ralph lauren and ck . a great buy ! 
it 's not very heavy , maybe 6-8 lbs . 
i do n't know for sure , but it was light . i am 69 had no trouble lifting it and placing it on my bed . 
i doubt this would work very well on a water bed mattress , however you could ask the company who is very easy to work with 
i do n't think it 's going to cool it down . it 's more likely to keep warmth in . it 's about an 1 to 1.5 inch thick . 
the pockets are probably close to 30 inches . i have a 22 inch mattress and it fits that with room to spare . 
i have a double pillow top queen mattress and the queen size mattress top fit great . not sure how deep your mattress is or if tou will need the 3 '' foam with this pad , i would recommend getting the full size for a full size mattress though 
then this is not what you want but if you are to add 3-4 '' mattress topper this topper had the depth to cover it . i also need a 3-4 '' topper and am happy i have this already to use to put on top of it . i like it . 
it has seams that ( at least so far ) keep the stuffing in place 
we use this in a motorhome with a mattress 5 inches shorter and do n't have this issue . i love this mattress pad , and we 've bought every type of mattress topper there is . 
i returned the ones i ordered . they were downright scratchy . 
i use the pad on a single bed . i do use deep pocket sheets because i have a fairly deep mattress and also have another lighter pad under the extra plush one . but the skirt on the plush one fits up to a 9 '' -18 '' deep mattress and provides an ample fit . unless your mattress is extremely deep i would think that regular sheets would probably work . 
as you can see from the photo it is quilted , but i feel it is very , very comfortable and feels like you are sleeping in a very nice hotel bed . i love it and to us it was worth every penny . 
for us it worked great . we actually think it does not store heat at all . 
i have never seen anyone dry clean bedding . if your front loading washer is large enough , just use that . 
maybe 3 8 's of an inch ... it 's not like any foam bad , it 's just a fluffy quilt . 
i would say approximately two and a half . i really love this mattress pad and i am so pleased with it . i definitely recommend this item . hope this helps . 
no ! 
i think cooler than just the mattress or a regular pad , but i ca n't say as it actually `` cools '' you . 
my bed had the same problem , and the mattress pad has helped considerably . it wo n't make your mattress like new , but it will give you a lot more padding and buy you some time before you have to replace your mattress . 
it 's kind of a thin stretchy fabric , but it 's very durable and it fits well and stays on the bed well . the whole thing is well made and durable , it 's just not real thick and plush . it 's basically a mattress cover . 
surprisingly no . i 'm a warm sleeper and i have n't notice any bed temperature differences since adding the topper . 
hi spanky it sure is . you 'll have no problem with the dimensions . thanks ! 
yes . was n't an issue for me . washed great . 
a traditional queen mattress measures 60 '' wide by 80 '' long . an olympic queen is 66 '' wide by 80 '' long . the mattress pad we bought ( and the one referred to here is the 60 x 80 inch ) . i have been in the bedding business since 1975 when the main-stream models were twin ( 39x75 ) , full ( 54x75 ) , queen ( 60x80 ) west coast queen ( 60x84 ) , king ( 76x80 ) , and california king ( 72x84 ) . you should note that these are united states ' sizes and that there are 6 international bedding standards : n. america , australia , uk & ireland , new zealand [ 5 ] continental europe & latin america , and japan . somoe of the bedding sizes within these standards are slithgly different in size and some are substantially diferent . now that there are several `` micro '' bedding companies ( similar to micro-breweries ) , there are a plethora of different sizes . if you want to buy reasonably priced bed clothes , then going outside of the 'norm ' will , no doubt , not only cost you , but it will limit your choices . the mattress pad we bought are conventional size and make a remarkable difference in the conventional queen size bedding we have . we have chosen to stay with conventional sizes as we have a bed and breakfast and with more than one bed , having a 'standard ' size to each room is cost-effective . i hope this helps you . 
no , it 's just a mattress cover itself , it 's one piece . 
it is pretty thick when you take it out of the package . a couple inches i feel , but i feel it went flat pretty quickly . i weigh 175lbs . and have a couple 8 - 11 lb . yorkies that sleep with me . it was okay , but i was looking for more plush than this . i think it is good , but just was looking for more . 
the fitted skirt is elastic and can fit to nearly any mattress , but does n't work like a bedskirt . it is meant to attach the pad to the mattress to keep it in place . if your mattress and box spring are not too thick , it could fit to both . 
i am not sure what a sleep number bed is but my husband and i sleep on a sofa bed and are so very pleased we bought the extra plush mattress pad it has made our bed very comfortable indeed . we can recommend it . 
hi ! all of our mattress toppers and sheets fit up to an 18 ' inch mattress ! if you have any other questions or concerns please feel free to ask ! -eluxurysupply customer service 
yes in fact , i think it does . i do n't wake up hot like i used to before i got the mattress . 
i 'm not sure if it is egyptian cotton or not . it 's super soft and great quality . both the top and bottom of the pad are made of the same material . 
yes ! it 's thick enough to cushion hip bones and not feel the mattress beneath but it is n't any more difficult to sit up . i bought this a month ago and still am loving it , no buyers remorse whatsoever . 
we 've had ours for 2 months & it 's just as great as the day we bought it . 
more fluffy . i bought it to put on top of a memory foam mattress because i was going from a 30 year waterbed bed to a 'real ' bed and i could not adjust to the firmness of the softest memory foam mattress . it added the 'fluffy ' i needed . 
hello , our mattress toppers are not treated with any flame retardant chemicals . thanks for inquiring about our products ! john eluxurysupply customer service 
the manual has cleaning instructions using white vinegar but too many steps for this venue . suggest you either go to the manufacture 's web site or call them for detailed instructions . it 's a simple process just too much to type here . 
if you purchase ground coffee ( as i do ) there will be some sediment in the bottom of the carafe . you can go to http : icoffee.com component hikashop product listing ? itemid=108 and order a basket filter at no charge if your coffeemaker did n't come with one . remington must have realized this issue and designed a fix . i use the basket filter and it works well at removing the sediment . 
dear kaye , fresh , medium coarse to coarsely ground coffee is recommended for best results . diane customer care 
all except the container pot and warming plate . ca n't say about internals . this is made the same as most any wal mart target brand ( it has the remington brand name on the base ) only it has the swirl function . the strainer filter is metal but not big whoop there . again , if want to save yourself a $ 100.00 go but a upscale mr. coffee and forget all the hype around icoffee . 
sorry , our clock is working just fine . have not had to reset it since we set up the machine . 
1 ) be sure to use coarsely ground coffee - either grind it yourself or in the store but it must be coarse - not the relatively find grind in pre ground coffee in tins 2 ) i suspect you can find a manual online ( it is quite brief ) if you can not find it i will scan and pdf the 3 important pages and send them 
yes it does . after 2 hours 
yes , i usually make only 2-4 cups . i just had to learn to adjust the amount of course ground coffee instead of finely ground . 
yes ... when not brewing , press the `` minutes music '' button..second touch should see on off selection ... 
i only make a six-cup pot of coffee , and timed the process this morning with my thermopen kitchen timer . from the time i pushed the start button ( mozart song plays the first time ) until the mozart song played the second time ( signaling the brew process is complete ) was 7 minutes , 54 seconds . i then let the pot sit another 3 minutes before pouring my first cup so most of the coffee can drain out of the secondary filter that is clipped into the pot , or carafe . i always take the secondary filter out of the carafe , or pot before pouring a cup of coffee . the filter will have some , not much , coffee remaining in it . i can not say how long for a full pot , or 12 cup pot of coffee . hopes this helps . 
i bought two of these mirrors and i love them . the light aspect is very subtle and atmospheric and you can certainly see in the mirror when light but i still have recessed lighting in my ceiling 
hi , thank you for contacting us . yes , you can install the mirror either portrait or landscape . have a great day . regards , howard - lighted image . 
yes there is a built in defogger but we have yet to see it in action so ca n't say how effective it is . 
hi , thank you for contacting us . yes , when the leds are off the frosted dots are visible . have a great day . regards , howard - lighted image . 
must be hard wired to a switch . 
hi , thank you for contacting us . unfortunately we do n't currently ship to canada due to the high shipping costs . recent estimates price shipping our mirrors to canada at anywhere from $ 200 to $ 350 per mirror . 
hi , unfortunately this does not have a cabinet option . 
hi , the depth of the mirror with the steel base is 1 '' . 
hi , the color temperature of these led 's is 6000k . i hope this helps . 
hi , this mirror is n't designed to shut off automatically . to turn the mirror off you would use the on off sensor switch that is located on the right side of the mirror towards the bottom . regards , howard - lighted image . 
hi , this mirror is 41.8 watts . thanks , howard - lighted image 
hi , yes you can hang this mirror sideways . 
hi , this mirrors and the other mirrors in our range are surface mounted to the wall . thanks , howard - lighted image . 
i do n't knos the lumens output but i certainly believe this would work well in that function . the light is bright and certainly is revealing . it will not light an entire room but i think it will complement the ceiling light well 
yes - however - the switch to turn it on is located on the right side of the mirror towards to bottom . so if you rotate it 90 degrees just make sure you recognize the on switch would now be at the bottom of the unit on the left side . 
it has to be recessed some because of the electric housing - it could n't be recessed all the way flush with the wall though . 
needs to be wired to buildings commercial power , just like an overhead or permanent light fixture 
without going home and measuring it i 'm guessing about 17 x 25 . 
hi , thank you for contacting us . unfortunately we only do our mirrors in 6000k ; sorry about that . have a great day . regards , howard - lighted image . 
hi , thank you for contacting us . i 'm not sure how you would be able to mount a medicine cabinet to the back of this mirror . there is a picture which shows the back of the mirror on the product page for this led mirror . just click the product photos which will open all photos and you should see it there . have a great night . regards , howard - lighted image . 
cool 
should be . the led version is hard wired as the on off is a motion switch . 
i do n't have anything to measure that exactly but if seems like it about medium-firm in density for both layers . but the top memory foam layer seems like it might be softer than the base layer . when on my side with my elbow straight down pointing into the mattress the ild seems is minimal compared to any spring mattress or couch cushion . 
we already had the box spring from our other mattress . since the measurements were the same , it fit perfectly ! hope that helps ! enjoy ! 
hello ! i 'm not sure if its necessary or not but i did wait and i still love the mattress . i have it in my houseboat so waiting was n't an issue . i guess it 's better to be safe than sorry . 
i think this mattress is way too mushy ( and i 'm a lightweight ) 
i do n't know why they sent this to me . i am a customer who bought this bed , not the manufacturer but since they did , i loved loved loved this mattress when it first came . i am still please with it but i do notice it tends to squish down in the places you sit , or lay on it most . i turn it a lot so it will stay in shape . if i was making a decision about this , i would not put it in a wall bed . just sayin ' 
warranty book inside packaging . 
i doubt that it will fold up easily in a futon . it will work as a bed - but it 's really thick and would be nearly impossible to fold . i think the same company makes a thinner mattress though - that might work . 
i got it within a week 
i have no idea about the centipur-us certified but the total of the mattress was 10 '' when fully deflated ( within an hour of opening packaging ) . 
if by `` components '' you mean the bed frame and box ( and possibly all the bedding and pillows ) , we 're reusing the old sleep number bed , and i seriously doubt those pieces are american-made ... it be nice to be able to buy all-american ... 
standard . they would could go in a regular muffin pan but instructions say you can put on a cookie sheet and cook that way . 
made in china 
well i have a mini muffin pan and these would n't fit in that . using a box mix specifically to make 12 cupcakes it came out perfectly so they are regular sized just slightly smaller the the pans would be which is how any of the paper cups would have also been . i have pictures on my blog of them in a full sized muffin pan reviewstuffz.blogspot.com 
sometimes that happens when there is n't enough egg or if they are n't cooled completely . another trick is to spray them with pam so nothing sticks to the inside . makes them easier to clean . 
hand wash 
little gems are now guaranteed to pass the twist test . however , our silicone products have always been independently tested to ensure they meet fda recommendations . kind regards , mike law sunsella 
it is in a holiday trailer , essentially resting on a 3 4 inch plywood platform . we have a very expensive memory foam mattress at home , i now prefer sleeping in the holiday trailer , it is a more comfortable mattress . 
waterbeds are 3-4 '' longer than a standard queenbed waterbed 84 '' x 60 '' standard queen is 80 '' x 60 '' the mattress is good , i got it for a guest room . 
i have not had a problem with it being hot . i have to keep my bedroom at around 65 or less because i just get so hot at night . this mattress does not seem to be hot and i have been sleeping really well on it . i find it nice and firm but not hard and the edges are n't to soft . i was thinking that if it did seem too warm i was going to get the gel topper for it but do n't think it is needed . 
i did n't wait that long and it 's been fine . 
we had to pick our parcel up at our postal box and it fit on the back seat of our half ton truck . we did have to push a bit harder to close the door though . the exact dimensions i do not have . we loved the mattress though and are happy we bought it . 
this mattress should not be flipped since the memory foam comfort layer is on top and the support base is on bottom . however , this mattress should be rotated 180 degrees every few months . 
i would say it 's a medium firm . this website was extremely helpful when trying to figure out how to chose the memory foam based on sleeping side , body type , and so forth . http : www.themattressunderground.com 
there is nothing you can do to get the foam to expand . if it is n't fully expanding it is because the foam was n't properly made or they cut off an end piece that should have been discarded . contact the shipper at 1-888-599-4352 to discuss options . they seem to be very willing to correct the problem . 
it 's pretty firm - but it 's memory foam - so you sink in a little . i really like mine , and i generally like a firmer mattress . 
yes , in california . the foam is much safer and virtually odor free because it is made right here . i love my brentwood , highly recommend . 
yes , these mugs are lacquered which seems to resist tarnishing therefore maintaining a shiny finish longer than other moscow mule mugs i have seen . 
it appears to me that just the exterior is lacquer . the interior is a bit less shiney . 
it 's been a year ... but i believe they are more basic stainless type handles , spot welded . this is good - the cups stay very perfectly cold , the handles are comfortable 
do n't know ... no manufacturing text on the mugs anywhere 
i do n't think so ; but not sure . i would not put on slats ; just put a piece of plywood on top the slats & it will be fine . mine is on a piece of plywood ; bottom of waterbed frame . no problem . you 'll love it ! 
yes 
the zipper is located on the underside of the mattress . it unzips around one end . it is very , very soft & plush . i was awed with it ; it 's so nice . 
i bought the mattress . i went to the makers site and read allthe specs there . it is very informative . go there and find your answer . 
for me it 's perfect . i guess i would consider it on the firm side of medium . 
as a previous writer wrote that this is an extremely soft mattress , i would'nt say that . i say it is medium firm . i got it for my son and he says it is not soft enough . i would say 350lbs . is no problem for this mattress . it is made pretty good , so i think it will last . i say go for it , you wo n't be disappointed . 
what zipper ? 
i use a frame 
i feel that it 's medium only i love it , hope that helps 
we had no issues with any scent . it did take a few days to fully expand at the corners , but we 're very happy with it , especially for the price . it 's a guest bed for us and so far it 's been received very well . 
hi tina i apologize for the delay below is your answer : we use a premium fabric made with fire retardant inherent fibers . the fabric is woven with fiber glass fibers that are inherently fire resistant . no chemical is used to process the fabric . please advise with any other questions or concerns . 
77x38x10 
thanks for your question ! this mattress is made from 3 layers of high density memory foam . there is a 5 inch layer of high density therapeutic foam , a 2.5 inch support layer of high density memory foam and the top layer is a 2.5 inch layer of gel infused memory foam . unfortunately i do n't have the exact density of each layer but 'high density ' would mean 6 pounds per cubic foot or higher . i hope this helps ! 
not firm at all , i had a water bed , which the bed is a lot firmer than and warmer . but not waking up with lower back problems . it 's definitely not a firm mattress , i can not sleep on a firm mattress . to me , its closer to a pillow top and with the 2 '' highloft gel matress topper ordered from overstock . it sleeps well ! 
if you mean piping no not at all 
i do not know the density , but i can tell you that this mattress is not firm . the body sinks in the mattress , and turning can be a challenge . i bought this item for my mother , she was uncomfortable to get in and out of the bed , and i had to return the mattress . 
ours was inflated within less than 24 hrs . i bought the same mattress for my son and his wife for christmas because they liked ours so much that we bought for the spare room and he said it inflated within less than 24 hrs and they love it . 
i do n't and it 's very comfortable . 
weighing 190 i notice no memory of where i lay . it 's new every night 3 months in . 
that is precisely what they ment they just have no clue how to word it . just head to toe and vice versa . 
john , i cant speak to the difference , aside from the obvious , 9 '' is thinner than 11 '' , but i can tell you imho , that the 10 '' is simply amazing . possibly the nicest mattress i have ever purchased really . 
what exactly is a gas out odor ? 
no , it is a gel infused product , mean it is mixed with the memory foam.i highly doubt there 's any danger of that happening . then it would be listed as an explosive.haha . no worries . 
it is a 5.5 lb . per inch memory foam with a top layer gel infused which probably , in my opinion , equates to about a 6.5 - 7 lb . per square inch . you do not sink into it yet it ver comfortable because you have no pressure points . the bamboo covering is very soft & very nice . we put a quilted mattress cover on top of it to protect it . i highly recommend this matters us it has a 25 year warranty . thanks for asking . 
`` eastern king '' is the same as just `` king '' size . 76 '' x 80 '' you can find it at this link http : www.amazon.com gp product b00f7s6fya 
the dimension of this product are the following : twin : 38-inches x 75-inches x 10-inches twin xl : 38-inches x 80-inchces x 10-inches full : 54-inches x 75-inches x 10-inches full xl : 54-inches x 80-inches x 10-inches short queen : 60-inches x 75-inches x 10-inches queen : 60-inches x 80-inches x 10-inches olympic queen : 66-inches x 80-inches x 10-inches king : 76-inches x 80-inches x 10-inches california king : 72-inches x 84-inches x 10-inches 
medium to firm . you tell there 's a lot of support but the top layer is nice and soft . i like a firmer bed , my husband likes a softer bed but we both sleep great on it ! 
medium firm 
the gel-infused foam feels different from regular memory foam . i do n't sink in like i did on standard memory foam , so i do n't have a problem changing positions at all . 
no it is a primary mattress and it is awesome . 
within the first three hours it looks like a mattress but i waited twenty four hours before sleeping on it and at that time it was fully expanded.i have been quite pleased with the mattress so far.six months of use 
no mine had a packaged date on it of three months prior to my purchase and it sat in my garage for five weeks before i brought it in . so no problem here . 
yes you can ... i bought one a raised metal frame for mine ... that would work fine 
i 'm sure it would be fine directly on the floor . 
the mattress does not need side support . we have two of these mattresses set on platform beds and have had no problem . hope that helps . 
i do n't know the density in numbers but it is a very firm bed . i doubt that it would work well with adjustable beds . it works well on a solid frame but would n't work with a box spring . 
there is no coating . it is high polished surgical stainless steel quality . other presses with coatings and plastic parts are difficult to keep clean because of the lemon oils that tend to build up on them easily . this press is by far the best i 've owned . very efficient press and very easy to keep clean . i 've had no problem with oil build up . i use mine daily . 
it 's 9 inches from tip to tip , the bowl is about 3 inches , the handles about 5 inches , with about one inch for the hinge . 
the inside diameter of the bowl part is 2 inches 7 8. just a little bit under 3 inches . 
none at all ! 
only small ones . 
china 
one of the best things i 've bought for the kitchen , love it ... 
the juice press is sturdy and i ca n't imagine the handles bending unless someone attempts to juice the lemon lime whole versus cutting it in half first . 
yes it is , works great ! 
do n't know . not stamped on juicer 
yes . you attach the `` leash '' just in case . you will find it difficult to lean or the window and get it going though . best if you can be outside . 
yes it does ... it is a limited warranty for one year ... it comes with the instruction manual page 18 you can contact their customer service rep at 1 888 966-0895 for more details hope it 's helps ... it is a great product ... so far i 'm very happy : ) 
yes , and it works on triple panes also . i have several large windows ( 7x9 ft ) and many large sliding doors . small windows ( 2x3 ft ) i do by hand . 
110 and 220 
no , it will only work on square and rectangle shaped windows that have a frame . it wo n't work on rounded glass . 
winbot w710 is designed for framed windows and mirrors , while winbot w730 works on framed and or frameless windows and mirrors . 
winbot uses a motor to generate suction , that is how it stays on the window . if you use winbot on a window above ground level , a safety pod is provided for extra protection . 
i was n't sure about that either - the windows i was purchasing the item for had frames so went with that . however , the question that no one answered for me was whether it had to have electrical cord . i had to return it when i found the cord was required - since the windows i had hoped to use it on are quite large and the thought of a heavy cord dragging around over everything beneath just would not have worked . great idea - just waiting for battery-powered version . 
not sure 
no . it seems a widemouth lid should fit but the jar top seems to be slightly smaller . 
never put them in a dishwasher 
no idea . but it 's 16 oz with a double wall so ice cold water never seaps through . the handle does n't allow it to go in a cup holder . 
i would think screen printing . the ink would probably scratch off . i put vinyl stickers on mine and they work awesome ! 
i do n't think so . the jar comes with kids 
just one . i bought 2 but each was separate . i love them ! 
no not the same kind , the ones at dollar tree are not double walled . 
plastic 
yes , you 'll love these stools ... you wo n't have to move them at all once you position the stools.. the base is wide and very comfortable so you can swivel and get out with ease . 
the lowest is 22 inch height and highest is 32. this chair is adjustable . just make sure when you assemble to remove the cap when attaching the base to chair . it will say in instructions provided . hope this helps . all my visitors love this chair . 
yes if you have a high counter top.. 
interestingly enough , i believe i have the same issue . my chair arrived and , after some close examination , i realize that the mechanism inside the hydraulic lift was missing . this may sound silly but , considering that the chair was the perfect time for my counter , i just let it be . i believe there is something salty with the chairs . 
about 19 inches wide 
it is a most likely missing technique ... it took my husband a few tries to get it as well . ours work now - hard to explain tho how to get it . 
definitely not . they are designed to keep you seated upright , not for lounging . it 
they are great 
you just lift it off . 
the diameter of the base is 17 1 2 '' 
hi jeetendra ! i bought three of them for my kitchen bar . everybody loves them , they are way comfortable , thick padding and very stylish . i had the bottom circle base powder coated nap black to match the chair cushion , wow was that a home run : ) very very saticefied . jeff w. in ohio 
23 inches or 1'11 almost two . cheers ! yes , i 'm a dork and did use a measuring tape . haha ! 
apparently there are 2 height sizes of bar stool . i do n't know the height but it is adjustable and fits the lowest height of counter bar . 
a person with about a 42 '' hip measurement could sit comfortably . the sitting space between the arms is about 17 '' 
250lbs or less 
yes ca117 fire retardant foam , shipping by tuesday no 
24 '' to 33 '' 
26 to 35 '' 
remove the red plastic cap on the top of the pedestal , per the directions . 
no , it is made from a vinyl but it really is a great fake ! and very good job on the upholstery work . 
it 's adjustable . i have mine on the shortest height , and it 's perfect for my countertop . i do n't have a tape measure , or i 'd be more specific . 
250lbs or less 
when connecting the chair , be sure to remove the black plastic cap that is on one of the chair peices . it looks like it belongs but doesnt . if not removed , the chair wo n't adjust 
yes , it has a start stop button . just press stop to pause and then start again when you want to resume the count up . then use the -- clear -- button when you want to clear the functions . this is a wonderful little clock . 
every time i press any button it makes a noise . no big deal to me . i love this timer . i can set it down on my counter top when i cook , and have it handy , rather than running over to my magnet timer on the fridge . ( large kitchen ) 
had item , and the timer still worked after 30 , plus years . however , the padded buttons started losing easy-to-connect setting feature . the timer itself , could have worked another 30 years . but , sent it out with the trash last month , after replacement was received and broke-in . i can still see it with my eyes closed . the base is about 3.5-inches square with viewing-slant running from about 1.75-inches in the back to 0.75-inches in the front . amazon product info shows weight at 2.4-ounces . i 'd say that is correct , with the one-aa battery . 
for me the viewing angle is poor . i would see it better if either i was a lot taller ( i am 5'1 '' ) or the angle was closer to vetical . if you are tall you should be fine with this timer . if you are short i would recommend finding another one . 
yes , there is an audible alarm . if you set it for 2 minutes the clock will start a countdown when you press the start stop button . after it countdowns the 2 minutes the alarm goes off and then the clock starts a -- count up -- -timer . this is neat because if you want to know exactly how long it was in case you walked away from it the countup timer would let you know your two minutes plus whatever else to add to it . it -- will not -- continue to repeat your two minute setting without resetting the alarm . 
yes . set your three hours , then touch memory , then start stop . when the timer goes off , touch start stop and take care of your father . then touch memory again , which will recall your first setting . touch start stop to start the next 3-hour cycle . to clear the memory , touch that key and hit clear . it would probably be easier , however , just to reset the 3 hours each time . this assumes you will be there to assist your father in taking his meds or that he is capable of following these directions himself . if you merely wanted to have the timer sound each 3 hours without just by hitting stop and start , it would not work . 
it takes a single aa battery . one is included . 
either works 
i just checked . the hour numbers go to 24 hours . the minutes numbers go to 60. so you could get 25 hours total . 
no , that 's one of the really great features about this model . 
even on high speed the water vapors last twice as long . also , the `` cup '' for the medicated vapor solution is multiple times bigger and not as awkward ( it actually is more like a cup than the strange odd shaped reservoir on the previous model ) . i replaced both of my vaporizers with the new ones and have been extremely pleased 
the old version had a small opening to refill the water . water would spill over as i tried to refill it . the improved version has a 3-4x larger opening to fill water . this is convenient as you can use your tub spout without having water spilled over . the second biggest improvement is the heating element . in the old version , the heating element had the caked on calcium deposits and i had to soak it with vinegar for a day or so . after using an old toothbrush to brush it off , the element deposits was not 100 % removed . for the new version , the calcium does get caked on , but i can pretty much remove 100 % of the deposits after soaking it in vinegar . other than that , the two versions are the same . i 'm inclined to buy another new version to replace the old one . one is used for an upstairs room and the other one for the downstairs room . 
you can barely hear it . when it needs to be cleaned it gets louder . a little vinegar , and it 's quiet again . my daughter sleeps with it going , she 's very light sleeper . 
no night light - just a small red light when it 's out of water and a green light when it is on . 
it shuts off when there is no more water . 
warm only 
you lift out the water reservoir and flip it over and fill it .. very easy to do because it is light and has a handle . 
it has a one gallon storage tank , but can turn two gallons of water to steam in a 24 hour period ( will run through 1 gallon every 12 hours on high ) 
i think so , for a while i put vicks on the swab and made my own method of menthol . it really most about having moisture in the air . hope that helps . 
no , you need clean it , but you do that when you take the blue water container off to fill and clean the top of the stand and where you fill the water . we use filtered water so only have to clean every couple of weeks , but the booklet says every week . hope this helps . 
the instructions do not say you have to use distilled water , relying on their filter to keep out mineral build up , but clearly using distilled water would work better and you do not have to replace the filter at some point . 
the attached series of videos will help you for all aspects of caring for your humidifier . http : edu.burgayocoffee.com search.php ? id=vicks+v4600+humidifier 
this model does not use filters 
no 
yes , unless you have a very large hand , i do exactly that from time to time . however if you use distilled water as we do , it seldom needs to be wiped out . we are very pleased with our unit , we use it most of the time and find it to be effective and inexpensive to use . i definitely recommend this product ... all pro 's and no con 's 
there are a lot of corners to clean . i was surprised just how quickly it starts to get moldy so you really need to keep on top of it . 
at times i hear the adjustment to the level of water decreasing . other than that the humidifier is very quiet . that does n't mean that there is never any sound . i would suggest emptying the water cleaning it out and try again . however what you are hering may just be the water level adjustment as it runs . 
bobbyjo , the light is in the on off knob . when the humidifier is on , the light is on , when the unit is off , no light . the light however is not very bright and does not shine like the usual night light , however it would be very easy to cover the light on the knob with a small piece of adhesive tape so it would not shine at all . btw have had many humidifiers in the past and this is the very best of any of our previous units . also , if you use distilled water , it will not produce 'white dust ' on your furniture and if you put a very slight amount of vaseline on the fill cap seal it will stop any leaking and make it easy to remove the cap . 
they do include one or two aroma packets although you do n't have to use them . 
the table can have the height adjusted up to 6 different settings . the tabletop can tilt down one notch , and tilt up one notch for reverse use as an easel . 
18 inches between legs . 
15 x 20 
this table can be adjusted up to 29 1 2 inches tall . it will be more unstable at that height though . mine came with 3 different angles for the tray , and not any of those were level enough to use as a snack tray . i had to drill a couple of holes down from where the tray support rod connects to the legs , about one inch from the existing holes , from center to center , that made it level enough to use as a snack tray . it 's still a little wobbly , but most snack trays are that way . 
i never use it , but i measured it and it is as follows : a rectangular pull out of 4 3 4 inches by 3 1 2 inches on the right side , with a hole of 3 inches in diameter , which contains a 1 inch deep cup of 2 3 4 inches in diameter . the cup fits easily into the hole in the pull out shelf or you can push it down further to make the opening about 2 inches deep . i have n't tried it , but it seems a little risky for heavy containers and or beverages . like i said , i never use it . 
unfortunately not , the table can only raise up to 28 inches high . 
hard to answer without knowing the height of the bed and how you would use in said bed . i use it in my living room directly in front of my easy chair sliding it back over my legs to eat or use a laptop or whatever . i had to adjust the legs to reach just the height that i felt comfortable for its use . it slides easily on my floor so no problem with that , but all these things are variables depending on your own location and use . i can say that if you are looking for the sturdy long type of hospital table that wheels over a bed for that type of use , this is not it . this one is smallish and less sturdy but my apt . is small and for me this does the trick . i do n't think it would serve well as over the bed type table . better off looking for the more substantial hospital type wheeled table . 
yes , the table can fold up to lay flat with collapsible legs that you swivel inwards and lay flat . it is about 3-4 inches thick when folded flat for storage . 
table top measures 20 '' x 15 1 2 '' 
yes , the highest height setting is ~ 28.5 inches 
i 'm sorry , i 've only used it for ice cold beverages . 
yes . i use mine for smoothies a lot ... even for milk shake consistency . the straw is wide enough and , if needed , you can remove the straw and shake up the smoothie to redistribute the ingredients ( in the event that you did n't drink it right away ) . 
i have the 20 oz cup . its 3 inches across the bottom . thats slightly bigger than a soda can . fits in all my cup holders . i dont have a stroller to try though . best cup there is ! ! ! 
yes , as a matter of fact , the spring loaded flap on the lid that closes when the straw is removed also keeps the straw from moving around on its own . i just shook an empty tumbler with the straw inside and the straw never moved or made a sound , even without any liquid in the glass . this is a great tumbler ! 
not really ; there is n't much for insulation . but they have a very functional straw and closing system . 
yes , this is 100 % bpa free . as are most contigo brand items . 
i just always put the straws & tumbler in the dishwasher ! i also do that very thing with all our toothbrushes ! blessings on your day ! 
yes . soda will not shoot out from this straw , as there is no negative pressure build up that occurs . 
no . it is not leak proof when the straw is in the lid . it is leak proof when the straw is not in the lid . the leak is a slow dribble , so if you knocked it over by accident it would n't leak very much . 
the 16 oz is 7 1 8 inches . i love them ! ! 
the 20 oz size i have will not fit under any single serve coffee brewer i have seen . mine stands 7.5 inches tall . 
plastic 
i have two of the 20oz tumbler and the straw is 10 11 '' long 
yes - i purchased a set of 8 extra straws ( they do break ) ... i purchased rainbow colored replacement acrylic straw set of 8 from california tools . came with a perfect sized straw cleaner . have used for over a year . would recommend . hope this helps 
yes . there is trap that covers the straw hole to secure it . 
yes 
depends on how thick the smoothie is . the straw is about the same as a regular drinking straw . 
yes , the straw is not water tight ( for obvious reasons ) , so it will leak both around the straw and through the straw itself . 
i have their metal containers for hot beverages . i would n't use it for hot beverages for 2 reasons : first , if they do n't melt the plastic , they would n't maintain their heat ; and second , you 'd probably burn your hand . i 'm sure they are meant solely for non-hot liquid . their metal containers keep liquids hot for more than an hour ! 
yes it does . 
yes this does work with rhe seal a meal . 
from the pictures i 've seen , it looks like this hose will fit . 
it should ? i have no trouble from mine . i did find that you really need to put a cap on the lid to insure the vacuum stays good . lee 
first of all , if you have a newer model , this wo n't work with yours . i have an older foodsaver that only vacuums , does n't seal , and it works on that . i took the plastic part off of the end of the tube that comes out of the machine , so there is only a long plain tube . you stick one of the ends of your attachment into the tube , ( outie to innie ) . i then use it with the vacuum sealing attachment for sealing canning jars . ( foodsaver t03-0006-02p regular-mouth jar sealer . ) i use it everyday ! i later bought one for my son & daughter-in-law along with the attachment tube . this model : foodsaver fsmssy0200 mealsaver compact vacuum-sealing system . they could not remove the green & clear part from the tube . it turned out , they did n't need it ! the clear part snaps off and the little stem that sticks out fits on the jar sealer . voila ! no need for the extended tube attachment . i also got the big foodsaver from costco that seals , vacuums , does accessories , etc . ( foodsaver v4840 two-in-one vacuum sealing system . ) the little stem on that also fits the jar sealer . no need for the additional tube . i hope this helps . if this does n't help , text me at 720-323-8657 and i 'll send you pics . i love my system of sealing food , -no more stale , wasted food ! 
i do n't think so 
yes . 
i do not know never used the deni 
so far it is working very well . the hand held to me is weaker but worlds well with mine 
i do not know about a rival seal a meal . i know it works well with the food saver . i use mine all the time . 
20 will not fit into one compartment . about 10 bags fit comfortably in one compartment ( by comfortable i mean you could take one bag out without others falling out ) . if you really pack them in and put half of them upside down , you can get around 16 in one compartment . 
my tea bags fit just right at just a smidge over 2 1 2 inches wide . i would guess that a tea bag ( in the wrapper i assume ) that is 2 3 4 could potentially fit snuggly and may need to fold a bit , thus fitting less bags in a drawer . the drawer measurements i have are : inside width 2 5 8 '' , inside depth 2 1 8 '' , and inside height 2 3 4 '' - with space above because they are expected to be taller than the height of the drawer . hope this helps ! 
it 's 2 pieces stuck together . it comes apart very slightly when i pull on both sides . so it looks like you could get them apart but you might break them trying . good luck ! 
yes 
the space for the holders is 3x3 . hope that helps . pam 
i think the dimension of the product are those shown on the website ... 10.8 x 5.1 x 8.6 inches 
i have mine on a flex steel recliner . the two grasps on the bottom of the couch tray expand to 9.5 inches . i hope that helps . 
it would probably depend on how wide the arms are . if they are like a dining room chair , probably not , but wider arms might work . 
the rim is 1 '' outside . i have used this tray with my mouse , but it 's only for couch potato activity on my part ; you may find it perfect . 
i washed mine in my kicthen sink , i just used some dawn 
yes the ring can be folded and the entire net is a nice tidy size that will easily fit into a suitcase or duffle bag . 
hi leeann , unfortunately we do not . thank you , 
hi carmen , this product will fit most bed sizes , twin , double , full size and at most a queen , but it might be stretching it . hope that helps . thanks , 
yes it does , i bought two of these and they are really good value . hope this helps . 
i bought a lingerie bag to put it in and put it in the washing machine , but have n't tried that yet . i would definitely contain it to keep it from getting tangled or snagged . lingerie bags are cheap enough , or use a cotton pillow case , secured with a rubber band . i have done that with delicate things as well , just to keep them from collecting lint or snagging and tangling in other items being washed . i do n't know that i would dry it in a dryer . probably hang it back up and let it air dry . 
you can if you can hang it high enough . it 's a lot of fabric but it could easily cover a crib and it definitely keeps out the bugs ! 
it 's like thumb tacks 
it 's not heavy . it comes with a anchor to put in the ceiling and hook that goes into that , from which the whole thing hangs . 
the circular ring at the top is completely enclosed and nothing can enter that way . the opening slit is generous enough to overlap sufficiently to prevent `` '' crawly '' '' entry . but ... bedbugs live in the mattress . good luck with that . 
hi michael , this is really meant for twin , full , and at most queen . hope that helps . 
buy one of those portable water filter and filter the water that way . then use that to pour into the humidifier tank 
hello adam , i run it with distilled water and do n't use a filter . no white dust . i 've seen some other comments that performance of filters depent on water treatment of local utilities . sometimes filter do n't work at all . 
no . the night light can be turned off , but the display panel is always on , and the blue leds are brighter than you might expect . i tried to tape some cardboard over it , but there 's still a glow and it interferes with the hygrometer . 
yes . ..depending on how long you leave t on 
plugs in no batteries . we are still very pleased with it . 
there 's no filter . depending on usage and water type , cleaning to remove scale may be required every other week to optimize performance . if you live in a hardwater area , its recommended to use distilled water . easy to clean comes with small cleaning brush . if scale becomes difficult to remove with brush you can clean with 1tsp of vinegar ( intruction in booklet ) i have been using our 2 units since dec. 24th and have no signs of scale . we use distilled water .hope this has been helpfull 
i am very unhappy with this unit . too late to return . 
this is a warranty question for the manufacturer . 
according to the manual , no you can not . 
i use this in my bedroom and living room 
this unit evaporates the condensation it creates i live in a tiny condo with only one slide sideways window , the humidity and heat is crazy . this unit is care free , very affordable , and easy on the electric bill 
it is loud , but not obnoxiously loud , just have to turn the t.v . volume up a little . there is a quiet mode but it 's not any quieter then the other modes . totally worth it though , it cools off our rooms quickly and very easy to move from room to room . 
yes , our windows is sideways , you need duck tape and thick card board to fill in the gap . 
no , and you do n't have to empty it . the water is vaporized and goes out the window . my unit is about 1 foot from the wall and about 2 feet from the window exit . i aim the blower at a wall opposite from me . works great ! 
i just purchased this unit about 2 months ago and i have n't had to empty it once ! i opened it up last night to check again and not 1 drop . i leave it on 67 almost all day long ! some runs have been over 24 hours and not a drop . i live in southern california and i have a friend with this unit in arizona and he said he has to empty his about once a month so it probably depends on the humidity . 
well it 's adjustable to fit almost any window . if it does n't you can cut the plastic down to 12 '' as long as you can fit the exhaust which is about 10 '' long by 3 '' high out the window . 
it expands to fit whatever width your window happens to be . it is not airtight , though . i put some foam to make it more so . hope this helps . 
the point in the hose is to close up the house from infiltration of heated outside air . the hose fits to the vinyl closer for either a door or window that allows that to happen . if you were to simply put the unit in front of a door and run it , it would be like leaving the door to your refrigerator open all the time - it would put some cold air into the fridge , but would be horribly inefficient . hope that answers your question . 
the footprint is the length multiplied by the width of the room you are trying to cool . if your footprint is less than 400 chances are this is a good size unit for you . 
yep . a small remote with all the functions . 
there embroidered the material . i love the bedspread and get many complants on it . 
yes 
yes its 58 the price without shipping.. thank you 
its microfiber ... 
this quilted bedspread has a very light ivory background ... .definitely not white 
yes just order this and send me an email that you wany the king size.. 
there are like a light mauve , a really nice color , and an off white . however , the sides come up short , so i have added a bed skirt . the set is really very pretty . 
yes exactly these tow comes with th bedspread 
it comes with the tow pillow cases showing on the picture 
yes , it can . i have very thick carpeting in my living room and neato works like a charm on it ! 
the previous answer is likely not the cause . these are typically shipped with the battery switch in the off position . simply remove the dust bin and look inside the well on the side . you will see the battery switch . if it is off , then turning to on will resolve your problem . 
i 've got 2 of these . one for the 1st floor and one for the 2nd ( yeah , i know - i 'm too lazy to carry the thing up and down the stairs ) . i have hardwood floors throughout and 9 different area throw rugs scattered about . have n't had any significant issues . though if the rug has long tassels , i could see them potentially getting tangled in the brush . another potential issue is if the rug is unusually deep ( like a heavy shag ) , it might have some trouble making the transition from floor to rug . 
90 days 
no idea if it 's updated , and it never occurred to me to check it or update it , but according to neato 's website , there a usb port on the vac that will connect to a computer , and neato 's pc application will update the vacuum 's software for you . i 'll try mine when i get home ! 
90 days refurbished . new ones are one year . 
1. if you bought through amazon , you have the standard amazon return policy . 2. for anything else contact the seller - - who will tell you to contact the company - - and that often the company is very good at replacing units that do n't work right . 3. after reading a lot of the comments i understand that the battery warranty is 60 days and the unit warranty is 90 days . 4. at any rate , it is still worth contacting the seller and the company . 5. my only real problem is that my unit is in chinese , and instructions are not intelligible . 
try to upgrade firmware with pc ? 
they appear to be brand new batteries . and the vac works great . i am a lazy bachelor , the carpet and tile is the only thing clean in my house , and thats because of the robot . now if i could figure out a way to get it to do the dishes . 
works great just as it does on hardwood floors . however , i do n't use it on terra cotta ( mexican ) tile floors because they are uneven , and i 'm concerned that the vibration will eventually damage the machine . just like all other floor areas , you may want to thoroughly vacuum occasionally to clean edges and corners or sweep them out prior to running the neato . after years of roombas , love , love , love neato ! 
i just measured mine and the cooking surface is 12x10 . the dimensions outside to outside including the handles is 16 x 10.5 
yes 
i will let it soak for an hour or so in a little dish liquid and water , then use a nylon or plastic scouring pad to lift any remaining hardened food . 
the attached tags did n't say , but it is magnetic . 
wooden stand and slicone handle is out of stock thanks . 
its only pan not cover or stand included 
do not buy them they are made cheap i all ready have rust in ny pan 
i dont know . but i dont recomend you to buy this product ! i bought it and from the very first time i used it the teflon started to fall , so dissapointed 
they 're very light weight , but you get what you pay for . they wo n't last 10 years . but they 're very basic . i 've only had mine for a month so it 's hard to judge how they 'll last . but they 're not heavy or anything . 
yes it is ! no worries , put it right in the dishwasher ! 
believe it ceramic they are also thin and not worth the money 
it has the symbol on the bottom that says you can . 
rings 
they are , but i would n't recommend it . washing them in the dishwasher wears down the coating faster . they are very easy to hand wash , stuck on food comes right off.. i love them ! 
i do n't know . seriously doubt that there be lead in them . check with mfg . 
8 '' frying pan , 10.5 '' frying pan , 5.5 '' sauce pan , 7 '' sauce pan , 8 '' sauce pan , & 10 '' chef 's pan w lids for all but the frying pans 
only certain foods in my case it was a portabella mushroom with balsamic vinegar left a small stain that has lighten over time not a real noticiable stain other than that this cookware is awesome . 4 1 2 stars 
it is very durable but i would still recommend it . 
yes they do . wear mitts . thr handles seem solid though . 
they are marked ptfe and pfoa free 
not sure where made probably china and we have not used the in the oven but i love cooking with them and they clean up really easily . i purchased a pan and then the whole set . 
it says made in china on mine ! 
yes , they are 100 % , bpa free & fda approved : ) 
it is the standard size cup which means it is the same size as most of the cups available and fits perfectly into the regular muffin pan if necessary , so the same size as the cupcake papers available . 
yes 
silicone 
to . me it is more of a sky blue 
i have several sets of these and although they are bpa free and 100 % food grade fda approved silicone there is no indication where they are made . i also checked their website and it does n't state there either . they do have a lifetime guarantee . 
my guess would be china , like everything else 
there is a lever next to the handle that seals the door . then on top there is a little black lever that you turn to pressure or non pressure . i can tell you that i 've been using mine for 4 months now and adore it . my fav is doing baked potatoes . i do n't like nuking them but wanted a faster way to do them than the oven . i do a full tray at one time . i wash the potatoes , then rub them with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt . bake at 410 for 35 to 45 minutes ( depending on how big they are ) and you will swear that they came from a high end eaterie . : o ) also have done pizza , bread , rotisserie chicken and more in it . i like that it does n't heat up my kitchen like my oven does and it actually does a much better job than my oven . the only cons i have about it are 1 ) i wish it were a bit bigger so i could put a big turkey in it 2 ) the gauges are in larger increments so it is more difficult to get an exact . for things that need a more exact time i 've started using a timer , just to be safe . would i recommend this product ? absolutely . i 'm going to buy one for my mom ! 
the wolfgang puck infomerical stated that the oven would cook frozen foods ; adjust time and temperature for that . 
had the same issue . i could live with that but not the interior cleaning issue . food results great but after about four or five meals interior was impossible to clean . started to set off my smoke alarms . decided to return it . 
no 
on my oven ( non-rotisserie ) the handle on the valve goes to the v. the valve handle points to you if you are in front of the oven . 
i think there might be a newer version but mine measures 12 1 2 '' high 16 '' deep ( including handle - base of machine is 13 1 2 '' not including handle ) , 19 3 4 '' wide . 
yep , junk , very dissatisfied . but if you want to take a chance on it , buy it here through amazon . that way you at least have a chance to return it and get your money back . the company that supports these is notorious for weak support . 
sensor touch . i use this often and have had no problems . 
increments : 465 f , 430 , 430 , 355 , 300 , 250 , 195 , 140. the salton induction cooker is essential to my kitchen . i use the higher temps to get water boiling and find that the 250f keeps eggs boiling at the right temp . also , 250 f is perfect for a simmer , saut . 
yes if you can if there is elect power avaible . 
the bottom panel says `` made in china '' . 
excellent for a college student ! ! almost impossible to do anything wrong ( almost ... you never know what college students may do ! & # 128540 ; ) it is induction , meaning it uses a magnet ( so the cookware must be magnetic like cast iron or stainless steel . aluminum and copper will not work ) to 'activate ' the element so the unit will not turn on and or turns off when the pot is removed . if the pot is removed while the unit is still powered on the unit will sound a rather loud beep tone until the pot pan is returned or the unit is powered off . also , if the unit begins to over-heat ... like with long cooking ( a good 'low and slow ' pot roast for instance ) it will beep and cycle off to cool , then beep and cycle back on . this can be a little disconcerting until you realize it is just a safety feature to protect the unit . once it is shut off , it does also have a cooling fan that will run for about a minute before it completely shuts off . just fyi for the safety too ... one of the greatest parts of induction cooking is that nothing outside of the pan gets hot . you can actually place a paper towel between the pan and the unit while it is cooking ( yes i have done this , to protect the glass top from being scratched by the rough bottom of a cast iron skillet ) without the paper burning . 
it has a temp display ; however what it shows is the temp that you have set it to . not a display of the pan or food temp . hope that helps you ! it is a great device . dave 
14 '' l x 11 '' wide . fits in cabinet nicely . i use it a lot ! 
you have to use special cookware up to 12 '' 
i have not had this problem . i would think that this is a manufacturers defect and that the product should be returned . 
internal circuit error . parts either have an open or short . contact service center for repair . 
hi jennifer the dimensions of the cube are 1 inch square . 
hi , yes they are bpa free , thanks . 
hi d. brush , the size of each cube is 1.06 '' height x 0.93 '' x 0.93 '' inches square , hope this is ok for you , thanks . 
the interior of the popper is stainless steel . the hood is plastic . the popped corn momentarily ricochets off the hood as it leaves the popper and goes into your bowl . i hope this helps . 
yes 
the hot air blows from vents on the sides , all the way around the unit . it works well , worth every $ . 
the t in the word t-fal means teflon 
do n't know for sure - it is either aluminum or stainless steel . 
you turn it off when all kernels are thru popping . it makes enough to serve 2 or 3 . 
turn it off when popcorn stops coming out . the top is solid black and gets very hot . 
i do n't have an answer for this question . you might have to do some research . 
okay . i 'm not an idiot . i did not call anyone a name i simply asked a question to a question to me . and since i have never , ever drunk a single drop of coffee , and never will , asking the question was a genuine curiosity . and frankly , i buy the right appliance for the right purpose . while i am creative , i would never have thought of anything coffee related . 
i have no idea ! we purchased it as a gift , to use as described-to pop , popcorn ! 
dear hector , thank you for your inquiry . it is recommended to lightly grease and dust with flour , as it will assist the product to release from the pan evenly . thank you for allowing me to assist you with your inquiry . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
dear lanai1 , thank you for your interest in the cake boss bakeware products . the material is carbon steel . with normal use and following the manufacture `` important use and care '' informational sheet that comes with the product , that should not be an issue you will encounter . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
dear ronald , thank you for your inquiry . i have provided the sizes you requested they are as follows : two 10-inch by 15-inch cookie pans with drop zones ; two 9-inch round cake pans ; 9-inch by 13-inch cake pan ; 12-cup muffin pan . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . tonia d. consumer relations 
dark nonstick pans typically cook at 25-50 degrees less , depending on altitude . also , be sure to not use cooking spray , as it will `` fry '' your cake and ruin your pans . 
literature provided with the bakeware set says handwash only . that being said , cleaning these pans by hand is so easy because nothing sticks to them ! 
i 'm not sure but the person i bought it for loves it and has had no problems . 
the diamonds are 1 2 inch across and 1 inch long and the big diamonds are 1 1 2 inches across and 2 1 4 long 
i did mine after it was on the cake . you just need to be careful with the alignment at the point where it meets . 
works better with fondant . 
answer here ... excelente 
yes is to big for cupcake 
i 'm pretty sure they would work well for clay . i love them for fondant texture ... ... which is similar to clay . 
i do n't believe it would but it work just find with fondant 
hi , below the specs : primary color : clear shipping weight ( in pounds ) : 0.2 product in inches ( l x w x h ) : 15.14 x 6.8 x 0.2 any further questions please let me know . best regards , diazbetterdeals 
i have had it for 14 months . i used it earlier this week . today , it does not work , will not turn on . checked all electronic connections , they were clean and tight . it is 2 months out-of-warranty , nearest panasonic svc center is over 250 miles away . even before this incident , i could not buy bags locally . had to special order them and it took forever to find a supplier , even tho i live in a major city . i was not happy with that , but `` hey , it is a great vacuum cleaner ! '' not any more . a vacuum of this price should last more than 14 months , especially when it is used once a week ! update , 2 20 15. used a local vacuum cleaner repair company . there is a circuit board in the on off switch . a rheostat burned up . i had them bypass that , which meant it would be only one speed , high . that 's okay . it works now . cost $ 69 . hate to see what a new circuit board would have cost . 
it has never fallen off . take it back to sears and complain . 
at full extension , the handle is 48 inches long , and when i hold it at the angle needed to actually vacuum , it still reaches about 33 inches off the floor . i 'm 5'8 '' and for me , the handle is comfy as low as 27 or 28 inches . it also can telescope down to a lower height . 
consumer reports rates the 937 10 points higher than the 917 , says difference is bare floor performance . 
do n't have a cat , but it does pick up dog hair very well , if that 's any help . 
yes 
my wife and i have had the vacuum for about four months and we use it nearly every day . the extended cord is about 8 feet in length and we have not had any problems . be careful rewinding the cord since the spring in the vacuum is `` vigorous '' and will snap the plug-end of the cord is you are not careful . 
the little swivel wheel in front feels like rubber . the two large rear wheels are plastic , but not really hard plastic . they have a little give to them . 
the power head swivels to about 20degrees to each side . you could not swivel it 90 degrees to go side to side . 
no , none . 
glad to assist : ) . the uv bulb is rated to last 10,000 hours . this can vary depending on amount of usage . the retail value of the uv bulb is $ 12.50 per unit . however , if a customer purchased the air purifier from us , then we sell them at a wholesale cost of one uv bulb at $ 4.50 plus $ 2.93 shipping via usps first class mail within the usa only . thank you : ) ! 
hi mary , each unit will purify 500 - 1,000 sq . ft. of space depending on existing air quality in your space . i hope this helps : ) . 
yes it does , for the smoke smell . obviously if you have something dank lying around you will still be able to smell that . 
very simple . unplug the unit first . 1 ) push the button near the top to access the filter . flip open the top of the unit . 2 ) to remove the filter unit pull up by the handle . 3 ) use a soft cloth , warm water and mild soap . do not submerse the filter in water or rinse directly in water . use the cloth to remove the dirt from the filter then rinse the cloth often to remove the debris and soap . repeat as needed ! 4 ) very important : only touch the filter by the handle and most of all the filter must be 100 % dry before you install it back into the unit . once the filter is dry slide back into the slot gently do not force it ! the filter will only fit one way . 5 ) close the top and snap it shut . plug in the unit and you 're good to go . hope this helps . 
no , in the instructions it says to clean every few weeks . it 's easy to remove , so you can just check if there is a dirt on it . 
hi stephen , yes , the blue night light has an on off switch . i hope this helps and thanks for looking : ) . o-ion 
it controls the light on the front . i 'd call it a night light switch . 
the first couple weeks i kept it on at all times . now i just had it on when we are sleeping or if allergens are high . the air remains fresh in the house . i also do not have to dust as often because it has cut down significantly . 
hi brigitta , yes , the purifier works for pet dander . however , please note that purifiers do not work like vacuum cleaners so it will not remove dander off all surfaces like a vacuum cleaner . purifiers can only filter the air that passes through the unit . i hope this helps : ) . 
i currently have one in my daughter 's room because of her allergies and my family room . both are pretty decent size rooms .

mounted like artwork . sticks out from wall . 
dimensions are listed under product details . 
heat blows from top front of unit ... so it blows front and out 
this unit does not need to be on its on dedicated outlet but here is the electrical guides : volts 120 amps 10.3 watts:1240 carlos 
you need to make sure the air slit is not wet at all.. if it has any moisture in it the steam wo n't come out of the top.. the slit is different than where the steam comes out of , its under the top and on a side . wipe it really well and assemble and try again . 
do n't buy it . does n't work after 1 month ! ! 
i have to do the same thing

the price was per piece . if you want seven , you 'll need to order seven . 
no 
they are pretty small . maybe 2-3 inches . but we 'll worth it ! 
there are no modes to change . it just switches between different colors . i would get a few , they are not that bright . 
about an inch and a half . comparably they are slightly larger than a golf ball . i recommend getting a few if you are looking for them to stand out for decorating . 
no , just one and they do change colors.i ordered one for my daughter and she loves it.the colors are very pretty , keep in mind it is plastic but it is cute . 
yes . there is an on off switch on the back . 
they will last through the night but only one ( or maybe two ) nights . the battery would quickly be extinguished and you would probably spend a lot on replacing the battery every other night . i also use a nightlight but i use a small light that plugs into the wall with a nightlight bulb in it . i also have one of these http : www.amazon.com ge-flower-design-incandescent-51386 dp b002dng9a2 ref=sr_1_18 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1410570644 & sr=8-18 & keywords=night+light which works really well . hope that helps ! these mushroom lights are still fun and are really good for a few hours a night ! 
ok dear , i will refund to you i just hope you can give me a favor to leave a positive feedback with all 5 stars after i refund to you , it is important for me is it ok ? if you agree , please tell me at the first time , i will refund to you in 24 hours . no ! ! 
what i have discovered is : cream that has been ultra pasteurized will take a long time and a great deal of shaking , also the cream should be at room temp ( about 72 degrees ) or it will again take a long time . this experience comes from using both the chef'n and the old fashioned churn with one gallon of cream . hope this helps . namaste , fran 
you have to keep shaking it , eventually the whipped cream will separate into butter and whey . 
correct , it is n't salted unless you add it . for a 1 cup of cream , yielding 1 4 cup butter , i mix in about 1 8 tsp of salt . the butter is very pliable when you 1st make it so you 'll have an opportunity to adjust the seasoning to taste . 
yes . i freeze butter all the time and my homemade stuff is no different . works great . 
i have no clue what cultured butter is . 
the product is made of plastic . i do not know of any stainless steel models . 
it goes on the bottom ( the side that screws into the ramekin ) of the main compartment . if you look closely , there 's a little gap the silicone band will fit in . 
its lighter and taste better , i 'm no scientists but i think it 's less i 'm not a butter person store bought taste bad to me , but the homemade taste awesome . 
i do n't know for sure but i do n't think so . to make butter using buttercup it is best to use the freshest butter you can get and make sure the temperature of the cream is at the room temperature . 
no , we bought our own jars to store the butter in . 
yes . the bottom is enameled as well and is smooth . so it should be fine on a glass top . i believe it 's fine for induction tops too . 
yes 
mine came as blue . didnt even realize description was different . 
i bought this item 2 years ago because it was being discontinued . i already had a smaller version of the dutch oven and ordered this model to replace it . i believe it was being discontinued to be replaced by the 1000 series . this is a quote from tramontina : `` new manufacturing techniques combined with improved materials and design have revitalized old world cooking traditions to offer superior product performance and versatility for an exceptional cooking experience . '' they may have made changes to the material used or the enamel bonding process . i 'm not sure exactly . the design of the 1000 series on their website looks like the sides may be less sloping than my model . i suppose you could email tramontina and ask what the changes are . i like my model and use it often . it has held up well . i do hand wash it as directed . 
i have n't try making bread in it but you are able to put in the oven with no problem . yes the handle is metal . we 've made a lot of delious meals in it , well worth it . 
dimensions : 15 x 13 x 9 inches ; 13.8 pounds 
maryann , made a stew that had some tomato in it but just a small amount . no staining from that . i baked a bread in it at 425 degrees and had some very faint browning in the enamel but not much . 
the knob is stainless steel and it is oven safe , up to 450 degrees . 
yes it is assembled in china 
not sure . we have n't tried it . 
hello gale , we have checked with the manufacture and confirmed it is made in china . 
generally it cuts a .4 x .4 '' x 2.75 '' fry with ease as long as youre cogniscent of the slicing footprint you 'll be a french fry furor cutting up several pounds of fries in under five minutes ... ... .meaning that for the quick meal your kitchen cred will climb several rungs with family and friends 
i am not to sure , but i do know this can cut unpeeled potatoes . i had a different style one that i had to actually cut potatoes in half and put cut side against the blades to get it to work . 
these pillows are all standard size from m'lily 
it is waffled and too hard and i do not like it . 
other products have evolved to include gel in them , this one only has memory foam in it however , at its low price , its a very good seller at my stores . 
mine is 24 '' x 15 '' but i 've used it . maybe it flattened out . i love the pillow and would buy one again . hope this helps . 
i sleep on my side and on my back . the pillow is ver comfortable for the most part but i wish it was bigger in general . i need more support under my neck and i feel it 's lacking in that . 
this was an exclusive . 
depends on your usage , of course . we go about 4 - 6 weeks . with 6 batteries per grinder , you might want to consider rechargeable batteries . 
yes 
6 x aaa batteries ( not included ) 
aprox 2 oz 
no they do not . we are returning ours after finding out the hard way . 
judging by the set i have owned for over 10 years , there is not a lot of tarnishing . the more you use it the more polishing that is required . i am not as happy with this new set as my original . the copper seems thinner which means if you over heat it , the copper will discolor . 
real copper . not just painted on . 
copper conducts heat more evenly . there are no hot spots on the inside of the pan . 
i 'd say they are about a quarter of an inch . they are incredibly sturdy and are heavy . we 've had ours almost a yet ... .best purchase ever . 
i do not know where they are manufactured , probably china . i have decided after using them for a few months that the stainless steel is not as good as some older pieces i have that were manufactured in the u & gt ; s & gt ; and show 18 10 on them or even 18 01. they are adequate , but they have turned some odd colors ( stainless steel ) from the heat . my older pieces never did . the copper seems to not be equal on all pieces either , turning a very light yellow on the small fry pan , while turning a brownish color on the other pans . even so , they do work pretty well and i like the fry pan quite a lot . hope this helps . 
it looks like it 's the dimensions of the box . the listed dimensions are not in any way similar to any of the pans . 
stainless steel 
you can get a copper cleaner . do n't use on the inside and make sure it is n't flammable . 
they are dishwasher safe ! though if you are wanting to make them non stick through seasoning its best to wash them by hand : ) 
made in china . 
i have this set off pans and a stand alone induction cook top separate from my electric cook top . these pans are very nice but copper is not magnetic nor is the stainless steal layer magnetic grade therefore they will not work on an induction stove . as someone else noted test your pans with a magnet . if it does not stick to the pan you will not be able to induce the magnetic field necessary to heat the pan . 
it 's really copper . 
they will handle the oven just fine . i often start a dish on the stove top and then transfer to the oven to finish . dishwasher is n't recommended if you want to keep them pretty but it should n't hurt the performance of the pans . 
do n't know the exact dimensions but pretty big . like movie poster size 
it 's 22x34 
it came rolled up in a box , but not shrink wrapped 
the answer is 3 cup bowl 5.3 x 3 ( 750 ml 13.5 cm x 7.6 cm ) 6 cup bowl 6.8 x 3.4 ( 1.5 l 17.2 cm x 8.6 cm ) 10 cup bowl 8.3 x 3.7 ( 2.5 l 21 cm x 9.4 cm ) 4.5 quart bowl 10.6 x 4.2 ( 4.5 l 26.9 cm x 10.7 cm ) 4 matching lids . i hope that this was helpful . 
according to the world kitchen website ( corningware and pyrex are registered trademarks of corning incorporated used under license by world kitchen , llc . ) , the lids are bpa free . 
the bowls are freezer and microwave safe . they can also be used in the conventional oven , but not the tops . bowls and tops are dishwasher safe . instructions for care come with the set of bowls . the measurement od the bowls is done in cups and stated on the bottoms of the bowls . the 6 cup size is a nice fit for a quart . 
only on the outside . they are very nice . 
yes , they say freezer to oven , but i always let them warm up a bit , just in case . love them . 
glass is freezer safe . just do n't go from freezer to oven . 
i would n't recommend putting these in dishwasher . most likely you would have the same problem . 
yes they can . the glass is very thick and durable . however , since you control the hand mixer , you can limit its contact with the walls of the bowl . 
i do not cook popcorn in a bowl , in the microwave . however , if it is a microwave safe bowl then probably ok. i would check it out with the manufacturer of the product . i hoped this helped you . we do love the bowls , first set lasted 20 years . we gave them away to a person of need , only because of many scratch marks within the bowls ... luv em . 
no , these are clear . 
medium grey and white , solid medium grey on back no other colors until your cat or dog walks across it with muddy paws . lesson learned if you are trying to match your wall colors do n't buy comforters sets on line best to see them in person . also comforter does not clean well either . 
hello k. green- i would n't advise using a comforter in the summer . i ca n't say for sure not knowing your climate but i would think this would be a colder weather comforter . designer living customer service 
does n't slide at all ! 
yes , these covers are very hot already . but , i must admit both my wife and u have warm blood . 
it is exactly what it looks like a bright white and gray 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the information to the right of the product picture , the 3 pillows are included in this comforter set , along with 1 x comforter , 2 x king shams , and 1 x bed skirt . have a great day ! 
hello - thank you for your interest in designer living . please see care instructions below : machine wash cold , gentle cycle , and separately . do not bleach . tumble dry low , remove promptly . do not iron . if there is no free movement in the washer or dryer , use large capacity commercial washer dryer . sincerely , krystal designer living customer service rep 1-888-879-8790 
hello , thank you for your question . the washing instructions are to machine wash on cold , separately and on a gentle cycle . you are able to tumble dry but do not iron . unfortunately i do not know if this item is reversible . i hope this helps ! 
i do n't have the package anymore but it was no larger than the standard comforter sets you see at the store 
i just washed mine and it washes up great ... just remember to change your water lever to small or medium because it does not soak up a lot of water and will cause your washer to overflow . ..i learned that the hard way . it is a great set just not as warm as i thought it would be but will be great with the weather warming up . love it ! 
i think it 's about 6 '' to 6.5 '' . they are fantastic knives ! 
they are fully ceramic - my husband loves these knives ! 
they can . gently using , cleaning & storing in a knife block help . i really like these knives and for the price wo n't freak out if i break one . i have broken more expensive ceramic knives before i bought these .

they never need to be sharpened . they are fantastic ! 
the photo is misleading . the handles are very sturdy . my only complaint it that they are not ergonomically designed . i would re-buy this set in a heartbeat , regardless . 
no 
yes a wonderful product 
i do n't know what manufacture recommends but i have washed mine in dishwasher with no negative effects to the knives regardless of size washed 
all the knives are basically the same except for length . i usually cut small items with the smaller knives such as a radish . the larger knives would cut for example , a loaf of bread . i think that is how they work best for me . i actually used the shredder to shave cocoanut . hope that helps . 
yes for the top rack 
yes 
if you want to strain the yogurt to separate out the whey , these strainers are not fine enough mesh , i think . i use them constantly for kefir . 
yes 
this is difficult to answer for sure , but i do n't think the resins used in this would contain bpa . first is the mesh part of the strainer , which is supposed to be nylon ( probably nylon 6 ) . then the surrounding structure and handle appear to be either polypropylene or polyethylene ( no # 7 recycling symbol or other symbol is molded into mine ) . to my knowledge , none of these three resins are associated with bpa , which is more commonly found in polycarbonate ( and maybe polystyrene ) resins . 
yes , they seem sturdy enough to do that . 
the smaller strainer has a finer mesh 
they 're not plastic . they 're nylon . 
not really . it can sit there cockeyed with the handle angled downwards . the small one is perfect , however , for a 2-cup glass measuring cup . the larger one is perfect for a 4-cup glass measuring cup . they both sit anchored and level . 
i believe they are . if not exactly , they 're very similar . i hope this helps you ! 
yes , it is . with four bolts on the feet , it should withstand a karate kick . 
no there is no tilt option . this kit is literally a set of universal `` legs '' to replace the original stand that came with your tv . as a mount to stand your tv on a table top these are perfect . if you need a tilt , then i suggest you look at a wall mount . 
yes . it comes with multiple sizes of mounting screws . you should not have a problem . i 've bought multiple of this mount and have n't had a problem attaching to a tv yet . 
enough for 1 tv . each `` leg '' has 3 pieces that you put together . 
i would say probably not . my 42 '' lcd weighs around 60 lbs and seems surprisingly stable 
if you turn the lags around it will work i have mine done this way and it works great 
my tv is a 26 inch and works fine on it . however we do not have the tv at the highest spot on the brackets so the brackets are sticking above the tv by a few holes . it is in the bedroom so we did n't care about that . it is very sturdy and we have not even had a close call with it falling over . we have our cable box under the tv between the leg brackets . i think it should work for a 19 inch tv 
no , there is just not enough to hold it if it should start to sway back and forth . 
if your tv comes with the mounting bolts in the back , it should . 
no.. you ca n't turn it around so that the feet are facing the back of the tv ... they only stick out only like only 2.5 inches in front of the tv ... 
i keep an old toothbrush for such purposes in my arsenal of kitchen tools . 
only one direction 
if instructions did not come with your peeler , tell the company when they contact you via email after the sale -- they were great about sending the instructions out to me via pdf file . i believe the address to contact precisionkitchenware directly via amazon marketplace is : bsv77tlrhgws51v @ marketplace.amazon.com . to contact precisionkitchenware directly : francesca @ precisionkitchenware.com . hope this helps . 
i used it on a yam ( sweet potato ) and it worked fine . i did use a glove to hold it so i would n't cut myself . cut a piece off a rounded veggie so it `` sits '' more firmly on your cutting board . the first slice of the peeler was hard but it got progressively easier . 
not unless you have 2 hours . it get 's clogged up constantly . tried on squash and it was a disaster . i am going to get something better for this . 
the tool is about 7.5 in . long and the peeler is about 2.75 in . wide . it has a standard peeler on one side and a julienne peeler on the other side . it has a metal handle that is oval and about 1 in . wide . it feels good in the hand . i used it to peel and cut zucchini and carrots , and i found it very easy to use . it is quite sharp so you need to be careful and use a fork and non slippery surface when cutting food , or you could get hurt . my mother had severe arthritis and she would have had a difficult time using this tool , but someone with minor problems would be able to use this in my opinion . it does work easier than a standard peeler . it is very smooth that way . i imagine i will get even faster as i use it and get used to it . 
unfortunately it does n't shred cabbage , it just makes a big mess . i would stick with squash and carrots . 
this item does not take batteries 
the peeler is manufactured in china . 
the box says `` designed in london , england . made in china . '' 
it makes 4 small at one time . you can use the sticks or not . i like this waffler because the ears are indented . my grandfather always said butter and syrup in every hole so this is perfect ! 
i bought this for my son & daughter in law , my grandson is 1 1 2 yrs . old , they do n't use the sticks yet . my grandson loves mickey mouse , they even make blueberry waffles too ! 
according to the instructions , `` approximately 1 4 cup '' ( 2 ounces ) . 
i found some at smart and final . coffee stirrers . 
i 'm not sure if it can handle foreign outlet but it works on a standard american outlet . hth . 
110 
they are about 4 '' square and will not be too thick to put in your toaster : ) 
14.6 h x 8.3 w x 9.1 d inches 
it beeps a bit , not that loud ( not as loud as the microwave for example ) i do n't think you can turn it off or make it louder . 
doubt it , usually have to put it in the microwave right out of the pot . 
it is stainless steel 
yes , this information is correct . 
try unplugging it wait ten seconds and plugging it back in . it should re-set itself to the factory default . if not , call frigidaire at 1800 374 4432 for customer service and have your model number . 
yes it beeps . ( about 3 ) love them as i then know when coffee is ready . 
yes , you can do that 
i think it will be hard to clean , like most coffemakers . i guess the filter that it has might help with hard water . 
i order them through amazon . 
dear dejavu , thank you for your interest in the rachael raye product line . if used on the largest burner it will be approximately 14 inches . thank you for allowing me to assist you with your request . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
dear kenneth , thank you for your inquiry . yes your product is oven safe to : oven temperature 350 thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
not sure . i love the size but never sat flat n only middle touches stove . bad design 
no , it does not . we have a flat surface cooktop and it stays in place very nicely . 
11 1 2 rim 9 '' actual cooking space 
dear consumer , thank you for your inquiry . yes we do have rachael ray 12 inch deep skillets available , sku 's 77668 , 77666,77667. thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . sincerely , tonia d . 
this particular pan measures 14 '' diameter on the top edges . the bottom surface is approx 12 '' that covers the burner . a nice large pan . hope that helps . 
of course u can just do not use metal utensils . i have fried chicken in it multiple times works great 
yes , that is the type of stove i have and i use it on there several times a week 
this is the best pan i have . it 's maybe 3 or 4 inches deep . 
i 've purchased two and both were pretty close to picture color . 
yes it is 
i got the navy one ... color is dark as shown . pleating has not held after few washing ... it is not pleated in many places anymore ... not recommended if you wash once per month . 
it is as pictured . i love this comforter . 
hi theresa ... i bought this for my daughter ( who also has 2 cats ) but she has n't used it just yet . i hope it does n't attract a lot of hair ! ! ! she wo n't be using it until she moves at the end of may , so i 'm afraid i wo n't have an answer to that question until then : ( 
it plugs into the pad at the top on both sides . each side is independently heated . this is a great pad . i have another pad on top of mine because i do n't like feeling the heating ribs . it works just fine either way . hope you enjoy yours as we have enjoyed ours . 
when the controls are off the are not backlit . the controls are large red orange buttons . when any of the buttons is clicked the choice is lit . the controls are easy to use . i have purchased three of these pads and am very pleased with them . hope you enjoy yours . 
no , it does n't make any noise . it is a very good buy . i have two king sized and am very pleased with the quality , size and price . 
it will fit just fine . make sure it is on delicate . the fabric is thin . 
we have a cat and i have to use a lint brush but it comes off 
hello ! this product is made in china . if you have any other questions , please let us know . thank you for your interest , rachel eluxurysupply customer service 
you might contact the actual seller directly . i received a hand-written thank you note from the company in my order . here 's their contact info : 800.977.7433 eluxury supply 
no ( assuming you order the king size ) . i have mine on a pillow top queen , and it fits perfectly ! 
no , i have yet to find any but if you look on west elm ( high priced ) or blowout bedding ( low priced ) they have some interesting ( funky ) patterns that are cool . if you go with the grey pinch , plain white or pastel colors match up well with it . remember the pinch is the focus of the bedroom and you do n't want to have too much of it in the room . also go with a throw blanket and you can change up the color with matching sheets for the throw . regardless of what size bed you have get the cal-king unless you have a twin bed , it looks a lot better touching the floor . i wish i could post you a pic of what i mean . i hope my suggestions help . good day , h 
truthfully i would n't recommend it if you get hot easily . this comforter looks light but it 's very heavy and very warm . it is a good comforter overall . 
no , it is a comforter . 
100 % polyester 
this comforter is pretty lightweight in the sense it is not a heavy , but it is warm . i love this comforter , so i would order it anyway . you could always use it later if you find it to be too warm . 
yes it came with one 
does n't seem to ! but even if it did the pleats would disguise it well . 
i would not wash it ... prob could b but i have had others where the batting bunches up ... 
no it 's thickness is actually pretty decent and i will sometimes use it as my primary blanket when i sleep so i do n't think it 's itchy at all . 
i have not purchased any curtains yet . we just have blinds up . we are decorating our room with a gray and yellow theme . i 'm looking for curtains with both dark and light gray with some yellow in it . 
it 's full it 's not oversized 
no , it is a comforter . 
i do n't know . you would have to contact the company that made it . it 's light weight , and that 's what i wanted . i do n't like heavy bedspreads or comforters that are heavy and bulky . i do n't use it when i sleep . i fold it down to the end of the bed so it wo n't get all wrinkled up . i 'm very picky , and i really like this . i got the orange and it looks great . i have n't washed it yet , so we 'll see how that goes . 
the color looks gray . good luck 
these pillowcases do not have zippers- it is the standard clothe foldover on the back 
no , this is a small chair and will not accommodate or support even a small adult . it is really `` great for kids '' , not adults . 
i got this chair for our 7 yr old grandson for christmas . he has n't sat in it yet , but i did . it was sturdy for me and i weigh 110lbs . you may have to help your child getting in and out of it and make sure that the legs are locked into place . if you do order this chair , i hope you will be happy with it , as i am , and i know our grandson will love it . i hope i was helpful to you . merry christmas . 
i believe this one is also nylon . but it is super soft ! 
thanks for your query . the dimensions of the chair are 30.0 l x 28.0 w x 29.0 h , weight capacity is 225 pounds . if your 13 year old wants to sit in it cross-legged it may be too small . the cover is spot clean only . 
we have been using 1 cup , i flip the brewer over a few times during the process to mix everything up . works great . and yes the filter is quite full . we add a little extra water as well 
hi there , the 2 qt . is a little taller than a carton of milk . i do not own the 1 qt . so i am sorry , i do n't have the exact dimensions . my 2 qt . fits fine in the door of my fridge where i store juices , milk and cream . this product is awesome . i love it ... . i was a casual tea drinker and now i am a bit addicted because it is so easy to make a pitcher . good luck ! 
my experience using both systems is that the toddy makes a more concentrated , stronger brew . the takeya is pretty strong especially if you let it go a full 24 hours or longer , but the toddy is still a bolder brew . hope this helps ... 
i would n't worry too much since this system makes fairly weak concentrate . just follow the instructions . 
plastic 
you should use only course ground coffee . either buy a grinder and do it yourself or buy beans at a coffee shop and gave them ground for you . 
i have n't had that problem . maybe you are grinding too finely or there is a hole in the netting . 
the one time i made hot coffee with the concentrate i poured water from my kettle into the cup which had the concentrate in it . i mainly use the the tekaya to brew thai iced tea . 
you do n't use boiling water in a cold brew , i full the basket about 3 4 then full with cold water and let it sit in the refrigerator over night 
no i have only tried other brand which is easy to use and tastes good . 
follow the link below : http : www.overstock.com home-garden 62-inch-urban-blend-ash-grey-media-tower 8379052 product.html 
this product is made with high-grade mdf and durable laminate . 
it is not solid wood . it 's particle board like most all tv stands in this price range . thus far i have n't noticed any longevity issues ( though i have n't had it for more than a few months ) and it seems like it will last longer than the stand it replaced .

that big space there ? that 's where you put your dvd player , dvr , cable box , or game consoles . and that hole in that back of the space is where you feed the wires of those things to plug them into the wall or power strip so they are out of sight . 
there are limited instructions . it is pretty much a basic recipe for plain yogurt . there are so many different things you can add to it , pretty much whatever fruit , granola , or honey suits you . it is easier to make yogurt than using the stove-top method since you do not have to monitor the temperature . you just let the yogurt maker do it for you . in my opinion , it would be better if it had a timer , but for the price we think it is a good machine . we make yogurt for the whole family and like not having to wash out individual tubs . making it in one large batch works well for us since different family members eat different amounts in a meal . 
a standard quart plastic tub of store bought yogurt fits in ... however , the jar provided with the yogurt maker is much better plastic to use than the regular quart plastic jar of store bought yogurt . 
yes , it is very important to heat the milk first , as the yogurt maker simply holds it to the temperature that it has been cooled down to , what i do is , i heat the milk in a double boiler , have more control that way , and wo n't burn the milk , you will also need to stir it to keep it mixed up , aslo , i do add about 1 cup of powdered milk to it so it is thicker when done . i use the included thermometer to moniter the temp , then when it gets to around 180 degrees , i move it over to the sink that i have filled with ice water , i use the reusable icecubes and rainwater that i collect for the cool down water , it needs to be cooled to 120 degrees , then , i pour about 1 cup of the cooled down liquid into the culture that i saved from the last batch , then when dissolved i add it to the rest of the milk mixture , then after it is in the yogurt maker i leave it for about 8 hours , this has worked very well for me for quite a long time , i have been doing it for so long now that i just automatically do it the same way every time , there a so few steps , it is so fast . i hope 
works better . the only drink that is not the greatest is the one that they have on the box . the rainbow one . other than that , the recipes are amazing and it works great ! 
there 's no app for the kindle 
i 'm not quite sure about the app in uk , the name of the app to download is called perfect drink . it works well just as described 
it includes the scale , the tablet phone stand , 2 pouring spots , and a stainless steel shaker . 
sorry it has no date anywhere on it or the box . 
yes it will . wo n't look as nice as on the ipad because of the smaller screen but works the same . 
you can not use the scale for inventory purposes , but the app that you can download for free will keep track . 
yes 
no 
yes 
if you contact these people , they will be able to connect you with the correct wand . they were very helpful for us : cleanfreaks @ builtinvacuum.com or just call this number : 1-800-997-2278 
not sure . i had a nutone system and bought the newest nutone head only and had to return it , because the head did n't fit the wand . i could n't find any knowledge base to know what works with what . so i just kept buying things and returning them until i got something that fit . 
i just replaced existing head that was the same type , so am usure why type of hose i already had . sorry . 
i 'm not sure of what you mean exactly as there 's no traditional power cord on this . on the neck of the device are the power prongs ( two round gold pins ) that snap into my existing long vacuum neck that has the power cord running up it . 
yes -- this brush will work with all standard central vacuums . 
i purchased it for my ct600 & it 's a perfect replacement . 
my wife cooks 2 large in 7 minutes on high . yes , this does go against the directions but we all know the directions are there to make sure people do n't hurt themselves and then sue the manufacturer . just make sure you do n't put the microwave in the tub and then try and cook on high . 8- ) 
only when it shows signs of dirtiness 
china 
no , on page 2 of the instruction booklet it says , `` do not peel or poke holes in the potatoes ! '' 
it cooks a much better potato ... both plain and sweet ! 
yes i used high 
sadly , you can do the same thing in a brown paper bag 15 seconds . 
i 've tried various temperatures and the bag still does not cook my potato as advertised . 
the exterior is 100 % polyester . the lining is 85 % polyester and 15 % cotton . you wash it inside out and lay it flat to dry . ps it says it will hold up to 4 potatoes . my 2 russets filled it up . 
not advised . i tried & burned the bag . cook 3 1 2 minutes . remove & toss potatoes a little check doneness then cook additional time as needed . just not over 4 minutes at a time . i have much success this way . good luck . 
infrared space heaters for the home emit long-wave infrared radiation , which strikes a solid nearby object and converts that radiation into heat . infrared is not absorbed by the air through which it travels . with infrared heating , the warmth is directed and concentrated where it is really needed , so infrared heaters are better at targeted or focused heating . infrared heaters are energy efficient , have no moving parts , heat very quickly , are silent , and are unaffected by drafts . if you are sitting in one spot for a length of time , an infrared heater aimed in your direction will be a good choice convection heaters use electricity to warm a metal coil , a quartz tube , or a ceramic core . the air near the heater is warmed in the process and , using either natural or fan-induced convection currents , circulated throughout the room . quartz and ceramic elements are reputed to reach higher temperatures with less input energy than their metal-coil counterparts and are thus said to be more efficient . they work well for providing overall warmth in a ( small ) closed space . in all models , the warmed air circulates into the room , raising the ambient temperature to the point established by the thermostat , and then shutting off until the temperature drops . if you are moving around in a room , or if there are several people in the room , a quartz or ceramic convection heater will be a good choice . they are both safe heating systems 
1 year 
1500 watts 5100 btu max 
it 's hard to say . we have been using a similar infrared for over a year with no real electric spikes . i do n't think it added much more than $ 10 a month with usage in the evening most every day . we just purchased 2 of these and have them running round the clock to avoid our propane furnace running . we also have a small empty rental that we have our other infrared at . it is currently heating the whole house round the clock . 
i live in upstate ny in a mobile home about 1000 sq ft-this heater with a little propane heater keeps our home comfortable even at 10 degrees outside-the fan only runs when the heater is working and for a couple minutes after heater shuts down-it does not run all the time-i do n't know how cold it gets there in maine where u are but i think this heater might do it 
the unit 's control panel has no battery back-up system to `` remember '' what state of operation it was in prior to a loss of power . the heater defaults to the off when power is lost , then restored . 
yes , it rolls smoothly ... 
i 'm not sure what the difference is . i just know they ca n't run on a circuit with a lot of other things or they will trip circuit breaker . i had to move mine and put it on a different circuit but it has n't caused me a problem other than that . i really have n't figured out why it 's called plug and play . 
yes 
not a clue- all i know is that i downloaded because i paid for it and also am not happy with the product -it really raises electric bill . 
you just squeeze until you get the amount of batter that you need . it 's very manageable , however . the hole at the bottom of the dispenser is about dime size so you 're not going to get a vast amount of cake batter flowing uncontrolably . you 'll have total control over the amount coming out . i especially love that feature in getting the cake batter into the cupcake muffin papers . no mess or fuss . hope this helps . 
the one time i used this , i mixed the batter and then put it in the dispenser . i was making cupcakes -- - and it worked great until the mechanism that allows the dispenser at the bottom to open , broke . i tried to fix it , but evidently i do n't have the expertise . this is a great idea -- just not as sturdy as it might be . 
depending on how thick the batter is it can be tough , it also depends on how well you can hold it up in the air also . the regular cake batter was fine and not alot of pressure , it dispenses nice and clean . 
yes you can and yes you can control the amount for pancakes and muffins and it works great , 
yes ! ! i wash mine by hand because the dishwasher water tends to pool in one spot . but it only takes a minute ! ! i love mine so much that it 's several people 's christmas gifts this year . 
yes 
thicker cupcake batter did not work , so unless your brownie batter is super thin , i 'd say no . 
hello , it is purple . just like the picture . : - ) 
i have n't had a problem with the batter thickness - if you 're putting pieces of anything into the batter like chocolate chips , then it will collect at the bottom opening and clog - the only time it 's been too thick is when i beat in the eggs for a long time until the egg sugar butter mixture is thick and fluffy - then it 's impossible to use - but i 've used lots of mixes with it too and works great - it 's still possible to drip a bit with runnier batter , so keep a napkin or small piece of paper towel beneath it 
i 'm not really sure of the question but if it has to do with the packaging being eco friendly then i can tell you i was very pleased with the way the item was packaged . i hope this was helpful . 
i 'd have to count again but it is either 26 or 28 cupcakes total . works like a dream unless you want candles in the cupcakes . the tiers are a little too close together to get a candle in every one . 
yes it does , simply unscrew each tier 
this is why i love this product , you can use as many or few as you want : ) 
it will hold the big cupcakes 
there 's 3.5 '' between each tier , but because they 're a petal shape , you can position each tier to allow for some more space for the tier above . hope this helps . i love mine and wanted to post pictures from our last party but i could n't upload them . 
yes , it works on memory foam as well . 
no ! it 's advertised but this particular model does not have the pre-heat feature ! i was not very happy when i discovered this ! ! 
a king-size mattress is a different size from a california king . so , the answer is 'no ' . 
no not at all . it 's actually really comfortable . the wires are pretty thin . 
i 'm not really sure as of yet . we have n't tried to wash it yet . so we are curious about this also 
no . this works on a 110 volt receptacle . 
absolutely . my husband rarely has his side on but mine is on low all night and it 's more than warm enough even for me who is always cold . 
sleigh beds are difficult for any of the mattress warmers on the market . what i did was put a small cloth over the headboard to avoid scratches and hung the controls over the cloth . i always knew where to find the control . 
of course it will.warm your feet depending on your sleep position . 
you will need the convertor changing 110 to 220 and set on 1500 or highest wattage . 
no that is the dark taupe . i have the lighter one which is the walnut 
i got these from ikea . torsby vilsmar 
it is more gray with some areas that have some light tan taupe marks . it 's really nice in person , but it 's definitely not brown . 
from my floor to the underside of the skirting on the table it is 25 inches roughly . 
yes 
particle board and medium density fiberboard ... it 's basically saying it 's not solid wood . but , i bought one and it 's really nice looking . you would never know the difference . 
no sorry ! i love mine , but i would not use bar stools for it . it 's perfect how it is . maybe making the bottom shelf with more space would be the best thing because a lot of my bottles do n't fit in the bottom shelf . 
shelves are almost a foot . wine glasses hang hover a few in above the shelving . the problem is you can only use wine glasses with the smallest bottom base . i went out to pier one and bought over $ 100 worth of wine glasses only to have to take them back and hunt for glasses with very small bottoms that fit the wine rings . 
15.5 '' x 47.25 '' and it is 42 '' bar height 
it should be fine as long as the bar is on a flat level surface . during the assembly i make see what other measures i could take to increase the stability , such as glue it increased screws . but that would just be as a precaution as it 's pretty sturdy from the start . 
dark brown 
yes the unit i received was black . 
none 
no 
bottom 11 '' , middle 11 1 2 '' , and top 8 '' 
very . the legs need to be put on with little assembly but once together it is very sturdy . you can buy some rubber feet to stick on the bottom to help it from moving as well . 
it measures 47 '' from the inside of one leg to the next . its enough for two regular chairs 
i wold say more like pergo flooring 
this listing is for the table only 
no , i did it by myself and usually i 'm not good in assembling furnitures . maybe it takes a bit longer but it 's not impossible . 
thanks for your question , according to a supplier , this desk measures 37.75 '' h x 35.75 '' w x 18 '' d. the desk is described as `` extremely sturdy and very functional '' . amazon.com offers returns for most items within 30 days of receipt of shipment . you can read more here : 
it is 36 '' . 18 '' deep and stands 29.5 '' high at the front to the work surfice . my wife loves it . 
they are fixed with dowels and screws and ore drilled for placement . can not be moved . 
the bottom part is . however , the back of the hutch has the screw heads exposed and just a light coat of paint . kind of roughly finished . 
i can have this item shipped and delivered in 5 - 7 days based on your location . 
yes it could be , i do n't think it is very deep tho . 
i would say vintage matt and a sort of antique feel to it . it does n't look shiny like new . the colors are a little muted..in the best way : ) 
it is 32w , 36h , 14d . the 3 drawers are about 8 '' wide 
wood ... i believe it is a wood composite . 
when this arrived at my house some of it was broken . but the cabinet doors did not match up , one was lower than the other . it was not well made . 
no , we do n't feel wires through the sheets . 
the controls are at the foot of the bed . you can move the controls by turning the mattress pad around and putting the controls at the top of the bed ... .which is what i did . it also made it easier to plug the unit in because my outlet on the wall is at the top of my bed . we either put the controls under our pillow or on the nightstand . this is a very nice addition to our room which is an ice box at night . hope this helps . 
make sure your bedsread is heavy enough to hold the heat . also if you are not in the bed and put your hand on it it wo n't seem warm . mine was warm enough but the controller kept blinking and shutting of the heat . i replaced it with a biddeford which does n't seem very warm . oh well . 
i would have to say the coils are evenly distributed . i do not notice any more than the other . 
the plug is three prong 
no 
i bought one couple years ago and it last for about 3 years . and i thought it was because i kept it on in summer . so i am hoping this one will last longer than that if i do take it off from mattress in summer . 
yes 
yes . 
first , there are two heat controls . the cord length was a significant design flaw . the cord is very short on the side away from the plug and barely long enough on the other side . 
unfortunately not . when i built it , the instructions and everything was designed for the bookcase to be on the right side . 
it 's definitely particle board . 
yep - actually just grab your instructions - they will ship the part once you request it . as i recall all you do is follow the instructions by listing the part number that was damaged and they send a replacement . they do not even ask for the old one back which makes it handy . just ask them and they send it : ) 
the material is a little different . mine is exposed . it 's white and looks awesome : ) you should get it . i love it . 
yes it is . but careful the last you want to install it should be the sliding glasses . costumer service is excellent if you need any replacement or help . 
it 's unfortunate that the package did n't come with instructions . i 've had this desk now for a few months and i threw all that stuff away , sorry . 
i had thoughts of doing the same thing but the glass cabinet only has the pre-drilled holes on the top to match the photo setup . you could put the glass cabinet on the left if you were okay with having the top part of the desk just sit on ( not be screwed into ) the glass cabinet . i was n't , so i have it setup as seen in the photo . 
yes they are sliding doors . however there is no handle on the door so it can be a little tricky to slide the glass doors . shelf can be accessed easily . 
we had asked same question and was told yes , but hat was not the case . we made it work by flipping the side table so that the sliding doors faced out not in and leaving back off so there was access to shelves . only reason i did not send back was because my son is going to take it and use it 
yes it is grey . 
hi , the details you were looking for are as follows : item specifications length ( in ) :44 width depth ( in ) :16 height ( in ) :32 go ahead & make a purchase , we strive to offer best product & services . thank you , stores123 . 
grey 
so i pulled out my tape measure- 44 1 4 `` from left outside bolt to right outside bolt . 
yes definetly . it 's very sturdy . 
15 3 4 '' deep . it is beautiful , good quality , and easy to put together . 
i think the dimensions listed on the piece were switched with the side table dimensions . the correct dimensions are : 32h x 16d x 44l it 's a great piece ! nice a sturdy and was easy to assemble . 
do n't ever do that . the top neither the glass is heat resistant . unless you want to ruin your investment . 
no . not at all . it s very stable 
32 '' lengths and 44 '' wide . i hope it helps 
they are really hard to find and very expensive , if you want something with the same look , i would go to ikea

it 's just the dinky wedge that goes in the corner . very misleading pic . the actual desk is like 400 bucks . 
it is literally just the wedge that fits in the corner . it is shaped like a slice of pie .

no , this is the corner piece that connects two monarch 7027 desks . 
i use a double loader at the laundry-mat on gentle cycle , cold water , regular detergent . fyi i also use the giant laundry-mat dryer alternating between no heat and low heat for about 15 minutes each over 1 and a half hrs . then i lay the comforter over a double clothes line at home for at least 24 hrs to air dry completely . it 's worth the bother . i love my silk comforter ! ! also need to mention i remove the cover at home and hang it to dry separately . 
the color of the cover is white . 
yes the cover is white , as indicated in the below pictures on the website , and the material is also mulberry silk . 
yes it can be dry cleaned . please note that the deluxe all-silk comforter is very high-end product and it requires careful handling . you can use dry clean but with low or warm temperature only to maintain the smoothness of the silk surface and the softness of the inside silk filling . 
i think israel 
sorry , i 'm not the seller maybe you can refer the question to him 
suction base ? what for ? i do n't understand the question i will be mire then happy to answere any question i can say that it is the most useful tool in my kitchen 
off course ! you can prepare chopped liver , chicken salad , egg salad and many more things . 
yes it is that easy and fast ! ! ! ! the youtube pic shows exactly teh recipe and how long it takes . you should try it . it helped our whole family change our lifestyle to a healthier one . 
i actually purchased this vacuum at costco because i was there and was able to look at it and saw that it had a brush attachment . i know the same vacuum is cheaper at amazon and if i buy another ( for a backup vacuum ) i 'll definitely get it from amazon and perhaps one that has more attachments , although i 'm perfectly happy with this vacuum . as for the 356 model , that one comes with more attachments , the 352 also seems to come with an extra crevasse tool ( there are two sizes in the box . i hope this helps . 
it 's bag-less . there 's a filter you have to rinse with water now and then . over time you will need to replace it . it 's just a rectangular piece of foam so it ca n't cost much . 
i used it with the canister off because i had to reach up to 12 ft. ceilings . it was awkward to leave the canister on but you could do it that way . the canister is easy to remove . 
less than one pound on my bathroom scales . 
yes , the highest point of vac is 4 inches . 
it can stretch about 7-8 ft. i did not have time to measure it so that is an estimate but at least 7ft . 
there is likely pet hair or the like that is obstructing the roller from rolling . once you take care of that it should be fine . i do it about every third time i vacuum . i have two dogs shed profusely . great vacuum . 
you just have to look them up . the base model does not have the canister lift off . the middle model ( professional ) the canister lifts off and the top of the line the canister comes with a little base with wheels . one may be an older year model . 
it should just snap back in when you align it properly and push down . 
35 feet 
i 'm not familiar with the texture of wheat berries . the only process similar that i 've done is make almond milk , however , it did not fully fine chop the almonds . keep in mind , almonds are very hard nuts so that may have played an important part in the end result . just a suggestion , why not use the simple hand mill coffee grinder ( much more economical ) . they usually run about $ 15- $ 35 good luck ! 
yes 
this unit is 1200 watt system . 
it 's more classified as a blender -- fruit or veggie : e.g , apples , pears , peaches , kiwis , carrots , celery , etc totally break down and blend together all parts of the fruit veggie to include all the fiber , vitamins , nutrients into your juice or smoothie drink . i believe traditional juicers remove the fiber from juice veggies at least the one i had did . so in a sense i guess it could be considered a high performance juicer but much much more ! hope this helps ! 
have n't had any issues so far . ours seems to blend right through it all really easily . 
revised my response june 8 , 2014 : returned this system to store & interesting enough , the clerk said she had rec 'd several as returns since december 2013 w similar complaint . got this as a xmas 2013 present ( hubby paid $ 179.00+tax for system ) . the individual smoothie system is gr8 , blends well and smooth . excellent power ! however , the food processer malfunctioned . have used it to make pizza dough , cookies & bread ( overall about 5 times ) . worked okay for pulse but then red light began to flash when making cookies , so had to check overall system , checked connection , base placement , food processor lock feature , when making bread after a few times , the base became unstable ( shakey ) . i unlocked base and made certain the table surface was free of debris and again , placed locked base ... after a few seconds , base became wobbly again . i checked all applicable areas on system to ensure they were connected , locked in place prior to returning to store . note : i had replaced my cuisinart food processer and mixer with this system but glad i did n't throw out because i had to revert to using them again . just wanted to update based on my experience with system as of today ! by the way i noticed alice 's reference is for another model ninja mega kitchen system the seller is selling an entirely different system , see the graphic provided by seller & # 9658 ; supra kitchen system i have this system . this system has 1200 watts 1.5 horse power and here 's what is included : xl blender : 72 oz pitcher w pour spout , 6 blade assembly xl food processer mixer dough maker : 8 cup bowl , 4 blade assembly , dough blade two single serve cups ( nutrient & vitamin extraction and frozen blending , smoothies ) , 2 travel lids , single serve blades , instruction booklet recipe booklet good luck ! 
i 'm not familiar with ninja mega , but i googled it and mega has more power , 1500 watts whereas this has 1200 watts . price for mega is about 10.00 more . look here to read more http : www.amazon.com ninja-mega-kitchen-system-bl771 dp b00a3d5iz6 
yes 
just the feet ... easy 
yes , perhaps even 2 . 
approximately 3 ' x 21.25 '' x 8.5 '' deep 
dark brown 
firm 
it 's a polyester blend , easy to clean 
it 's 17 inches tall . hope that helps 
yes it is padded the whole way around . enjoy ! ! 
it is 22 inches wide and 38 inches long and 17 inches high . the storage is 8 inches deep . 
if you really wanted to , you could retrofit the window with plywood , but it would n't be pretty . 
about 5 ft . 
yes . 
yes ! it will fit up to a 36 '' wide window 
it does n't come with a sleeve that i could see . 
yes 
i measured my unit and it is 19 '' wide by 12 '' tall so in my opinion it would not fit . the 19 '' is just the unit leaving no room on either side also . i hope this helps ! 
i do n't live in a mobile home but the house i 'm in is not insulated well and it cools a good size room just fine .

this scale can weigh in fractions of pounds ( 100.2 pounds ) , but not under one pound . if you click on 'smart weigh ' which is a link under the product title , you 'll go to an amazon page that has kitchen scales and other scales that can measure in grams . 
hello pavan . i understand you are experiencing difficulties with your product . perhaps there is a reason for the fluctuation . have you placed the scale on a steady surface , free of movement and or vibration ? for further assistance , you can contact me directly via email [ esty @ measupro.com ] or telephone [ 855-797-2253 ] . kind regards , esty smart weigh scales 
there are lots of things that can effect a scales accuracy . ie : carpet , uneven tile , leaning one way or another . to use mine i have to move it out from the wall place it on even tile , ( challenging because my bathroom has small tiles ) stand up straight , and not tough anything ( like the wall for balance ) . 
it takes 2 2032 lithium batteries 
please remove the plastic from the battery compartment and you can then just step on 
yes , it stays on for about 5 seconds . 
pretty sure they rest under a snap on latch on the under side . personally i do n't care for the accuracy of this scale . should have spent more for a better one . 
not sure but it 's pretty lightweight in comparison to other scales i 've used 
no 
flat surface like tile 
i have a large living room , dining room , kitchen combo and another 10 x14 room off of the dining room . all connected . the heater does work well down into the 30s but it runs all the time . it does n't put out a large amount of heat but it keeps the main living room cozy . it would have to be a smaller area to make it get too hot . it will not replace your furnace but it does help to keep the furnace from coming on as much . i had a 4 element heater but returned it right away and bought this product instead . 
hi , there is a 1 year manufacturer 's warranty for defects on workmanship . if there are any issues at all , we can be reached here through the amazon sellers message board and will gladly assist you . i hope this helps . please let us know if we can possibly help with anything else . thank you ! 
hi , glad to assist : ) . there is a 1 year manufacturer 's warranty for this heater . i hope this helps and thanks for looking : ) . thanks , o-ion 
this scale comes precalibrated with a readability of 1 gram and a weight capacity of 11 lbs . 5 kg . 
it uses lithium battery 3v cr2032 . they 're not expensive . http : www.walmart.com ip insten-5pcs-cr-2032-cr2032-3v-lithium-button-cell-coin-battery 31515503 
no , the minimum is 1 gram . 
yes it does . however , remember that ml is a volume , mg is a weight . one ml is the volume of one mg water . or , more clearly stated , if a bottle is a 500 ml bottle , it will weigh 500 mg if water fills it . if something lighter than water , such as oil , fills it , it will weigh less and the reading of mls will be less , even though the volume is still 500 mls . 
made in china 
it is accurate as to my knowledge ... i use it 2 three times a day . for postage i think it 's just fine ! it 's a good product at a fair price . 
it 's an auto shut off ; however , i 've always had time to add or remove something . it does n't shut off rapidly , but it comes back on instantly when you touch the power bar . i like this product a lot . 
no it does not . i would not recommend buying this one . i 'm not impressed . for the money . 
no it does not . 
no . the weight is only there while the product is on . 
yes it have it a the bottom.thank you vevry much 
rolled up . had no creases came in nicely packaged and was definitely a good buy 
hello i love my poster and it is . 23ish by 22 and a half inches . i hope i could help 
uhh . normal poster size . like the ones at walmart 
i just did the math . if it was 3 lbs ft^2 it would weigh 15.4 lbs , the shipping weight is 14.4 lbs . however that is using the stated dimensions and it is fairly common that mattress pads are a few inches small in both directions which could easily account for the missing weight . 
the 2-inch memory mattress topper is just the blue part . 
something that zips so can be removed but is somewhat tight so it does n't bunch . i used a thin cotton one i had left over from the last time i purchased a topper . hope this helps : ) 
100 % you will need a cover for this , especially waterproof . the item has sticky substance and do not recommend for a baby . 
i would not know why it could not be cut . i would use a box cutter to do it as sissors might have a difficult time doing it . 
oh my gosh yes . it 's amazing . like , genuinely amazing . i have one on my bed and one on one of the guest beds and i 've actually packed one with me before when visiting my parents because they have a harder guest bed . 
it adds two inches to the total height of mattress so it depends on the thickness of the underlying mattress . we did n't need to on this topper , however , the mattress at our main bed did require an additional cover , thicker mattress plus topper was three inches . 
the pad is 2 inches thick and it is slightly smaller than my queen mattress . it is not a significant difference though . ordering a larger size may be the answer if you are concerned about it being to small 
yes i think it is ! 
it 's a topper 
the item was shipped in a box . it was packaged in a drawstring bag inside the box . 
i did not try this ! but it appears that you could cut it down to needed size ! it is like a big sponge ! 
yes it is in stock . 
yes i have mine on a twin size mattress 
the density of this memory foam is 3 lbs . 
it fully expands to the dimensions in sellers description . have had for about 12 weeks and satisfied . 
2 '' of memory pad . the white under it shows you how it sits on a mattress . 
there is only one layer 2 inches thick . 
look deeper into the product description . 
yes it is washable . 
no its not childish i 'm almost 40 and bought it because i love animal print and just changed my bedroom decor . lol ! : ) 
comforter and 2 matching pillow shams . 
yes 
yes it does fit on a queen size bed also very comfortable and very practical also looks great 
hello john , this ia just a print comforter 
hello carolyn , the color is plain solid charcoal gray . thanks ! 
yes , it can be rolled up and put in a fiddle bag . depending on your bed size , it might take a large duffle . after unrolling , it should n't take long to expand back to size . 
i guess the best answer i can give for this is that regular memory foam feels `` dryer '' or `` crisper '' to me . it 's still squishy , but you do n't sink into the bed as much and it has a little bit more resistance . this gel infused one feels more dense and that makes it more squishy for some reason . i like it much better than the regular memory foam . 
i have a mattress pad on top of it & it does n't get hot at all . in fact , thats one of the things i love about it ! 
there is no cover with this and i do n't think one is available . i just used a mattress pad over it 
yes , but we recommend only using it on the lowest setting . 
hell yeah it will ! i love the sleep master : ) 
this is very comfortable to sleep on and it 's not hot . 
i found my bed more comfortable with this on , and my bed was already soft to begin with . soft and comfort are both subjective though , so i ca n't guarantee you 'll have the same experience . 
yes , this will help make a sofa bed more comfortable . 
i would n't recommend this for that . was to squishy for my liking . im about the same size and i would sink into it like play dough and it was hard to get out of . also it 's super heavy and refuses to stay rolled up . 
it is not recommended that any of our products be cut to size . this can cause separation and shifting of the foam as well as voids the warranty . 
if you cover both the mattress and the pad together , you will need the extra deep sheets . the regular sheets are too small . 
the dimensions of our twin sized toppers are 39 '' x 75 '' . 
i have blue side up . very comfy 
the density of this memory foam is 3 lbs . per cubic foot . 
the dimensions of our toppers is 38 '' x74 '' . we design our toppers to be smaller than the actually mattress dimensions , to avoid sticking out of the edges . 
not sure what you mean about `` real , '' but the mattress is definately cooling . my wife and i have bought several of this type of mattress 's and this is by far the best one we have bought ! 
6 x 18 x 27 - this is the queen size . hope this helps you . 
they certainly are not flat . i would say about they are about 6 inches thick . and you could bunch it up and make it higher , i would think . i will say i bought one for all my children and their spouses because my husband and i loved our 's so much . great night sleep without fighting the darn pillow . hope this helps you . 
i got mine from a reputable warehouse . i do n't think the one i got is a knock off . nice pillow but not for the price i pay . 
i have not tried . let me check . no i can not . mine has the cover to it and then the actual pillow . i hope this helps . 
just one , but it is worth every penny ! ! ! best pillow i have ever owned ! ! 
i do n't know - there were n't any in min e 
mine did not wash well , it has big flat areas in it and i am very disappointed in this pillow . 
it will dissipate after some time . i let mine sit outside for a day in fresh air . the odor will fade . 
yes i do ! this is the best pillow ever 
queen 
i 'm not sure if it is required but i do . 
i never have washed it . 
large is 9x11 medium is 8.5x11 small is 8x6 
do n't put in the dishwasher - the more delicate you handle it the longer it 'll last . wash with soap and water , dry immediately and it will stay in great condition ! 
large is 9x11 medium is 8.5x11 small is 8x6 
large is 9x11 medium is 8.5x11 small is 8x6 
yes ! it is made in the usa 
buy yourself a good set of cast iron cookware . lodge makes the best . use `` ringer '' to clean it . after dinner , wait until the pan is warm enough to touch and add a little water . remember , cast iron holds heat very well , -- you may have to wait until morning . okay . if you do it in the morning , add a little water , put the pan on the stove , and heat it until the pan is warm enough to touch , just like last night . remove the pan from any heat and use the ringer ( scrunched up in your hand ) to scrub out the cast iron . remember -- no soap ! just scrub it out with the ringer . you might have to go over some of the more tenacious bits , but just do it . this tool does the job and does n't ruin your precious cast iron by removing the seasoning like soap would do . 
no it wo n't rust and no oiling needed i would n't use it on enamel cast iron it may leave marks on it 
i 'm not sure about the white marks but i looked up the part about `` whitish or grey spots '' and they might be mineral ( calcium ) stains . i read some answers from using some lemon juice on the stains and or a bit of dish soap and scrubbing the spots . here is the link to the site i found . hope it helps : http : cooking.stackexchange.com questions 35629 white-stains-and-stainless-steel-cookware 
i have both a grill pan and have used this ringer on it . i have found it easier to just use your finger on a single layer of the ringer between the bars than trying to ball it up and scrub . although you can do that too . i ca n't comment on the finer mesh as i do n't own one . 
they must be welded although i ca n't see any weld marks because you can not pull it apart . do n't know for sure but this little piece of mesh is a wonder . kind of pricey , i thought , but sure glad i cracked and bought it because it does the trick . 
it 's been working great on mine . i 've been using it on my cast , stainless and even my high carbon steel flat bottom wok ( helped clean the ridges where food would stick ) all with great results 
as far as i can tell it should work well with any type of cast iron cooking grate . you bunch it up in your hand and use it like a scouring pad . since it is meant to be used on all cast iron cookware it should work well . the only caveat is that it does not cover a large area like a grill so you would have to do an area at a time . 
beautifully and very easy 
it works great . i use it on my stainless steel ( and even pyrex occasionally ) , in addition to my cast iron . just fyi ... it has done a remarkable job on my cast iron wok , getting rid of the gritty stuff and leaving it with a lovely seasoned finish . 
height : 5 1 8 '' inside to lip ; 7 '' to top of plunger assembly . i would not use the teapot in the microwave to heat the water to brewing temp as i am not sure how it would react . 
it is plastic ! 
yes , the press can be completely removed . 
not sure i can provide a precise answer , but the boxes are pretty enormous . with a little ingenuity , i 'd wager you could fit at least a dozen , and possibly up to 20 , adult-sized sweaters in one of the boxes . 
they are if they are all the way filled . if not , and they have a decent amount if weight in them the tops sink im 
no , there was really no smell at all . 
hello , thanks for your question . according to the information available in the product description section of the product page , the dimensions of the box are 12 '' wide , 15.7 '' long , and 10 '' high . i hope this is helpful ! 
correct , 10 inches high . 
they are a synthetic fabric with a linen texture . there is cardboard stiffener between the outside fabric and the inside lining . 
8 and 1 4 inches 
no they are not serrated , but they do have a cutting edge . be aware however , that the knives are less than 18 10. overall we like the set . handles are large and large forks do not fit in the individual tableware holders in the dishwasher . 
the stamp on the knives says `` stainless '' `` handles 18 10 '' so i do n't know about the blades , but never have had any problems or issues with them and have owned them for 10+ years . i do n't use harsh cleaners ( e.g. , powders ) or non-gentle scrubbing pads . hope this helps . 
no royce , it is made in vietnam . 
its a beautiful high polished finish . its also ( in my opinion ) much more refined in the definition features detailing each piece . crisp and clean around each detailed feature . a and b waterford with another manufacturer to witness the difference . 
same question i have , you 'd think they 'd put a picture of it . hot plastic is something i avoid when possible . 
the thermos is 9 and 5 8 inches tall and 2 and 3 4 inches in diameter . it works well . 
i 've washed ours in the dishwasher several times and have had no problems with it . so i 'd say yes . 
yes . 9 and 1 2 inches circum or 2 and 2 3 inches across bottom . almost 10 inches high , including cup . 
it does n't , i returned the one i purchased . 
mine works beautifully and has since day one . perhaps you are using a weaker blend of coffee it 's self or are using a choice of cup too large for your particular brand of coffee . i find some of the breakfast blends are a weaker coffee flavor . use a smaller cup choice when you brew . if that does n't work may i suggest that you have gotten a coffee maker that just does n't work properly . even the best of man made products are not always perfect ; i think they call them lemons , but that does not make them all lemons . send it back and try another one , kuerig is a very fair company and i am sure they will work with you . hope this helps . 
it is just over 8 '' from counter to the top of the tallest cup you can use . the machine has a removable 2 '' drip tray , but if you do n't use the tray you could easily get an 8 '' cup under the spout . if you leave the drip tray in , your max cup height would be 6 '' . the tray easily removes and goes back into place in a millisecond . it does catch the occasional drip and holds about 8 oz fluid for those times when you are really in a hurry and forget to put any size cup under it ! however , without it you just want to keep a napkin or paper towel handy for the occasional small drip . 
yes 
this uses keurig 05073 size filters . i have been using generic replacements for the keurig filters , and they work fine . 
it 's the platinum k75 that comes with a 72 oz reservoir ! 
i decided on the k75 platinum due to the size of the water reservoir being so large , hence not needing to fill as often , the fact that you can set the k75 to turn off and then back on to heat the water in time for your needed cup . i do n't like having the power on all the time so this feature is awesome . this package deal also came with the charcoal filter and a refillable , removable coffee filter so you can use your own coffee as well as a large selection of the kcups so we could decide which type brand of coffee we liked . we found we have entirely different tastes in our coffee . love , love , love our k75 platinum ! hope this helped as i really did n't look that much further at the b70 after finding the k75 . 
yes it will make ice tea . fill a glass that will fit under the brewer with ice and brew a kcup of tea . you may want to use a plastic tumbler as the glass may shatter . 
yes . do n't use a k-cup , select your cup size , and press `` brew . '' 
sure . just do n't put a k-cup in the brewer , select your cup size and press `` brew . '' 
about 2minutes 
one charge per use . the instruction manual says you can use two cartridges to make a bottle extra fizzy , but i have n't needed to do that- plenty of carbonation with one cartridge . if you buy them in boxes of 20 or more , they only cost about 50 cents each ... 
yes i am currently using them 
it is n't terribly loud - i 've had a soda stream ( well , still have it only its at my vaca home across the country ) . the only loud part is when you have to release the pressure . you push a button and a 2 second `` hiss '' occurs which may scare your dog . i bought this item after reading an independent review of all home soda makers ; this one was the most impressive . i have two main comments on mastrad vs. sodastream : sodastream is vastly more costly , but mastrad 's soda has a distinct metallic taste i believe from the gas contained in the metal chargers . i purchsed the mrfizz seltzer chargers as they were the least expensive . perhaps others would n't produce that taste ? i doubt this would be true as they are all pretty similar . however , the taste has n't prevented me from drinking it or ordering more . the mastrad is n't as `` easy '' to use , theres more steps involved ... soda stream does have that process down pretty darn well . what is odd is this mastrad was reviewed as having the `` best tasting selzter '' . i know this is a lot more information than you requested , but i figured i 'd offer it since i could . hope this helps . 
we 've had ours 6 plus months . no sign of rust . it 's stainless steel . not sure how it would rust . 
the first time i used the mastrad it distorted the seal & gas escaped . i discovered that i had n't screwed the cap on all the way . the seal should not be visible when it is tightened & actually continues to rotate 1-2 more times before it is truly sealed . then before i put the cartridge on i press the release valve in go make sure it is not stuck . make sure not to cross thread the cartridge holder . after gassing i leave the cartridge in place , shake the canister & put it in the fridge for several hours . when ready do n't try to open it until you press the pressure release valve until no more gas escapes . then open the lid & replace it with the storage cap . if this does n't help then i suggest you contact mastrad . oh yeah , use the white funnel provided to fill & only fill until the liquid touches the bottom of the funnel . 
it is stainless steel on the inside and out . karen eurostoves 
i have done that and it does retain a good amount of its carbonation . mind you it 's not going to be as carbonated as it was at first but it 's still pretty good . i also kept mine in the refrigerator for the time being which will help it remain carbonated . 
no it does not come with cartridges . the cartridge holder has long threads which i expect accommodate any standard 8 gram cartridge , though i have only used leylands . the leyland cartridges on amazon are by far the cheapest i have found , esp . when bought in bulk . 
not normal . use a flashlight and check for rust . return to amazon if you are within the date to do so ; otherwise you will have a difficult time to get a refund from mastrad , if any . 
i have been trouble by the rust as well ... . i have had mine for about 6 months too , and use it constantly ... . any ideas would be helpful because i love this thing ! ! ! ! 
i would think so . they would hold a lot of small mints . it just depends on how you plan to use them . i was having a `` de stress '' party , and had two kinds of chili , plus slaw on the side . i put the slaw in the mini cube . they were perfect for a small serving and it looked nice too . 
they would work if the berries are on the small side . 
these mini cups are made from a very durable plastic . however , it would be good to allow your cobbler to cool down some before adding to the dessert cups . 
the measurement is one square inch 
i arranged them on a platter and then plastic wrapped them good and tight over the whole thing . 
i dont think i would ! ! they are great for cold . 
the funnel down to a smaller square base . t 
these are 2 '' wide and 1.75 '' tall . we used them with a bit of salsa and shrimp in individual servings on a platter - perfect ! 
yes , but i would cool the pudding down a little before pouring . it is a sturdy plastic . i made panna cotta in it and it was a perfect party serving size for tasting . 
i have used them a few times . i would not put them in the dishwasher . i had 2-3 of them crack after one usage but most would be great to use over and over . the plastic is fairly thin but good for our usage . i would purchase these again without hesitation . 
no , unless you actually pay for the frame under the options . that frame you see is just part of the picture . 
drawing in this poster is a view from rockefeller center i guess . glass front also a drawing . 
that the artwork is mounted to foamboard or other rigid medium like cardstock 
i had n't thought about it , but now that you mention it , i 'm pretty sure that the answer would be yes . what a great idea . i 'm ca n't see any reason that that would n't work . 
yes this comes in a box . 
seems to be a high grade heat resistant silicon . 
greetings , thank you for your email . we have not tried this with eggbeaters , but it is certainly a good idea for you to try . best regards , begum9 
i use medium sized eggs ( 2.5 '' ) . 
hello , thank you for your question . as of today december 20 , 2013 this item is sold by sellers . some sellers choose to ship internationally and some do not . the easiest way to check if the item can be shipped to your location would be to add it to your cart and then click the `` proceed to checkout '' button . an error message will appear if it is not able to be delivered to your destination . if you are able to proceed through the order process and giving shipping methods prices to chose from then this means that a seller of the item is able to ship to your location . this item is made out of silicone rubber . i hope this helps ! 
i would n't attempt to to anything that is not the consistency of cooked potatoes . i suggest a meat grinder for meat and poultry . 
the square discs ( 2 sizes included ) make up the bottom.this the only place where the food comesut . 
my kids and i love this potato ricer . yes , the disk plate was locked by the collar and it did n't moved . i made a very sticky and the stuff came out just fine . i have owned this tools for about nine months and i do n't feel any regret at all . if u do n't have one , you should get one for yourself . 
1 cup or 2 med potatoes 
i 've been totally happy with this potato ricer so far . used it a lot to make potato salad this summer . 
no 
yes 
i prefer the larger holed mesh . 
the best i can tell they are identical 
i have n't tried it myself , but i do n't see why not . it has to plates with different size holes and you control the pressure . 
wish there was and a dust ruffle , not to mention post sheers . 
no hardware needed . it has holes on each corner where you just slide over the poles . 
it 's simply a slip cover . i already had the frame . 
i have my old canopy bef from when i was a child ( about 30 years ago ) . it looks pretty similar to the bed in the advertisement picture but is wooden painted white . 
it would look a bit better on a canopy bed with an arch . ours did n't come with one and it still looks nice but a little saggy . i think it would work for most canopy beds . it has holes on each corner so you just slip it on . super easy . 
no , you can not put under the broiler . in fact , you should n't use in an oven above 400 degrees . another tip ... do n't use pam or other sprays . 
china i believe 
the larger one is about the size of a standard cookie sheet , i do n't know what size your microwave is but it could easily be cut 
thanks for the tip denise . the baking mat sizes are in the main bullet points at the top of the page , and the product description section further down . we are glad that people still take the time to ask if they can not find the information they need , and are only too happy to help . 
hi midge , happy to help . there are 2 x baking mats in the set . the larger of the 2 is the half-sheet size ( 16.5 '' x 11 5 8 '' ) , the smaller one is 11.5 '' x 8.5 '' . i hope this helps ! any more questions feel free to ask . 
the silicone baking mats ( x 2 ) * 1 x large half sheet size : 16.5 '' x 11 5 8 '' * 1 x smaller size : 11.5 '' x 8.5 '' 
hi there , the size of the mats are : * 1 x large half sheet size : 16.5 '' x 11 5 8 '' * 1 x smaller quarter sheet size : 11.5 '' x 8.5 '' this information is included in the product description section of the page . hope this helps ! 
hi ahmed , yes this set is perfect for those types of recipes . the silicone mats are heat resistant and non stick so your caramels and toffe will lift right off them . the spatulas are also non stick and heat resistant so perfect for working with these types of foods . i hope this answer helps ! regards , matt - starpack team 
hello , the orange knife is a paring knife and is 3.5 '' & with the blade cover 8 '' ; the yellow knife is a utility knife & is 6.5 '' & with blade cover 11 '' ; the green knife is a santoku knife which is 7 '' & with blade cover 12 '' ; the red knife is a bread knife ( the only knife that cuts my homemade bread without tearing it apart ) is 8 '' & with blade is 12.5 '' ; the blue knife is a slicing knife & is 8 '' and with blade cover 13 '' ; the purple knife is a chef knife & is 8 '' with blade cover 13 '' . i hope this helps . 
i believe they are counting the blade guards as 6 of the 12 pieces . a bit misleading . 
unfortunately , yes the color does scratch off easily and the silver stainless steel shows through . 
i have washed mine several times in the dishwasher . there 's no rust on the exposed metal edges and the paint coating has stayed on the blades just fine . the plastic handles also appear unaffected by the dishwasher . 
no it does not come with a knife block . 
it depends on how strong your magnetic strip is . i bought my strip on ebay . it 's made of oak & has very strong magnets . these knives stick fine with the blade guards on . 
luckily my mom have one of those cutting board . no problem at all . they still sharp . dont know if she uses this board every day , but as she told me they work just fine . 
hard , but are great ! 
no , there is n't but there should be ! nevertheless , these knives all come with matching sheaths , so they can easily go into a `` knife drawer '' and not cause any cuts to the hands . 
it depends on how strong your magnetic strip is . i bought my strip on ebay . it 's made of oak & has very strong magnets . these knives stick fine with the blade guards on . 
there are two types of canning : boiling-water canning at 100c 212f ( for acid fruits , tomatoes , pickles and jellied products ) and pressure canning at 115~121c 240~250f ( for low acid vegetables , meat and poultry ) . please refer to `` usda complete guide to home canning '' for more details . instant pot can be used for boiling-water canning . however , instant pot has not been tested for food safety in pressure canning by usda . due to the fact that programs in instant pot ip-csg , ip-lux and ip-duo series are regulated by a pressure sensor instead of a thermometer , the elevation of your location may affect the actual cooking temperature . for now , we would n't recommend using instant pot for pressure canning purpose . please note this correction to our early inaccurate information . 
instant pot ip-duo has dual pressure settings : high 10.2 ~ 11.6psi ( 70 ~ 80kpa ) ; low 5.8 ~7.2 psi ( 40 ~ 50kpa ) 
instant pot ip-duo has two temperatures for making yogurt : 36 ~ 43c ( 96.8 ~ 109.4f ) ; and 30 ~ 34c ( 86 ~ 93.2f ) . it can be program to run 99 hours 30 minutes . if your starter works in these two temperature ranges , instant pot ip-duo can be used to make yogurt with any alternative milks . 
i usually cook black beans , pinto beans or lentils . i soak over night and cook for 15 minutes on high pressure with natural cool down . come out perfectly for me . soft , but not mushy . 
yes , you can cook from frozen with all our instant pot pressure cookers . the cooking time is the same but the `` pre-heat '' time will just be longer . regards , instant pot 
the pot is manufactured in china . the company is located on ottawa , canada . 
you can always cook frozen meat . i frequently have put frozen hamburger in a skillet simultaneously friying it and thawing it out right there in the pan constantly scraping off the outer layer as it cooks and defrosts at the same time . you can do this in the instant pot on the saute setting . in any pressure cooker ( the instant pot is primarily used as a pressure cooker ) you can put a whole frozen chicken , stew meat , frozen chiie block with two inches of water , making beef stew or chicken soup and just cook it about 5 minutes longer in the pressure cooker than unfrozen meat . it works very well . a pressure cooker unthaws frozen meat rather quickly as it cooks at about 240 degrees . no need to defrost first . you can take the meat put in the morning , put it in a dish in the morning and it will bee defrosted when you get home from work , but that is not necessary . just take it out of the freezer and throw it in the pressure cooker . it will cook just the same as unfrozen , just give it a few extra minutes bottom line - frozen is no big deal . w.o . 
you could probably do this using the `` saute '' feature . 
as the owner of many a rice cooker over the years , i find that there is a learning curve on white rice in the instant pot duo ... .i use the manual setting and use a bain marie rather than the rice setting . i think you will find the rice a tad moister than in the rice cooker ... ... that being said , the convenience and time saving of the instant pot has relegated my rice cooker to a storage cabinet . just letting you know that you will have to experiment with the water levels to get the perfect texture you want . a good place to start is hip pressure cooking the bain marie rice method http : www.hippressurecooking.com easy-pressure-cooker-steamed-rice 
if cooking anything that will foam up easily , do not fill the pot more than 1 2 way . to clean the lid , remove the silicone seal and the steam vent cap located inside of the lid , soak in lemon scented dish washing liquid over night then rinse well with water . 
brushed metal . 
the two bottom cabinets are each 15.5 '' deep , 16 '' tall and 19.5 '' wide . there are adjustable shelves that you can opt to put in them . the drawers are 17.5 '' wide , 12.5 '' deep and about 3 3 8 '' tall . 
the height behind the doors is 15 1 2 '' tall and the shelf on the right can be left out . 
its very sturdy but do n't think that would work..might tip over 
the back is thick cardboard . the front side ( the side that you will see if you open drawers and in the exposed spaces ) is `` finished '' - it matches the color of the unit . the back side of the cardboard is not . 
43 7 8 '' wide , 18 1 8 '' deep , 41 5 8 '' tall 
parts are veneer and parts are engineer wood 
no , this particular style only comes in this color . 
omigosh hours of assembly with at least a few broken pieces ! 
the entire cabinet is 41 5 8 '' tall and the shelve area in the middle are 16 1 2 '' tall . 
when the top is extended , it is 24 3 4 '' in height . 
walmart.com has more pictures 
it is a black but more with a little bit of a wood grain . not a matte black finish nor is it shiny . 
when fully extended , the lift top of the table is 24 '' from the floor . there are no other adjustable heights other than closed ( 19 '' ) and open ( 24 '' ) , nor is there an easy way to adjust without replacing the locking cantilever hinges ( included ) . 
they are 16 '' deep , 10 1 2 '' wide , 8 1 2 '' high . the middle opening is just over 13 '' wide , with the other dimensions the same . 
you will need two hands more than likely to open this . it has some resistance . its not really hard to open though . 
it 's very sturdy , it was able to support a 28 inch computer monitor and a few books without issues . 
no not wide enough 
the actual dimensions for storage are slightly less than the table top 
no , it does not have wheels . 
we actually carry two . one , this one , has the ceramic insert and it is removable and it is glazed . this is the 7600. the white you see is the glazed insert . the other one is 8 quart and is non glazed and in the picture you can see the clay color on that one . that insert is also removable but it is a more sophisticated looking machine with push buttons instead of a knob to set the temp . 
since on high it will actually come to a very slow boil i 'd say yes 
yes if you have it on the yogurt setting . it may be a few degrees higher than 110 though 
i have only used it for yogurt , but i think it would be great for oatmeal too . 
212f 
we can get them as a special order item but do not stock them . to arrange for that you would have to contact us direct . 
it is unglazed by design . it is naturally non-stick . 
i just follow the instructions . jerry 
it is made with organic lead and chemical free clay . 
110f for yogurt . 
i would be reluctant to use any heated item for infants or young children due to the risk of overheating and their inability to communicate such . i would encourage you to speak with your pediatrician to be certain . 
no thread count listed on tags attached to the mattress pad . i was not concerned about thread count since a sheet goes over the pad . 
there is only the standard 110 plug 
thanks for asking me..i keep it plugged in all year round and it only turns on when you push the button . it will stay on i believe for like 8-10 ( i think 10 ) hours until you push the button in again that turns the light ( on the button ) off . i love love this item ... i know you will too . 
yes 
i do n't really know for sure but i do n't see why it could n't be used on an adjustable bed . 
not to my knowledge . it just has 2 controls for each half . 
we have been useing one on sleep number bed for over 5 years and that just a big air mattres so i would say yes you can 
i have n't washed mine yet , but the instructions say yes it 's washable . i have a duvet cover on mine and it 's great . 
yes 
yes 
it says in the manual there is an auto off setting that you can set ... .i always turn mine off when i get in bed ... i just want to crawl into a warm bed . 
i do n't know if it will work ... it probably will ruin the electronics ... try a waterproof mattress pad on top or look for one that is waterproof..i saw one somewhere 
we bought the mattress pad for our guest futon which was only in use over xmas . as i recall the connector was near the top edge of the mattress but not intruding on the top surface . hope this is of use . p.s . the guests did n't complain ! 
yes , it is shaped like a fitted sheet , and it stays on real well ! 
i ordered a queen and it has dual controls . i ordered this brand specifically for that reason . i really only use one side cause it heats so well and i like to lay in the middle of my bed to have a half warm and half cool side . i 'm cold one minute and hot the next ! haha i 'm not sure about the full size pads ? i did n't look into that . 
machine wash cool water ... on delicate . hang to dry . i put mine in dryer on med for 10 minutes then hang.. do not hand over a line so wires are not bent . i spread mine over rails on my deck . 
i 've had mine since april and think they are great . although they are white , i 've had no issue with staining , which was something that concerned me when i first got them . i also have n't had any issues with scratching , but i 'm very careful not to use metal utensils with them , and i do n't stack them directly on top of each other . i just put thin towels between them for storage . overall , i 'm very pleased with this set and would recommend purchasing them . 
yes very tight fit.will fit multiple.hope you enjoy them . 
it 's definitely darker than tomato soup , but i think it 's a little lighter than fire engine red . it 's a really nice , rich color . 
the long answer : the paint has chipped already . i use dobie sponges . idk if that 's what 's causing it . or if it 's just an indication of the quality of the pots and pans . but for $ 60 bucks i ca n't complain . the short answer : i have n't tried it and i would n't recommend it . 
no magnets do not stick to aluminum . the bottom is aluminum . we absolutely love these pans ! 
wood or plastic utensils 
these remind me of the green pans . i was on a 500 calorie diet that recommended these pans because you need no butter or oil . eggs slide right out . loving them , best investment . 
bottoms are unpainted ... so no worries ! 
tried to upload a picture here of 1 of my lime green pots 
unfortunately in china 
pans are fully lined inside with ceramic , and have a spiral aluminum bottom when you turn them upside down . the outer sides are a lovely green color . 
as copied from product description on the product page on amazon.com : product description what 's in box : 10 piece cookware set includes : covered dutch oven 5-quart , covered casserole 3 quart , covered sauce pan 1 quart , covered sauce pan 2 quart , fry pan 8 inch , fry pan 9.5 inch fry pan . nonstick ceramic coating is ptfe-free , pfoa-free , cadmium and lead free , compare to traditional nonstick coating system , ceramic coating provide superior non-stick performance with resistant to scratch . cookware use thick gauge aluminum provide super heat conductive without any hot-spot in bottom , anti-slip coating on handle provide a soft feeling when touch handle , make it comfortable and stay cool during cooking . 
the cookware is made of aluminum . induction cooking appliances like the `` nuwave cooktop '' require the cookware to be made of cast iron or stainless steel material in order to work however , there are interface disks that will work with aluminum cookware in order to use a induction cooking appliances . google `` induction cooking with aluminum cookware '' . i hope i have helped . have a good day . 
well i myself have only had this product for alittle while , but i can tell you its beautiful and cooks nicely , and i am looking forward to it lasting a very very long time . 
it is white and smoothe inside . it does not have the dark teflon that we are use to . it says nonstick ceramic coating is ptfe-free , pfoa-free , cadmium and lead free , compare to traditional nonstick coating system . not sure what that all means but hopefully that will help you determine if it is . but is is not your normal teflon looking pan . 
i have cooked both in my pots without any stains . they still look knew 
it you choose prime it takes 2 days . i got my set quite a while ago , before it was prime , i think and even then it took just 3 days or so to get it . 
no , these pans are not anodized , they have ceramic interiors . i gave my daughter a set for christmas and she says that they are the best pans she has ever owned ! and she has gone through a lot of pan sets over the years . 
i have a glass stovetop and they work great . they have an inlay of metal on the bottom to assist in heating . 
we are very sorry to inform you that we do not sell it separately . 
no , but you will like it because it is thick . the curtain goes outside the tub , the liner , inside , that keeps all the suds and water within the tub and its well made . wayne 
it can be used as decorative shower curtain for simple styles modern bathroom or protective liner for your fabric or cotton shower curtains . it is light color..wo n't affect your own decorative curtains ! ! 
it is using pvc free material . lw-07 is 100 % eva . no bad smell and health concerns . 
it is plastic , it will melt if you use an iron . however , mine was not wrinkled . 
it 's plastic , not fabric . better off hosing it down if necessary . 
few months . 
lw-07 is just a single layer shower curtain or liner . it can be used as a waterproof shower curtain liner inside the tub with a fabric or cotton decorative shower curtain outside . if you do not have a decorative shower curtain , this floral white shower curtain also looks great in your bathroom . it provides flexible bathroom decoration ideas for you . 
this lw-07 shower curtain does not have magnets at the bottom . it works well with other decorative shower curtain outside . and it is not easy to flow away because it is heavier than most thin shower curtain liners . 
it is made with 100 % eva , a chlorine-free and child-safe material . it is a target supplier in china . 
lw-07 shower curtain is not heavy duty shower curtain or liner ( around 1.0 pound ) . but it is heavier and thicker than most other vinyl shower curtain liners . it is good for bathroom with cotton shower curtains . you also can use it as an independent shower curtain . because it is a beautiful eva shower curtain with white floral pattern . 
i wash mine in the dishwasher all the time with no sign of rust whatsoever - very unlike the old tin flour sifter it replaced . 
i just looked on my product but i do n't see a `` made in '' imprint anywhere . unfortunately i do n't still have the box . i will say it is well made , not like a cheap china product . the only issue i have is the same that everyone else seems to have- the black handle will unscrew . i think if i just superglue the screw that it will be ok. but it 's expected since it is a crank . if it helps , my mother who is a baker always asks to use my sifter because she says it reminds her of my grandmother 's . i would buy again 
i have never seen a sifter that sifts twice , but my guess is no . however , it has 4 blades instead of 2 like my last really cheap one did . hope this helps . 
the diameter is 6 inches & the height is about 6 3 4 inches . 
im not sure but they are not thin and cheap feeling . i am very very happy with these . i really like that they have lids , and love the small ones for dips and sauces . hope this helps 
i 've had this set ( actually bought 2 sets ) for about a year . i found the lids to be well constructed and not thin and flimsy . the lids fit inside the bowls rather than overlap the bowls if that makes any sense so no chance of pulling cracking even if they were thin lids which they are not ... .i 'm really very happy with both my sets ... highly recommends 
yes my bowls are indeed the noted sizes . 
i have n't ever had this issue with mine . are you sure they 're coming from the bowls ? do you use them in a mixer ? 
yes ! they work perfectly ! 
i really had n't considered using them for oven so unfortunately i ca n't answer your question . i 've only used them ( and many times in a short time ! ) for refrigerated items ( salads etc ) but i really love them ! 
i 'm not sure . i bought this as a christmas gift for my sister . sorry i could n't help . 
you do want a coarse grind for a french press coffee maker . the key is letting the coffee steep long enough to make a strong brew . we recommend grounding your beans right before you brew your first pot . our customers have had the best results using a hand grinder like this one : http : www.amazon.com dp b00pvvkh42 as a general rule , if you are at a higher altitude , then you need to add time because boiling water is cooler . i have good results with a 5 minute steep time . ( note that i am at 5000ft , so 5 minutes may be too long for you , at a normal altitude try closer to 4 minutes ) be sure to use a timer , and compare different times to find the optimal brew . you can make good tasting coffee with finer grounds , but they may clog the filter , or if they are too fine , they might pass through it altogether , giving you a rather gritty pot of coffee . 
the screen is stainless or it would have rusted by now . the part on the strainer looks to be stainless . the rod part is hard to tell maybe a different quality of stainless then the other parts ? i do n't think there is any aluminum in it . is it just me or does `` mike robison '' sound like he is pitching this product ? it 's as easy to clean as any other french press that i have used anywhere in the world . what qualifies any of these people besides the manufacture to state the materials it is made of ? the description does say all stainless steel , borosilicate glass , and strong bpa free plastic . 
is your carafe the kona french press carafe ? i can assure you , it is glass . if you have something other than this particular french press , i can not answer your question without seeing the actual product . this french press is glass . 
yes the coffee press will with stand boiling water . however , it 's generally better to add the water just after it stops boiling , wait about a minute before adding it , water should not be actively boiling when you pour it in one of these so as not to burn or even destroy the beneficial constituents . hope this helps , ~team idylc homes 
let the carafe cool first ; otherwise , the metal parts are very hot to touch . after you remove the press from the carafe , clasp on to the bottom metal piece of the rod ( opposite end from the black knob ) with your right hand while spinning the plunger disk to its left or away from yourself . if the metal is too small or slippery to grasp , try using a rubber dish-washing glove or something similar to get a good grip . do n't hold & unscrew from the rubber knob . here is a short video of my demonstration 
yes , absolutely ... here is how we recommend brewing hot tea as a tea press . ~ clean off coffee residues from mesh filter , if significant amount consider a vinegar & water mixture . ~ prepare amount of water needed for the cups of tea going to be poured as soon as the first steep of tea is complete . ~ add 1 teaspoon of your favorite tea leaf per 8 ounces of water used . if stronger flavor is desired , add more tea , not time . ~ lower plunger halfway to bottom . the idea is not to compress but to use the plunger as a sieve . compressing tea leaves may produce bitter results . ~ pour off all tea . do n't leave any tea steeping in water for an extended period of time . ~ re-steep tea leaves as many times as you find they produce a tasty cup . ~ for more information about how to steep your favorite teas check out our tea chart here & gt ; & gt ; http : ecx.images-amazon.com images i 81vvq1gtr8l._sl1500_.jpg hope this helps , team idylc homes 
its not insulated at all . it will only stay hot for about the same amount of time it would in a regular coffee cup . 
joanna , if you 're taking it to work for brewing coffee there with a `` very '' hot water source in a safe-from-scalding location , fine . if you 're considering using the kona press as a travel mug , no-no-no ! it is not a travel mug . imagine taking your mr. coffee 12 cup karafe full of scalding coffee on a commute to work in your vehicle . the design looks like a mug but it is only for brewing-serving . the instructions give detailed `` no-no 's '' for safe handling . one important tip is to use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir the grounds a bit after pouring the first 2-3 inches to break up any caking . the special heat-resistant glass can crack using a metal utensil when super heated by boiling water . i have a steel travel 16 oz mug with a secure vented lid . despite these handling steps , i am very happy with this model french press . easy disassembly , cleaning , eco-friendly `` just coffee '' without filters or rip-off miniserving plastic containers from a steampunk nightmarish expensive gimmick , and using less counter space make all the difference . now i feel connected to a more traditional and sensible sipping community while whispering , `` machines ! i do n't need no stinking machines ! '' : - ) 
you need room for the coffee and the press filter , so 3.5 cups is what i usually get . you get 3 `` clean '' 8oz cups- after that it can get a bit `` muddy '' depending on your grind ( coarse is better ) , how long you let it settle ( patience grasshopper ) and if you pour it all out slowly at one go ( going back to the upright position between pours muddies it ) . the press is 34 oz . so therefore , roughly between 3 to 4 cups . 
this is a trick question lol . you need to use `` coarse coffee grinds '' however i used maxwell house fine ground beans . the only down fall is i may of used to much because some parts where a dark brown color . i would suggest grinding the coffee coarse like there directions say ( after you buy it has directions on box ) 
i have not tried to match it yet because i got grey sheets to go with it , but there are actually two different yellows on the comforter and the pillow shams . one is light and the other a more goldenrod color . those are the colors of the stiching . then the base yellow of the pillows and the shams is another yellow in between those two . i 'm guessing with the three yellows it should n't be to hard to match . love this set ! highly recommended ! 
i bought this for my mother who takes care of her things perfectly . it has not been through the wash yet and ironically she called me yesterday to tell me that it is pulling apart inside . the stuffing is already pulling apart from the cover . she has no children or animals . it does n't seem to be made well . it 's attractive , but hers is apparently not going to stand up to a wash cycle . 
perfect medium grey ! not too light and not too dark . love this bed set . 
bed skirt , comforter,2 regular sized pillow shams , 2 square pillow shams , 1 square throw pillow and 1 oblong throw pillow 
it does not have pink at all and we are 100 % satisfied ! 
just the one main area 
it is the name of the pattern - there is no pink in it 
the color of the finish is select cherry which is a darker somewhat red finish with some brown in it . the are three adjustments for the 2 shelves behind the glass doors . there is one adjustable shelf behind the middel door also . 
yes but i would not buy it again ... . mine is a piece of garbage that is coming apart i have contacted sauder and they try to send me different replacement parts but really who wants to take it apart and flip it over and put in extra parts that it 's really just a bad made piece of furniture . the side wood pushes out and the shelves come apart and i 've never moved it and treat it like gold ... try to find something else so you do n't waste the money 
yes it does . 
sauder products have a laminated finish . this one is called salt oak which is a kind of a gray , weathered look similar to a `` barn siding '' finish . 
the width is 21 '' , the depth is 19.25 '' and the height is 18.5 '' . 
yes . i have 55 '' on mine with about 4 '' left on each side . 
yes , at least parts of it . but we are pleased with the look of it . 
it is like 50 pounds at least 
yes you do have to assemble 
it will accomodate a 60 '' flat screen weighing 135lbs or less . 
the quality is excellent i have a 55 '' lg smart tv with a lg dvd blue ray player under the tv on 1 side and there is no bowing on this and if everthing goes well by next year i will have a 70 '' lg tv sitting on it . this is solid i could probably lay on it the top and it would not bow . thanks zane 
the evo sprayer was terrific the first use . after that it consistently sprayed two jets at about a 90 degree angle , one jet for the food and one jet for the wall . the only time it sprays as advertised is when you use it to spray warm , soapy water in an attempt to clean it . i contacted the manufacturer several times about the problem and have gotten no response . do n't waste your money . 
the description says usa 
yes included ! 
i use canola as a pam substitute all the time ! works great and without all the chemicals . 
measures 9 '' tall x 5.5 '' wide . 
i dont know much about 'smoking meat ' . i looked up this site http : www.the-grilling-spot.com smoking-meat.html to give me some in site . i do n't read much for spraying the meat during , only as before its smoked . so if that is what you are asking.. unsure . if your wanting to know if it is a great sprayer for grills..i believe it would be great for coverage . i love mine ! it has a nice wide spray that is more than a fine mist , it is not over heavy . i barely use a full spray to oil a 12 inch pan . hope i helped some . 
i 've never used the presto but light spraying on my husbands popcorn works fine with the evo oil sprayer . 
the way it sprays does n't work for misting ... i 've tried . 
probably unless whatever you are using to infuse clogs up the tube . 
mine is imprinted `` delta industries , king of prussia , pa '' on the bottom of the bottle . 
no it ca n't be used as a single tier . the locking mechanism is what 's keeps things from leaking . the first part of the box has a lid that feels tight but can open inside your bag pretty easily . and yes it can hold a small bagel or burger 
no . it is metal interior and plastic exterior 
each compartment holds about 10 oz each , with some room left for the lid . 
probably not , the 'metal ' inside is more of a metallic paint that scrapes off and the outside is plastic . 
no it does n't : ( 
good 
dontk now never tried 
hi kamlyn ! i 've had soup stay really hot for 3 hours , and nicely hot for 5 hrs . ( indoors ) i have n't used it for picnics or camping , so i do n't know how well it insulates when it 's used outside . hope this helps ! 
unfortunatley , i do not recall . however i can tell you that it is poorly made . i bought if for my 1o year old son . he is pretty good about not breaking things , but the the plastic handles are really poorly designed and broke within 2 weeks . if it is for an adult , it might last longer . 
it 's about 6 inches tall when stacked and about 6 inches in diameter . 
both have to be used to close correctly 
i 'm sorry unfortunately it is not 
i never tried to use it for that purpose . only used it for my son 's school lunch 's . 
yes , same size . 
stacked , the container is a little under 6 '' high . the two bowls have a diameter of about 5 '' . it has worked fairly well for my son 's ( 13 yrs ) lunches , but i 've had to wrap his sandwiches in cellophane or aluminum foil so that the rest of the compartment can hold something else . 
i have n't tried but i 'm scared of carcinogens in plastic so i never heat plastic stuff 
not on these . they are coated in plastic . i have these lunch boxes and love them but would never think to use them on my induction top . 
no . it is just the comforter . you have to purchase the sheets separately but they are nice sheets ! 
no , it does n't . : - ( 
no , they know its out of stock and hard to get right now , so they increased the price extremely ! ridiculous 
yes it actually fits a full size bed . my daughter has a full size and that is what we use it for . it only comes with the comforter and one pillow case . 
the print on the fitted sheet is a silhouette of anna . the blanket print is flowers . my daughter and i love this set . if you want , i can send you a more accurate picture 
ours came with the one with anna and elsa on it . may have came with both . cant remember about the other one . 
too small for full . 
this comes with the twin sheet set 
the print on the fitted sheet is a silhouette of anna . the blanket print is flowers . my daughter and i love this set . if you want , i can send you a more accurate picture 
ours came with the one with anna and elsa on it . may have came with both . cant remember about the other one . 
too small for full . 
this comes with the twin sheet set 
the large plate from edge to edge is 9 3 4 inches but the actual area for food is about 6.5 inches . the small plates edge to edge is 7 inches then 4.5 for food area . the small bowl is 5.5 edge to edge and about 2 inches deep . the larger bowl is kinda weird . i like this set as a whole taut the lager bowl is shallow . edge to edge it is 8 inches but i feel like it seems more like a deep plate than a bowl . it seems to be about 1.5 inches deep . the mugs are average in size i feel . the width at the top is 3 inches . it is about 3.75 inches deep . the widest part of the handle is 1 inch so if you have big hands it may be kinda small . hope this helps . 
full size about 10inch plates , the set is actually really nice especially for the price 
i just received these and put them into the dishwasher and have not measured the dinner plates . they seem to be a satisfactory sized for a dinner plate , though . 
they are really porcelain . i have had them for several months . at first i thought they were a little small but that has worked very well after all . unless you need cereal bowls . but they survive the dishwasher and they do n't get hot in the microwave . 
after few months of use they are no marks 
they are made in china 
the plates are not heavy , moderate weight , just right for the microwave too . 
yes ... .some of the plates have already starting `` chipping '' ... .but i have 5 kids and they are probably alittle harder on them than i am ... .meh ... 
hi janie , they are bright white ! very nice set . diane s . 
yes they are microwave , dishwasher and also oven safe 
it comes in folded in half . it arrived in a box that was about 37 '' x 37 '' . hope this helps . 
we are not able to ship outside of the continental 48 united states . 
i apologize , but we do n't ship outside the united states at this time . 
hi , yes , we do . 
hi ! the product came with a cardboard attached to the back , so it can stand up . i think with a very good , sticky tape or hot glue gun , it can be attached to a wall . another alternative will be to make small holes through the cardboard and use fishing lines . hope i answered your question ! 
thank you for your inquiry . we do offer free shipping . perhaps you are buying through another seller who has shipping costs . please let us know if you have any further issues . 
no , i do n't think so . i remember it being just folded in half once , so it stood around 3 feet and was just about square . 
we do not unfortunately , we currently only offer shipping to the usa . 
honestly i just had to try and figure it out . i 'm . not sure the way i did it was correct either but it worked 
typically 3-6 days . 
yep ! it includes all 3 , they are very soft & still holding up well 
one 
i do n't believe it is . it is a standard twin size . 
yes ! they do have deep pockets for thicker mattresses 
i really do not know . i used it for a regular twin . not sure , but maybe it is offered in long 
it 's approximately 12 '' x9 '' x4 '' 
2 pin 
the actual machine will not burn your hand . no you can not control the settings like that . there are two different settings for the heat and one to use it as a fan . it 's just a nob you turn . 
turn knob on right ... ... ... ... .heater is cheap made ... .if you have not bought it ... ..do n't 
i use it in the bathroom more than any other room . just be careful to place it so that it is out of the way . away from any chance of getting wet or being in your path of entry or exit . 
yes 
the model number is so136a for which i received in february , 2014 . 
there is no automatic shut down so it keeps blowing . the heater has a small red light to indicate its functioning . the light is way too small to glow in a dark room . 
infrared 
i 'm not sure , but , honestly , this pillow was flat and lumpy within less than a month . if you have back and neck problems to begin with , i do n't recommend this pillow . 
yes it will 
one pillow . 
no it gives support to box spring for the full length of the bed 
the best way is measure frame under the mattress , go to lowes & buy plywood . the lumber department will cut the size you need . this will support the mattress . if you have a regular bed , i do n't recommend using wooden bed slats . they 're lightweight and wo n't support the mattress . 
it has been my experience that this does n't work for a queen size bed . the slats flex and fall off the frame . 
if it 's a twin size sofa sleeper it will not fit . this is a piece of garbage 
i do n't see why not . they are just a set of slats hooked together with two fibre tape strips . 
i was very disappointed ! there are about 16 1x2 slats . there are not quite enough to go the full length of the bed . i do n't know if my frame is a little large , but the slats are too short . i can just get them all up , and they are so thin that they bend enough to pop out . i would have been better off just buying 1 by 4s at home depot . 
yes 
i have been using this bed slats for a month and i would say that they are pretty strong . i bought a mid-beam from ikea for my bed . so , if you use them by installing mid-beam in your bed frame , it will be strong enough to handle any size of bed . i hope that helps you out to make your decision~ 
the width of the slats was n't the problem . they were too long to fit on the twin bed frame by one inch . i had to saw off the ends of each bed slat in order to use them . 
that is the price for one bucket and lid . 
hi joanne , i was able to put about 25lbs in . 
yes . i brined my thanksgiving turkey in it . 
dimensions : 17.5 in . d x 20 in . w x 36.5 in . h materials : metal , fabric , foam enrich your home decor with a set of chase swivel counter stools stools feature a sturdy metal construction stools have full 360 degree swivel overall height : 36 inches seat height : 24 inches back height : 12 inches set of two 24-inch stools is the perfect complement for any dining area wrought iron black finish and textured fabric with black and tan coloring assembly required 
i do n't know where they are made but you wont be disappointed with the craftsmanship . 
both swivel . 
they are smooth and a little rounded 
yes they are fairly comfortable . they have a good thick padding on the seat and seem to be holding up well . 
i do n't sell anything on amazon ! ? ? 
yes . probably without sewing . 
it is more greyish 
my son in law weighs a fit and healthy 190 lbs n 6ft 3in but if leans back the chair backs tips a bit . 
no i only gave the bar stools . 
love mine . it 's for the bottom of your oven to catch spills can take it out clean it off and put back in . no complaints or concerns with it . will never be without again . 
no instructions or warnings are included but i have used mine up to 450 f . 
can be put a bottom of oven , does not need to be on racks 
teflon coated fiberglass 
475 degrees . 
no 
two sheets . i 've used these for several months and really like them . each sheet is just a few inches wider than my narrow oven , and it curls up the sides a bit , which makes them even better at keeping the oven clean . i recommend them . 
the package that the liners came in never stated it could be used in microwaves . i usually use it in my oven so using it in your microwave would be taking a chance you may or may not have a positive outcome . 
it caused a few burns to the bottom of my new oven ! i think because i had my oven at 400 . 
i know i have had a temp over 400 degrees and also used the broiler and the liner is still fine . i was skeptical too but glad i bought it ! ! ! 
it 's white 
yes i have it on a full double bed . 
yes ! beautiful and great quality ! 
good quality no complaints 
no its not a nice dark hot pink ! but it still looks good , i had a hard time finding hot pink for my daughter but she loved that this had the zebra and cheetah so this is what we went with ! 
this listing is for twin , but there is a 7 piece queen set . 
no , it was the comforter , skirt , pillow case and 2 little pillows 
not at all . we have n't had any problems . my daughter loves it . 
i did not end up looking for pink twin sheets . i found some `` zebra '' twin sheets that look beautiful with it - and my daughter loves - loves them ! ! hope this helps ... 
thanks for your question , after searching our catalog , i did not find this listing in queen size . here 's some search results that you may be interested in : 
yes and my daughter loves it 
yes it is ... .bought for my granddaughter and she loves it ! you can measure the dimensions of your bed and compare it with the dimensions of the comforter ... hope that helps . 
no it does n't 
one pocket sandwich ! you use one half of the slice for the top of the pocket sandwich ( imprint of the animal ) and one half for the bottom where the filling goes . then you lay one half on top of the other and seal it . one slice of bread yield one pocket sandwich . 
you can mold the rice ball for the outer shape , and decorate the face using seaweed ( cut by scissors ) . cutezcute on facebook shared several pictures before . here is one . http : www.pinterest.com pin 47147127323169473 
i 've found that cutting each slice separately first helps keep nice edges and prevents tearing of the top slice . alternatively , you can just cut the top slice first , then keep it in the cutter and move the whole slice over the filled bottom slice and punch through . same idea , as you 're just cutting through one slice at a time . this all helps when using the sealer because the bread has n't been weakened by the cutting . you can also try gently rolling the bread flat first , or pressing just the part to be filled , leaving the edges un-smooshed before using the mold . this helps by making the bread more uniform , so it is n't such a big difference , the fluffy part of the bread versus the smooshed edges . 
i honestly think they are way to small to be filled . everything falls out . 
these are honestly not deep enough to be used as have sharp enough edges to be used as cookie cutters . this press is shallow and ridged and your dough will more than likely get stuck in the mold , and once it 's been pulled free the cute image will be distorted : ( this kit is meant to make a shallow impression on soft slices of bread and the sort or one can use both the front and back side of the press to create impressions on a hard boiled egg . 
it will work , but the images wo n't be as clean or be as visible . the cheap bread works the best , unfortunately , it is not so good for you ... 
the best way to determine if your monitor is representing the right color is to double check on another computer . different computer screens can give different color hues on the same picture . 
the queen size is 90 x 90 '' and the king size is 110 x 90 '' . all other measurements are listed in the description , down towards the bottom . 
this one is hard ... slate blue teal tinted ? it is not stark blue-aqua . gray tinted teal ? sorry i can not be more specific . 
comforter , 2 shams , 4 decorative pillows , bedskirt 
if i recall correctly you get two regular pillowcases , two euro pillowcases , three decorative pillows and the comforter . sheets are not included . 
yes . as long as it is in a wall stud . 
it does not - but its a great can crusher , i love the way it crushes the 24 oz and bigger cans . 
i have not tried to do that , however it will crush gatorade bottles and they are pretty thick plastic . also , if you dimple the sides of any aluminum container it will crush much easier . 
i have n't used it for 32 ounce cans but according to the description it does work for them . 
normally yes , but since im determined to prove to you and world that this is the best can crusher made today i will send you a replacement . please do n't attempt to crush aluminum bottles . only thin walled aluminum cans . just contact me with your info . 
i't will , but it 's not recommend for that . it will probably break it . it 's for al cans only . 
u can try but i do n't think it will because it does n't completely crush cans . it crushes them to about the height of cat food cans . it works well if u have tall cans . 
yes , it will crush the 24 oz cans . 
mine has been outdoors in rain for 3 months no problems yet but the unplated allen bolts have surface rust we just put a little waterproof bearing grease on top of the bolt heads 
yes , please check out this install and operation video we made . http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=ocqurnb-1io 
they are approximately 14.5 '' h x 8.75 '' w x 7 '' d. hope that helps . 
no . its110 120volts 
thermal carafe but the heater turns off before the coffee is fully brewed so it is always lukewarm : ( 
do n't bother . just get a different coffee pot . 
it grinds but i do n't know what kind of grinder it has . be aware that the coffee does n't come out very hot . we then heat some more in the microwave . 
no 
usually made coffee is pretty hot ! 
the lids seem to stay on . have n't had any accidents . my son puts his lunchbox in his backpack so the box turns on its side and it 's fine . 
we 've been using them for only about a month , but several times a week , going through the dishwasher each time , and i have n't noticed any difference at this point . i 've even packed yogurt and chocolate pudding in the smaller partition with the help of a little stick n seal wrap and it has n't leaked . 
the lid is marked # 5 - pp . hope that helps ! 
they fit into the usual size lunch bags we have -- roughly 6.5 x 8.5 x 3 inches- zippered around the top . they 'll fit in with a reusable `` juice box '' and a small freezer pack to keep it cool-but it 's tight . 
yes ! an applesauce cup does fit in it . i 've personally put them in it . it fits and closes just fine . no need to pour the applesauce into the container . 
a qualified yes . i have some standard short insulated zip-around that fit them perfectly . a tiny bit of head room for a thin ice pack and juice pouch ( probably not a juice box ) . the taller , boxy insulated zip-arounds have a smaller footprint and do n't fit them . the fold-down insulated bags are too small . i just bought an ebags lunchbox to accommodate more variety of drink options ( like a water bottle ) . 
8 1 2 x 5 1 2 x 1 1 2 
not sure where they are from but do not buy them , they do n't stay together at all . if you only put dry food items in them it works , but anything that potentially has a juice will leak out when turned on its side . the lids just do n't fit securely . 
yup ! definitely . these are great . i personally use one or two to bring to work and one at home for my son 's food . i think it 's a bit large for a toddler or preschooler really as the compartments are deep , but it 's easy to store leftovers since you can just cover and pop it back in the fridge . it 's perfect for a salad or bunch of fruit in the large compartment , a very good size portion of cottage cheese in the second largest cup ( full cup at least probably but i have never actually measured ) and then some salad dressing in the smallest cup ( which only uses about 1 6 of the space ) . a sandwich would fit perfectly i think . 
hi gingercook , thank you for your interest in a product from cut above home ! the salad spinner is so easy use use , no matter if you 're 9 or 90. once you have the lid on , it locks into place and the motion of your hand easily spins the salad at a high speed . please check out this link to a youtube video of the salad spinner , you 'll see how simple it really is ! https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=6w4ib3ggc74 
the external one has no drain holes , it holds the water . if you want to separate the greens from the water , you have to use both bowls toghether . you can use them toghether normally , not only when you want to dry the salad , but also to keep the salad for some days . 
the company states that it `` makes a conscious effort to avoid using bpas in their products . '' they do not state bpa free . 
you definitely should n't use it . the donabe is popular because the ceramic is porous - it likes to absorb water . in the microwave , water can evaporate very quickly and damage the ceramic , causing it to crack . you should also make sure the bottom is dry before using a stove . http : toirokitchen.com all_about_donabe how-to-take-care-of-your-donabe 
no need to season 
yes you can use this in the oven 
yes it is safe 
from end to end , it 's 6 inches . 
it can certainly be placed on the top during infusion , but does not fit like a lid . this is an excellent item ! 
we use about 4 teaspoons in a 48 oz tea pot . 
i tried this afternoon to find out just how `` waterproof '' the carry case is ( the answer is , not very ) . i added some water to the container , put the lid on , and shook it . while it did not pour out , there was no doubt that this lid is not a tight seal . i suppose that a large o-ring or perhaps some rtv could be used to seal it up , or a very large stopper would do the trick , but barring that , i would not carry wet tea in this unless you like tea leaking everywhere . 
that 's all i use in it is loose tea . i purchased some of the heavenly teas to use in it . 
it is 2.5 '' tall . 
good question . it snaps into place when you fold or unfold it , so you can lift it out of the mug with one handle . each side of the handle folds separately , and it stores nicely in the plastic container if you want to make a quick cup in the morning and bring the wet leaves to work with you for a second steeping . although it is not as big as my other infuser , it works perfectly with my 20 oz mug , and even fits the smaller opening on my 24 oz tea pot . i love it . 
yes they are both designed with extra fine holes so you can use with fine loose tea . 
i do n't have a answer for you . 
no , but in comparing photos they seem comparable ; and it is a fine infuser . i use mine for coffee as well , and only the finest of particles slip through ; but not much . i like it because it 's all stainless . if you do n't mind plastic in really hot water , some people prefer the finum brewing basket . if they made theirs in stainless i 'd consider it . 
hello . thanks for your interest in our items . the taps are made of plastic and silicone to ensure your fountain is food safe . the taps can be swichted and replaced and are available in a gold-plated version as well . we hope this helps ! 
dear franzeska , thanks very much for getting in touch . the volume of this fountain is 1 l and it has a height of 47 cm . best wishes , stefanie 
thanks for getting in touch - yes , we would ! 
it 's made out of glass . 
hello joe , thanks for getting in touch ! the average delivery time is 3-5 business days . 
27 3 8 inches 
do n't remeber exactly , but not more than about 20 lbs-it is easily lfted and set up by one person . 
32 '' tall , i believe-standard table height . 
i just use a timer , an it 's been working great 
i have a active air and a c.a.p one this is about same as the c.a.p not to loud but active air hydro farm one quietest of ones i bought . as for long term dont know havnt used long . carbon filters do stop filtering after a while so not sure how long filter part will last . 
i 'm not to positive but i 'm assuming any 4 '' carbon filter would work 
i am measuring just over 37 '' . this fits perfect for our trundle bed . 
i would find out the dimensions of a hospital bed mattress and compare . the queen size which i bought was true to size . i do not know how it would fold like a hospital mattress ; once it has filled up with air after unwrapping , it is rather firm . 
when i bought this mattress i also bought sleep master platform metal bed frame mattress foundation , queen . this provides a nice foundation for the mattress , the mattress and frame are very light and easy to move , and there is storage space underneath the frame . if you have a standard frame built to take a box spring then you made need a box spring or lay some plywood on the frame first . but i just went for the mattress sleep master frame combo . for $ 400 what the heck . i 'm very happy with it . 
no , it does need a platform though 
no 
it appears to be firm enough , but no guarantee over time . i put ours in our rv so it is completely supported underneath . i will say it provides for an amazing nights sleep , it is a great mattress . 
no 
yes ! 
foam is not too dense . there is adequate give 
unfortunately does not have a delayed start . due to food safety issues delayed start not a good idea . you can prep the food on the spit rods and keep refrigerated until ready to cook . this product is the best . 
15 pound turkey 
you need a special rack for the ribs and we did n't buy it . sorry we do n't know . but otherwise we really like the item . 
because when not in use , the legs fold underneath and it then sits level . 
yes there have to order from ronco website 
it says 1250 watts on the back of the machine . 
i have n't done a prime rib but i 've done a 5lb whole chicken , it does n't say in the manual either 
yes , we have not tried yet though . 
i believe the digital display and the vent system of the 5270 is the difference . i have a 5270 and i love it ! 
no : ( 
no , not at all ... i love mine . it saves so much that can be returned to the earth , i would recommend it to everyone that takes from the earth . 
i would use the filters or it will probably attract fruit flies bugs , i have not had an issue with this at all . the filters are pretty durable so they will probably last you a long time . i have n't had to change mine out yet and there is no change in their condition as far as i can tell . i ca n't really answer your second question , but my guess is you will only need to change them if they start to break down or become moldy . if this happened and you did n't change them it might make your kitchen smell or attract bugs unless you throughly clean the container after each use . 
push it down in the hole towards the top of the lid and then pull it out . to replace it , lay the new one it and slowly work it into the area between the top part of the lid and the middle area . 
not yet , we have had it for 4 months and put it through the dishwasher many times . 
yes ! you need to take out the charcoal filter at the top to replace and that can not be washed but the lid and bin have gone through our washer undamaged several times . 
i think it is one or two gallon , the description says how much it holds . my family four needs to empty it once or twice a week , and it stands about a foot tall . 
one ! 
from bottom to top of lid is just under 12 inches 
should be easy to find at bed bath & beyond or similar stores . 
unfortunately no box says made in china . 
approx . 93 1 2 `` x 114 1 2 '' ( excluding fringe ) . fits our queen size mattress fine . 
i think it does . i 'm a dog sitter thus must have washable bedding that holds up well through dogs & frequent washing . so far so good . stains come out well ! 
our king size spread is 10 feet 2 inches wide ( side to side - including the fringe ) and 9 feet 9 inches long ( head to foot - including the fringe at the foot , no fringe at the head ) after washing once and running through the dryer several times . if you are very careful , yes , it will cover the pillows on a queen size bed , but just barely - there is no extra to spare . 
yes , they 're sold separately . i did n't buy the shames only the spread . i love the spread . 
yes , it is a soft bedspread , and very nice looking , has a good nap to it . but remember , if you buy the shams , they are sold separately , not as a set 
i got mine on amazon also . but they are sold in singles , not a pair . 
it is not thin . my wife said it is medium . 
i 'd say medium weight . there is the fabric ( i would equate with a good quality muslin ) with the design in chenille . i do n't like a very heavy spread as i get too hot . hope this helps . 
nope . there 's pretty noticeable gaps between the glass plates . it 's not bad , but if you have something very sensitive to dust , this might not be what you need . 
i have it on a carpeted floor and it is very stable . 
nope . it is not . 
yes , it just takes a little time to put it together 
yes will definitely fit.. 
not sure , i bought this for my mom . but , i can tell you she has the shelves filed with ask her nice china . has n't been a problem . 
14 inches deep x 16 inches wide x 62 inches high 
clicks pulls open from the front 
yes you can , hard to put together . but looks nice and opens easily . 
the shelves on the display are not moveable . the sides , where the shelves sit , are welded in place . we use ours for a display case at our company and many people have complimented on it . i use & lt ; sunthin warm white dimmable led under cabinet lighting set of 3 , touch dimmer included & gt ; to illuminate the shelves . they are bright and i have them so they look like they are part of the display case . 
the upright black pieces that hold the shelves are wood . the base and top appear to be an engineered wood product with a black plastic laminate . 
i purchased this item a couple months ago . yes ... . all 4 sides are glass . 
not too hard . took about half an hour . certainly would be easier having some help . i did it by myself . i 'm comfortable building things so doing it myself was n't a stretch for me . if you 've put together ikea- type furniture , then this would be very similar . 
it is 9 '' 
i 've asked that question too but given the 33 '' height , it 's probably @ 8 '' . might be 9 or 10 if your lucky ! 
the 2 glass shelves are 1 8 '' thick . the space between each shelf is 10 5 8 '' and the shelves fit securely in the cabinet . i have a collection of clay figurines in my cabinet and there are 7 figurines on each shelf . i feel they are safe in this cabinet . if your urn is heavy , you might consider placing it on the bottom of the cabinet . i love this cabinet ! 
16 3 4 '' w x 14 1 2 '' d x34 '' h 
hi - just took a tape measure to one glass shelf , 9.5 '' x 15 '' is length width 
it is a glass curio ( display case ) 
no , there seems to be no gap . 
the distance between the shelves is 12 - 12 1 2 inches . 
no 
10 '' x22 '' 
i do n't really think there 's a way to do that . but it is a very nice cabinet . 
it comes with some metal parts that you attach to the glass at the bottom . it closes well . 
it does have 4 . 
just about 22 '' l x 10 '' w 
2 doors that swing open out from the center go from top to bottom . easy access to entire cabinet . 
it 's 64 inches high 
24 '' wide , 15 '' deep 
of course , mine is 50 '' and fits just fine . great product 
47 ' for one unit 
hi beth . i would say it is slightly matte laminate . i love this console ! i have it set up similar to the picture and it 's beautiful . 
it will fit dear my dvd is almost 18 so there 's no problem good luck 
one is a hair more than 47 inches and the other is 15 inches . i have mine separated by about two inches and it looks interesting . totally spread out looks great also and is sturdy for any tv . 
yes it can , but its not really wide enough to be really used it as coffee table 
composite board 
12 3 4 `` 
when it comes you put the pieces together yourself . you can flip them anyway you want . you can set it up like the picture or put it standing straight up . hope this answers your question . 
they are separate pieces that you can adjust by moving the piece that sits on top wider or closer together . it 's really cool and very modern looking ! 
i 'm not sure about the pan ( i only bought the 2 pack silicone mats ) , but from research it seems that the company has a us address but the mats , at least , are manufactured in china . their website is n't very clear but maybe you can call them for more info . hope this helps . 
yes 
about 15 '' by 11 '' , good size jelly roll pan 
every silicone mat i 've ever seen says not to use it above 425. the silicone starts to break down above that temperature . parchment paper ( at least the brands i 've seen ) is n't food safe above that temperature either . 
it depends on how much your cookie dough spreads - whether your cookies are mounds or flat . a cookie sheet with interior space measurements of 10 '' x15 '' will fit 4 across by 3 down . hope this helps . 
no i would not cut it , it is a heavy metal and might be sharp 
i really do n't have the answer to that . hope not because love the product . remember your aluminium pans probably do have toxins and how long have we been baking directly on those . 
i have not cut them up - but i have looked this up on line & with the silpat company & they said no . do not cut as the fiberglass mesh particles might migrate into the food . 
no . company in wisconsin but product made in china . 
ambiguous it is ! one mat and one pan . pan is heavy duty . got mine as a lightning deal and price was very good . do not think you will be disappointed . 
four compartments 1.5 '' x14 '' 
i would compare the size of your bottles to an opi bottle . the opi bottles are probably the widest it can fit . hope that helps 
i do not own any deborah lippmann polishes . this holder holds both square and round bottles equally well . the brands that i have in mine are : opi , cnd , seche vite , butter london , essie , orly , zoya , mac and illamasqua . the only brand that i own that will not fit in here is china glaze , its bottle is too large . 
yes , i do n't have those brands but looking up the image for them i believe that would fit just fine . 
opi yes the nicole polishes i know wo n't fit it 
hello kyi , they should fit , as the opening is a little bit over 1-1 4 '' wide u.s. acrylic , llc 
not exactly sure of the weight but it is not heavy at all but also made of good quality . i do not use it for nail polish but it is used for my essential oil collection . perfect fit ! 
hi , mary ! ' nicole ' polish will fit in , just not in an organized , straight way . sort of 1 2 cocked . now unless all your polishes are ' nicole ' ( or how many ) everything else has fit . and , i have a lot of polishes , many , many different brands . i ended up buying a second . i am honestly very happy w this product . i can see everything , & find what i am looking for . hope this helps . ; ) 
no 
works well on vinyl . 
yes you can i have been since i got mine love it 
i am not sure , but if you have not purchased the steamer yet , i would not . i liked the shark one i had a lot better . sorry i could not help on the pad question . 
maybe 2-3 lbs . 
i did n't see a fill line either . i just make sure i do n't overflow it . make sure it does n't go into the neck of the tank and it works fine . 
i would call electrolux , my steamer is in the shop right now . it was not getting hot enough , & electrolux had me bring it to a repair shop . maybe they can help you ? 
about 15min . wet the mop before you start that will save some running time 
i read it did that the first couple uses . mine was used and never has . 
you really are n't supposed to use any floor cleaner with it . the steam does the work . never put anything but plain water in the tank . if you 're determined to use something along with the steam , an occasional spray from a bottle directly onto the floor would be the only acceptable cleaner . the beauty of steam cleaning is that it cleans and sanitizes without the toxic chemicals . 
i believe you are comparing the shipping weights , which will make the 5 liter crock we carry more heavier as it includes the ceramic weights and wooden stomper . also , the 5 liter crock is a heavier earthenware , while the blue & white 10 liter decorative crock is made from fine grain white clay , same high quality material used to make porcelain dinnerware . porcelain clays are denser and thus less porous than ceramic clays making the material more harder and lighter in weight . because the material is harder , the wall thickness for the decorative crock is slightly thinner than that of the 5 liter ceramic . both crocks are quite durable ! 
there is a normal natural color variance in ceramics due to the firing process and natural variation in raw materials used . as a result the white color can vary from a cool white hue to a slightly warmer ivory white . 
the split ceramic weights are available on our website , as well as amazon . search for the sku : b00gf13k7i and you should be able to find them.thanks ! 
the crock is certainly lead and cadmium free . the glaze is applied to both the exterior and interior of the crock .

sure . should be no problem on a grill . i found this on sur la 's site : versatile steel is safe for the oven or the grill , works as a stovetop griddle on conventional and induction stovetops , and can even be chilled to create a cold plate perfect for serving chilled appetizers , mixing up icy confections and more . 
try taking half as long to preheat as you did before ... so if you preheated for 30 minutes then try 10-15. you can always climb up to temp but if its too hot at the start then your food will burn too fast . also , try placing on indirect heat ( the cooler side of your grill ) . steel will still soak up and retain the heat but at a slower rate for more control . good luck ! enjoy ! 
you can but it will dull your pizza cutter . i transfer it to a board to cut 
definitely not stainless steel . according to baking steel 's web site the product is made from recycled steel . so it is likely not carbon steel . nevertheless , it works wonderfully if you follow the suggestions . 
the directions say not to use water . just a steel brush . it 's ok if it stains . will season and give it a more authentic look . 
not sure , but i think i get what you are asking . the pizza steel basically lives in your oven and would be too hot to smoosh out pizza on it . this kinda thing requires a floured ( or corn meal dusted ) pizza peel to transfer the pie from your counter to the oven , a scenario that would n't really work with oil . if you want oil in your crust , you can either mix it in or use a cast iron pan instead of the steel . 
i have an aluminum peel with wood handle and use it to slide my pizza or bread dough from peel to steel and visa versa . the baking steel can get some scratches from use but it has no effect on the sheet as it is only cosmetic . 
it does n't come with one . i do n't know if one can be purchased , because i do n't think one is necessary . 
i have cooked chicken on the steele but i did partially bake it on a pan , then finished it on parchment paper on the steele . came out great 
14 '' by 14 '' i am very pleased with mine . 
a little cornmeal under the pizza will keep it from sticking ... and add flavor to the pizza.. 
i do n't really have an exact on the weight if someone else can help with that . my best guess is around 10lbs ? i 'm pretty terrible at guessing weights though . anyhow , i have made frozen pizzas without thawing ( the book does n't recommend ) . just cook it a little longer than the 5 minutes it says for thawed . maybe 8 or 9. i keep the temp around 2. just keep an eye on it . this product gets very hot . it 's an excellent product . 
the oven has a pizza stone for making `` standard '' pizza . it works quite well . i love it ! it also comes with a teflon coated pan for `` deep dish '' pizza with i never use . i do n't care for deep dish pizza . 
we have not had that issue ... .i always warm the oven on the # 1 setting . after the light goes off and the unit warms for roughly 10 minutes , i then turn the knob to # 2 just before cooking a pizza . we had some issues the first time we used it and the pizza was n't perfect but once we figured out our system , it has been perfect ever since . we just started pre-making pizzas when we are having people over and only cooking them half way earlier in the day and then finishing the cooking when we are ready to serve . they turn out great and you do n't have the mess of preparation while you have guests . ( unless its a pizza party and some of the fun is having everyone prepare their own ) 
ca n't say . i only own this one . it is so good i bought another for my winter vacation home . then again , i bought them both on sale . 
have not measured with a thermometer , but it does get super hot . it cooks a great pizza . 
i have n't done that , but it may work if you prepare your crust on parchment and slide the whole thing on your pizzeria . i make my crusts on parchment and they cook perfectly and are easy to put on and take off . heating on 3 and cooking on 1 has also worked best for me . let us know how it works for you . 
yes , but you must watch closely . it heats up quickly . 
no window 
use the stone as a template to cut a round of parchment paper . put your dough on the paper that you 've placed on the peel . put paper and pizza on hot stone to bake . the paper will scorch , but not catch fire . you will have a perfectly crisp crust and zero sticking ... the pizza will slide right off the paper ! ! hope that helps !

yes it will . i own the gallon size as well and all of these have worked well for me . they have the 3 and a half inch openings . 
hello daniel , i 'm afraid i do n't know of any other place where you can purchase consumer quantities of just the lid . if you would like one of these lids un-drilled i 'm sure we can accommodate you . if you decide to order , please just add a comment to your order requesting it be `` un-drilled '' . 
i believe it is 64 ounces . 
yes , as pictured , the lid holds the infusing ice cube column . 
i handwash it with some liquid soap , like dawn , or palmolive , etc . and it cleans very well . i would n't put it in a dishwasher , as it may damage it . 
plastic . 
amazon description states bpa-free . 
i feel as though it is . i bought this and filled it up but could not get the lid to stay closed- rather it pushed up and partially out of the water . i returned the product . 
64 ounces 
no . even when full of fruit the top will just bob in the water . 
i have tried both , and they are both excellent pitchers . however this one is much better priced , i believe the prodyne retails for like $ 19.99 
right now , no , but i have contacted escali which is the manufacturer and they said they are weeks away from releasing it , so it will be very soon 
no . the application does n't have scanning capabilities . you can search the item and view more information on the nutritional facts 
based on the size of the app , i am assuming it is pulling from the internet . 
no so far its not available and it would be very good to develop one . 
currently the app is only compatible with apple products , but they are in the process of working on launching an android equivalent app . let me know if you have other questions , thanks 
looks to be about 1-6 32 '' or exactly 30 mm on the two upper horizontal bars.. 
it weighed around 11 lbs . not sure about dimensions 
it is not collapsible , you would have to take it apart to transport . 
plastic 
yes , fully functional on both sides although only one side has the routed - groove for liquids . very nice unit . 
i use the common mineral oil available at the grocery store -- works well ! i try to remember to apply it once a week . i 've really enjoyed this cutting board . 
hello , this bamboo cutting board is manufactured in china . 
not really a top or bottom , one side is flat and one side has a groove ( as seen in photo ) 
it will last for many years if you do n't wash it in the dishwasher . my previous one was still going strong but someone `` borrowed '' it . it is much more durable than maple . it does n't seem to take knife marks like other hardwood cutting boards . 
the logo exists only on the grooved side . 
i 'm sorry i do n't know if formaldehyde is used or not . the board is very nice though . 
yes it is , why the concern ? not all products from china are bad , it all depends what you are buying , and if it is food , well ! that is a question to debate about , but i am pleased with my cutting board . 
yes 
i have not had problems with it slipping around , but maybe i do n't go at as aggressively as you do . i have also not had any problems with it splitting , but do not use very often and have not used it for meat yet , so have only had to rinse it off lightly . 
the bottomless , in my opinion , produces a far better crema and flavor . with the bottomless , it is more dependent on the level of the grounds tamped , along with how fine your grounds are . if your grounds are n't evenly tamped ( or level ) inside the bottomless portafilter , your espresso shot may spray a bit against the back wall , or into the surface your machine is placed on . with the dualspout portafilter , you tamp your grounds and are essentially good to go . the bottomless is more technical , but produces a better result . experimenting is part of the fun . this has been a fantastic purchase in my opinion . i 'm a first time espresso machine owner , and this machine performs very well . 
i ca n't really say anything about the gaggia classic since i have never used it . i can tell you that i am partially satisfied with the capresso . i do n't particularly like the design of the 2 portafilters , especially the one designed for one cup . the instructions say that it requires `` practice '' to use it properly and it looks from all the reviews that everybody has the same problem : coffee `` spraying '' out in all directions . manual says that skills of a barista are required to use it properly : so basically they are trying to make the user feel totally inadequate to justify what seems to me a bad finicky design . the steaming wand is good although it only has one setting : on or off . you can not regulate the amount of steam like in other espresso machines . all in all it is ok. not the best . 
there is a tamper that comes with the machine ; however , it is made of plastic , has an odd shape , is nearly 2mm smaller than the bottomless portafilter , and is hard to get a proper grip on . if you 're like me , you 'll find yourself having a hard time getting it to tamp flat . this is n't a big deal with the pressurized basket , but if you want to use the bottomless portafilter , i would say a proper stainless steel tamper ( of the proper size ) is a good investment . i took some measurements : the tamper that it comes with is around 49.5mm and the bottomless portafilter has an inner diameter of roughly 51mm . i was just eyeballing with a ruler , so do n't take these measurements as exact - i do n't have a caliper lying around , so i ca n't get more accurate than that . i bought a 51mm tamper ( measuring with a ruler , the tamper 's actual diameter looks to be 50.5mm ) , and it fits almost perfectly . there 's just barely a half millimeter of give when i put that tamper in the bottomless portafilter , as opposed to nearly 2mm of give with the tamper it comes with . i took a few pictures of the measurements and will upload one each of the tamper and the bottomless portafilter shortly . 
no afraid this too is made in china even though the company , capresso , is in new jersey . 
hi alexander , i had the same problem when i first got my capresso too . the issue is not with the machine , but with the coffee grind and your tamp . your coffee grind needs to be extra fine and the tamp has to be even . when you tamp it , if the espresso disc is higher on one side or not tamped evenly , it will cause the espresso to pour out of the top . i purchased the capresso burr grinder here ( http : www.amazon.com capresso-560-01-infinity-grinder-black dp b0000ar7sy ) and use the second extra fine setting . i also bought a heavier tamp ( http : www.amazon.com rsvp-terrys-tamper-for-espresso dp b0001xrnem ref=pd_bxgy_k_img_z ) . the thing that helped the most was watching some youtube videos on how to make perfect espresso shots . it took a few days of practice , but they come out perfectly now . if you can try to master the bottomless portafilter . the shots will have more crema . i have never used the frothing wand , so i ca n't speak to the foam . hope that helps 
the pump is actually from italy . 
this is not a professional grade appliance , it has no nsf marking , in fact on the bottom it says for home use only .. 
i 'd say it 's about a quart . it 's enough to make about 4 to 6 drinks depending on whether you stream milk or pull longer shots . it is removable , very easy to refill and transport . 
sounds to me like the coarseness of the grind . another symptom of too course a grind is that the coffee would be weaker than expected and the flow output would be faster . i would recommend you experiment a little , timing carefully the grind time . increase it in increments of five seconds or so and see the impact on crema and flavor . once you find the grind time you like , you 'll want to be fairly precise in repeating that time to get a consistent result . 
i believe it is . not 100 % positive . i love the machine . cappuccino looks just like ones we had in italy . 
yes , it is real , it 's not at all wavy or having some fun house effect . i was really pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product ... i totally recommend it ! 
yes you can if it 's on the right angle . it fits all of my jewelry ! i would change some things about it but it 's functional 
there are two very small drawers on the inside at the bottom 
there are compartments that can hold post earrings . the others can be placed stored on over the rails . 
yes it does 
the mirror is the size of the front of the cabinet . it is approx 18 in wide by 4.5 ft long . i would actually measure it for you , but it was a gift for my daughter , so it is at her house . it is the size of a standard full length mirror , like the ones that stand on their own in a frame and bracket . 
bright white . 
not that much . i was missing 2 pieces that i could not find locally so i returned the mirror . 
yes , np even if you are quite cloise to it . yes , even if you are quite close to it . however , the view is better if you are a few feet away . y 
yes 
according to the product description , `` usable in heats up to 420 degrees f. '' i would surmise that applies to microwaves , but it is n't specified in the ad copy . however , most heating scenarios would cause pressure to build so , if one of these lids is sealed tight to a container , there would likely be a sudden and messy , if not hazardous , release of that pressure . i have not yet purchased this product , so i do n't know if there are additional instructions included that might allow such use . 
absolutely ... .they were made for this application . we have used them for years in microwave ovens . 
yes they can go in the microwave not the oven . 
these lids are not what i expected . they do not stretch much at all . they are barely useable . 
sorry , they all come in a sealed package together . 
yes i know . that was my problem also . it is apparently some kind of copy of the original . i learned my lesson . i will always check for manufacturing label from now on . 
not sure where they are made , but they are garbage . they rip when you stretch them . 
i do n't know why not ? not done that but we have jused every thing else . 
these are two separate units by the manufacturer , though similar . you may be able to contact the manufacturer , as listed in the amazon spec , to see if it is possible to buy the top squeezer and attach it to the one you have without the top . but i belive you will have to buy the one with the top . 
the juicer holes are in the head of the owner , excuse me , in the head of the unit . 
i found no paperwork to that effect . mine has had no issues thus far . 
it has a very powerful motor so hand strength is required to both press the fruit down onto the spindle as well as to keep the fruit from just spinning with the spindle rather than being juiced . you would probably be better off with the chef 's star stainless steel electric juicer with citrus press . http : www.amazon.com chefs-stainless-electric-juicer-citrus dp b00frl9jyu ref=sr_1_3 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1391294595 & sr=8-3 & keywords=chef+star+electric+juicer 
it is a forty pound hopper . it is a little tight , but it will hold 1 full bag of pellets . 
it generates 35000 btu on the highest setting . the setback from the wall is 9 inches . the website is castlestoves dot com . 
no . but it 's pretty easy to rig up a battery back up with a small inverter and a car boat battery . 
$ 239 a ton at home depot . 
no , it is a pellet stove only . 
2 watts you are only powering a small fan which uses very little power 
yes it is thank you great stove 
yes it must be vented . we went right through the wall ( insulated pipe of course ) but you can vent through the roof if you want . 
go to the manufacturer 's website and download the owner 's manual . there is a diagram in the manual that provides dimensions for the pad and the clearance requirements . http : www.castlestoves.com foundations store shopdetail.asp ? params=12327 & tab=docs 
10 lbs 
i weigh 220 and mine completely collapsed on me and broke into about 7 different pieces . i would n't recommend this to anyone . it is down right dangerous . 
14 1 2 l x 11 3 4 w x 15 h 
the bottom half is just at 1 '' while the top is a bit thicker around 1.75 '' . 
some times 
approx . 18 '' from top of handle to bottom of foot . we findthem very handy . 
yes it does . it 's a great little stool . 
i sent it to my daughter at college so i 'm not sure but she says it 's sturdy and holds her weight well but she only uses it to get up and down from her bunk bed . 
15 inches 
i do n't find it difficult to push at all . it has really good suction , though , so pulling back requires a bit more force . a normal , healthy adult would have no problem with it . someone with musculoskeletal issues might feel , a bit of strain . 
not familiar with panasonic vacuums . we have had a kirby , a hoover wind tunnel and most recently an lg ( who no longer makes vacuums ) . we bought then returned the prolux . we tested the dyson animal , the shark rotator professional , the electrolux ( forgot the model ) . then we went to a couple of local vacuum shops . tried the riccar and the meile . we bought the meile and very glad we did . it is worth the money . 
yes it has a full bag indicator . i do n't think it necessarily stops when jammed although this has not happened to me yet . i have not tried to replace the rolller or belt yet but i do n't think it would be too hard . 
yes it does : ) it works on all types of carpet and then with the floor tool it cleans hardwood and tile etc . so yes it will work on any type of flooring . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
i know what the problem is . i had the same thing happen to me . here are the instructions for attaching the handle . the 7000 model has a slight variation in the instructions , which someway preventso the handle from laying down flat for low position . i learned this the hard way . the instructions read : 1 ) remove handle screw . 2 ) insert handle into top of dust cover with handle switch facing fforward ( model 7000 only ) . 3 ) align small hole on handle with screw hole in dust cover . insert screw and tighten securely ( all models ) . after that just turn cord hook upward and wrap cord between the hooks . to quick release cord , turn upper hook downward . hope this helps . this sweeper is great , and i hope you get a manual soon because it has a fuse to replace sometime , and a secondary filter that needs cleaned after every third dust bag replacement . 
no , to my knowledge you can not turn off the beater bar . the head self adjusts to the surface . it seems to do fine going from thick pile carpet to thin indoor outdoor polypropylene carpet to porcelain in my home . the beater bar is approximately 11.5 '' and the brushes can be replaced . 
there are 2 resets , 1 located on the back and the motor also has a fuse that is replaceable or contact your seller . 
11.75 '' . it 's a very nice quality vacuum at this price point . i kept it despite the one drawback ... almost an 8 '' clearance is needed to get under furniture . if you have a vacuum that can get under furniture , keep it as i did . 
i do n't know the exact weight , but it is easy to push on any surface . i have thick carpets and i love how it self - adjusts from the carpet to ceramic tile . i do n't have to use a lot of strength to use it . i highly recommend this vacuum . the best i have ever had . great suction and very simple to put together also . 
it does a good job with the hair , but we 've been disappointed because of the smell the vacuum emits . we have two labrador retrievers who live in the house , and we typically have to buy a new vacuum cleaner every two years because of the 'dog ' smell . no matter what we do or how much we clean them , they start to smell like dogs . we decided to go with a bagged vacuum this time to see if it would make a difference , and it has turned out to be worse ! it started smelling like 'dog ' within a couple of months . we 've changed the filters and my husband even put a bounce sheet over the exhaust filter , but nothing has helped . i 'm afraid we 're going to have to purchase a different vacuum cleaner . 
the filter is designed to be washed and used again . no disposable filters . 
the ionic air removes 'bad ' smells from your home . you do not want pets or people in the room ( s ) while it 's operating with the ozone on . the unit can be completely turned off but the purification only happens with the ozone set to 'on ' . it comes with 2 washable plates . we used both plates , but some only use one . we used it on a 1300 sq . ft. rental house that had been lived in by smokers who were not supposed to smoke in the house but did . within 3 days of 24 7 use of the ionic air , the entire house was rid of the stale smoker smell . it smelled fresh and clean like we 'd had the windows open on a warm , spring day . it works for pet smells , too . be sure to open the windows to let the ozone out for a few minutes before re-occupying the room ( s ) . 
i 've only had this unit since july and it is operating perfectly . i have another one of the same model that i 've had for more than one year and it 's still working perfectly without changing the ion plate . great product ! 
there are two dials on the front of the machine . one dial is for the ozone option , the other for the regular air cleaning option . if you do n't want the ozone option , do n't turn the ozone dial on . each dial has a definite clicking sound alerting you that you have turned it on or off . only the ozone option uses a plate ( 2 of them ) inserted in the rear of the machine that creates ozone . you have the option of inserting one or both plates . you will have to experiment once you purchase the machine whether you will need both or not . everything depends upon how bad the odors are you are trying to remove . the fan in the machine is very powerful . you can adjust the strength of the fan and ozone output by turning the dials . 
yes it will 
do n't really have an exact answer to that , but it does put out a good bit and that 's the `` rain fresh '' smell we like that it puts out . we typically put the ozone control on low when we leave the house and turn it off when we return home . even on the low setting the entire house smells very fresh and after turning off the ozone , we leave the ionizer on med fan speed 24 7. hopes this helps you : ) 
turn it upon high over night . 
no 
i have 2 dog 's that have access to my whole house also . i run my unit on low ( both controls ) , and have not had any problems with either of my dogs . my house smells so fresh , even on the low setting . i was told by my dog groomer that it would be best to run it on that setting ( low ) . i plan on putting it in my basement also , but will put it on a higher setting down there as they do n't have access . 
i would have to say yes ... i 've heard crime scene clean up crews use this same technology . it took cat litter smell out of my home . 
yes ! it 's awesome ! you can take the hose straight out and it already has the long part to get around the corners but you can pull the inner one out and twist . ( it 's all connected ) which makes the hose even longer ... super long . and there is a small rolling apolstry atachment that you can put on and clean under bed ... or a wider non rolling one . it 's awesome ! 
yes . toe . 
great-vacation america is the company . they are located in utah . they are wonderful to work with : ) 
thanks for the question : ) actually this model works great on hardwood floors . there are 2 ways you can use it . 1. use it in normal vacuum mode . the brushroll will continue to spin unless the vacuum is upright . however its designed to not allow the brushroll to tough your hardwood floors . in this way it sucks up the dirt without scratching floors . also if you read the reviews on this one and the prolux 7000 you will see several people use it for hardwood floors like this and love it . 2. the prolux 6000 is equipped with a floor tool . if you want to you can lock the vacuum in upright position and attach the hose and tool wand to the floor tool and it works great that way as well . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin 
no , it 's a manual wrap around but , it is a great vacuum ... love it ! 
great question and yes the handle on the prolux 7000 model are very nice . however they work differently so unfortunately the handles are not interchangeable . you would have to actually buy the 7000 model . they are both great vacuums its just the 7000 has a little more bells and whistles : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
great question . its actually one of the lightest full powered ( 12 amp ) vacuums on the market . it only weights 17.8 lbs right out of the box . so in the vacuum cleaner industry when you hear a weight of a vacuum it does not include the cord weight . why ? because while you are vacuuming the cord is usually on the ground and not on the vacuuming while you are vacuuming . i hope that helps : ) let us know if you have any other questions . thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
great question : ) let me go over the differences real quick . 1. the 7000 has led bulbs that probably wont ever need replaced . the 6000 has normal bulbs . 2. the 7000 has hospital grade real hepa filter while the 6000 has the standard hepa filter . if you have serious allergies the 7000 will be the one that you want to get . if not then the 6000 will be just fine . 3. on board tools . the main extension wand extends more on the 7000 and on the 7000 all the on board tools have their own spot where they snap onto the back of the vacuum . with the 6000 all the tools are attached to the outside of the main wand . either way tools on both models are easily used . 4. the 7000 model has the on off button right where your hand is when your vacuuming . so turning on and off is very simple . the 6000 has the on off on the body of the vacuum . i hope that helps : ) as you can see from the reviews either one is a great as they are a well built vacuum . these vacuums normally retail for 700 so its a good deal and they will last for many years to come . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
great question : ) so first of let me start out by explaining vacuuming shag carpet and why its different . so this is one of the lightest vacuum cleaners made . however its a very powerful deep cleaner and the heaviest part of any vacuum cleaner is the suction motor . so i would not suggest returning it for a lighter vacuum as it will not clean as good . shag carpet is thicker and is also more absorbent of dirt and debri . in other words it will hold more dirt in it and also requires a more powerful vacuum to clean it like the prolux 6000. so yes it is normal for vacuum cleaners to be harder to push in shag as its sealed down to the carpet and really working to clean them . so you can get a lighter vacuum but i would not suggest it as it wont clean as good . so how to make it easier ? this sounds funny but you could vacuum backwards by trying to pull the vacuum more than trying to push it . you could also use the floor tool as its not as wide and would be easier to push . however doing that wont clean as good . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
hi there . unfortunately , i can not attach a document to this page . can you go ahead and send an e-mail over , so i can attach the directions in my response ? thank you . 
thank you for your inquiry . this item is manufactured in china . 
thank you for your inquiry . the overall height is 27.3 inches and the seat height is 16.5 inches . 
thank you for your inquiry . the weight capacity is 120 kgs , or roughly 265 pounds . 
no , but the surface was very easy to clean with a sponge and detergent by standing on non outlet end in the sink . i thought it was easier to clean than models that could be submersed . 
yes , you can use olive oil or butter when cooking on this griddle . 
no ... just a warming tray that slides underneath 
i can only tell you , i tried to set it on warm and sometime it would work . i melted the end of a spatula on warm . i returned it to the the mfr . and it was replaced with a same griddle with a black cooking surface that works fine . i am sure that the first one was defective and based on comments i have seen , it 's not the only one ! 
i would send it back . mine has not peeled but it is not very stick resistant . 
they have 3 models ... . there 's the black creme model that is the same as the champagne creme model , but the plain black one has a flip top that looks like it has a grill on one side and a griddle on the other ( i did not see where a warming tray would fit on the all black model ) . i 'm guessing that the all black one is so expensive due to its grill griddle flip capability . 
jorge `` steamed heat '' panni was one of the greatest luchadores on the traveling circuit in the early 1920s . his trademarked move , `` the panni press , '' never failed to fall an opponent . panni would swiftly maneuver to gain position on his rivals . once their backs were to him , he would line his body against theirs ; clutching them very closely . then , using his great strength , superior flexibility and overwhelming size , he would begin to bend his body ; essentially folding his opponent in half at the waist , leaving them breathless , dazed , covered in sweat and embarrassed . once they were incapacitated , panni would `` garnish '' his rivals , finishing them off with a move he called `` the pickle spear ; '' much to the delight of the crowd . 
i have been using it for sandwiches and even warming up tortillas . it heats up pretty fast , but does n't get dangerously hot on the outside..then it cools down pretty quick ... it has never taken 40 mins to cool ... maybe around 10 15 mins at most . it gets kind of hot on the outside like a wafflemaker would- if you have one , then you can judge for yourself . 
this unit is 1200 watts . 
they do not - it is an `` all in one piece '' unit . it does clean up very easily and we would have liked one where the plates came out , but the ceramic was more important to us as we did n't want the teflon coating in others . 
the one i have is model : ckstwfbf10w-eco . 120v-60hz 1080w . the transformer should work . 
the style name : ckstpm20w-eco is black on the outside . the style name : ckstpm20wm-eco is silver on the outside . 
not that i 've seen anywhere , and it seems i looked everywhere before buying this one . 
works fine for me . i use a bit of non-stick spray oil and wipe down with paper towel . 6 months now no problem at all ... ... 
no , the grates are not removable . 
i would say yes . we have made paninis and cooked meats of varying thicknesses and the top of the press can `` adjust '' to appropriately `` sandwich '' whatever we are cooking . 
yes . each section is 12 '' across and 16 '' tall . 
dear , thanks for your question . about this painting . we also have other larger size : 16x20inchx3pcs ( 40x50cmx3pcs ) : $ 69.9 20x24inchx3pcs ( 50x60cmx3pcs ) : 99.9 if you want to buy , please let us know , we can send the link to you , thanks . any question , feel free to contact us . best vilavi 
each picture is 12x 16 inch . the total size is 36x 16 inche 
yes . you are correct . 
it might not be a good idea because of the moisture . 
great purchase , the wall art has added a wonderful accent to my by bedroom wall . pops with color . 
each section is 12 x 16 
it is black on the edges . looks good . 
i 'm honestly not sure since i 'm not familiar with giclee print 
yes you can , with just one tea spoon of oil added on top . 
yes , i batter most of the food i cook in it . 
you 'll be surprised at how juicy the chicken turns out when cooked in this air fryer . it 's fairly easy to prepare and best of all healthy without losing its tastiness . 
dry foods that come as frozen : for example i spray my frozen french fries with butter and add some salt , and they come out to taste great ! i love eating raw broccoli and spray it with some olive oil : ) kids frozen nuggets are to oily so i just placed them like that 
i 'm not sure about meat , i 've used it many times on chicken and fish and my wife cooks vegetables . the french fries , fish and chicken tastes like a 5 star restaurant cooked them . it cooks in about 14 minutes and i use olive oil with spices . i have pancreatitis so i have cut down on the red meat and my wife cooks that in the oven . you 'll love this because it does n't use grease . i give it a 10+ . 
about 12 pounds 
yes you can . wings and thighs are wonderful cooked in the fryer . the skin is crisp and the meat is juicy . i have n't tried cooking a breast so ca n't rate it 's performance there . 
its not much concept wise ... this definitely cooks much better than a convection oven though ... it takes a little trial and error to cook things in the flip other than chicken strips and fries but when ya get it right its awesome ... one of my favorite purchases recently 
hot air while the meat or food product sits on a wire mesh . there 's no oil and the heat from the air cooks the product through and through . 
i really do n't know those specs rather than to say it plugs into a regular wall socket . hope that helps . 
shipping through us is currently free ! 
i have no idea what the weight limit is , but have incredibly heavy dishes - and lots of them on each shelf ! absolutely no particle board ! i would buy it again and again and again - it honestly looks like a piece of furniture you 'd buy in an upscale furniture store . no one believes i bought this piece on line ! 
it 's a very rich brian with red undertones 
my son actually built it - he said it took about an hour and was n't too hard . he is 24 and quite mechanically inclined . the cabinet is really good quality and looks great . 
the exact volume of the glass is two cups . that is to the very lip of the bowl . the lid will not go on at this volume . you can put about 1.5 cups and still put on the lid . otherwise , these seal very well , and i 'm happy i purchased . 
no 
these are statements from the anchor hocking website for the trueseal products : oven safe : use your anchor hocking bakeware in gas and electric ovens up to 425. freezer safe : use your anchor hocking ware for storing food in refrigerator or freezer , but do not take directly from freezer to oven . let food thaw before cooking or reheating in oven . 
they will stack for storage but i do it three and three because stacking all 6 would be very wobbly . they do n't fit inside each other as they are all the same size . 
the lid is silicone 
yes , i have used them in the freezer and they are fine 
10 '' x9 '' # 9 '' high 
that and a lot more than what you have listed . extremely roomy with lots of pockets . got this for my granddaughter for her freshman year in college . i could n't believe how versatile this caddy is and extremely well made . 
the shower caddy is all netting . it will not stand on it 's own when empty . if it is loaded with your shampoo , etc . it will should stand , depending on how it 's loaded . it 's perfect for a dorm or if you are sharing a bathroom . 
no the strap does not fit over your shoulder once you put all your accessories in it , but the caddy is large enough for everything you need for the shower and more . 
yes ! just make sure you roll it up a little bit . the towel may peek out a little from the top but it should n't be too much over the edge . 
it 's definitely sturdy and i have n't had a problem with them tipping yet ! 
well , i 've never actually brought it with me into the shower , i just use it to carry things to the shower ( i live in a dorm with community bathrooms ) but the black mesh part does not absorb water at all . the pink part will but i 'm sure it wo n't take long to dry . 
with the quality of this product , i do n't believe you will have that problem . it is extremely well made and unless you overstuff it ( which i do n't believe will be necessary ) it should n't rip at all . my suggestion is to keep the information you receive with the caddy and contact the manufacturer if you have any problem . 
yes it is according to me . it carried my hair blow dryer along with my shampoo+conditioner , body wash , face wash , brush , comb & wash clothes . 
when the handle is pressed to hold the fruit , the machine turns its power on automatically . 
no you can not , the orange , lemon and grapefruit are the only fruits that you can press with this machine . i have this machine for almost 2 years and i use it regularly pressing the citrus fruits and it works awesome . i hope this help . 
plastic and metal however the plastic seems untouched by citrus . 
1 year , but returned mine for a refund after the 1st use . motor overheats juicing more than 6 oranges at a time and has to cool about 20 min . before continuing . you would be so much better off with a cuisinart pulp control juicer - excellent machine , this one is cheap and not good for a family . 
85 watts . works great 
we sent it back , not what i wanted 
i always wash it by hand as it cleans up quite easily . i would imagine if you put the parts on the top shelf only it would be alright . 
no 
i have not tried any lines but have juiced some small lemons . the juicer comes with two inserts , small and large . so i do not think it would be an issue . 
yes but broke easily order the cuisinart citrus juicer 
no . it is plastic . 
i handwash mine . i do n't believe they are dishwasher safe . 
i believe it 's made by a company by the name of gfg . 
i have no idea . 
i threw away the box but they are tin -- -made exactly like mason jars but with a hole for the straw . 
no they do n't 
the size of your typical straw , i do not think that this would be big enough . 
the red one looks like a deep orange . if that works for you . 
yes . the asin is b00mnh7740 
4 '' x 12 '' 
yes , it could arrive usually within two weeks . can you let us know the exact date of your performance ? so that we could know how to serve you better . 
hi m. brady , the hourglass does stand on its own . thanks , customer service team 
the height of the hourglass is 11.5 inches , and the width at the largest area is 4 inches . hope that helps : ) 
plugs into the unit directly . there is a plug on the back of the wine opener . 
well - the bottle tends to spin with the motion of the opener . you would need some way to secure the bottle so it would n't spin . if you did that , it could be done with one hand . 
i 've had mine for almost 6 months now and so far still holding strong ! 
you have to get the correct ac adapter 
on the adapter is reads , 120v ac 60hz 50ma ... ..hope that helps . 
it comes with a power cord when pluged into both the wine opener and an electrical outlet charges the unit . it will then open approximately 60 bottles on that charge . you should not leave it pluged in all the time as that will over charge the battery and ruin it . 
i have used it with the plastic corks with no problem 
hi - to retrieve the cork , simply push the button on top . it 's surprising how fast it comes off . i hope this helps . 
yes , it comes with an ac adapter , which has a headphone like plug which you use to charge the opener . 
i would call them winter white , not bright white . certainly not cream . they are very nice . 
yes 
yes it does . 
24 '' 
the legs are dark brown , like espresso . 
counter height i believe 60. do n't get bad quality 
mine do n't get a lot of use , but they 're holding up perfectly . 
cream colored 
yes i pipe my frosting pretty high and it worked great . 
hi ! i apologize for the delay.. but this item has 10 per pack . 
the jumbo size papers work perfect in these . the bottom is 2 '' . not sure of actual heighth , but i made awesome jumbo muffins for christmas giving . the container showed them so great . know i will reorder sometime in the near future . 
these containers of a jumbo muffins cupcakes ... standard size may fall over 
i have only used it for salt and pepper , but ca n't see why you ca n't used other spices . the grinding heads are ceramic and adjustable to grind size . i do n't know how much it holds , at a guess around 3 to 4 tablespoons . 
yes . you can adjust your pepper and or salt great invention ! 
piece of cake . top section is easly removible . 
have n't noticed that . like it so much , purchased a second for a vacation home 
yes they are it works great 
no . plastic of some sort . 
i use the celtic sea salt which i bought thru amazon & i use the tri-peppercorns which i buy at world market . i 'm sure you could order it thru amazon as well . i love this salt peppercorn grinder & i have tried many thru the years ... 
it is sea salt which is a coarse but a wonderful salt for cooking . you could possibly try morton iodized salt but you would only need a salt shaker not a grinder for that . 
7-1 3 '' 
i cleaned it before i put the salt and pepper in and i jut put soapy water in and shook it . i think you would need a little brush to get any build up off the sides . 
14 1 2 x 18 7 8 
just got it this past christmas and only the rack required assembly . i did not know until i opened box , however i must say putting the rack together was very , very , easy . 
the metal goes the entire width of the table and is anchored at both ends . 
yes . but one of the tables broke right away . the rest are fine . 
i 'm sorry i do not have them in black 
from the floor to table top is approximately 26 '' . 
no , they were a gift and i got to see them and they were beautiful . they loved them and they are not the set that they are selling in the stores . 
they are very well made and are over 3 '' 4 '' thick . ! they are made to last through the years abd we have really ebjoyed ours . 
it 's boards of real wood ( white pine ? ) that have been glued together and shaped and sanded . they are sturdy and look fine for casual use . 
well they fit into a grooved spot and do n't collapse if you move carefully but they do n't really lock . 
yess..it will work 
carla , my mixer is the `` artisan '' tilt back head mixer . unless you have the large professional mixer with the arms that hold the bowl then the cover should fit yours . mine came with the standard stainless steel bowl and i bought a glass 5 quart bowl also . i love this cover , it has a zipper that makes it easy to put on and fits like a glove . 
no ! 
just perfect 
yes it will fit . same mixer just a different series of colors . 
good place to keep the booklet that comes with the kitchen aid but can also hold a couple of the mixing attachments . 
the mixer i bought is a k45ss , it 's the only number i have since it came from a consignment shop and i do n't have a box or any paperwork . the cover does fit and i 'm able to close the zipper in the back . i hope this helps . 
your kitchen aid looks very similar to mine and should definitely fit . i can measure my mixer and advise , if you like ! 
i think it will 
if it is a tilt back type and not a lift type 
nope . this unit fit on a tilt head 5qt model only per i.e ksm150ps models . thanks 
i have the prof 6000 from costco . the bowl is more narrow than the other professionals and taller . it would n't fit mine . if you check out kitchen aids website , you can ask their customer service people . they are pretty helpful . 
yes 
if you have a mixer that does not have a long handle to bring the bowl up and down , than yes , it should fit . 
your kitchenaid model k45sswh appears to be the approximate same model as the kitchenaid i have , as i compared the descriptions , this cover fits our mixer perfectly . all i can say , is if it does not fit and you are buying through amazon , there will be no problem of returning the cover if you are not satisfied . although , again , i believe your model is the same size as the model i have . the height of my kitchenaid mixer is a little over 14 inches . 
yes . it will work for that model . 
yes ! and keeps clean my mixer . 
no it will not . 
the kitchenaid stand mixer i own is the artisan series tilt head and this cover fits perfectly . i am unsure of watts . hope this helps . 
i 'm not sure ... .i have tilthead and it fits on mine ... 
14 1 2 '' tall by 15 '' wide . 6 inches across the base . the handles are long enough to put on your shoulder , and the zipper across the top stops things falling out . they also have a pocket on the outside which is where i usually put my book when i am travelling for easy access . they are far more durable than a normal shopping bag . 
they are very lightweight ! ! the bags fold up to about the size of a small clutch- and snap shut . all contained and perfect for on-the-go ! put k37652 in the search box on the q v c website for a video ! 
approx 16 '' l x 7 '' w x 15 '' h- the strap drop is 11 '' 
i had mine monogrammed and they looked great and held up just fine ! 
they fold into a neat packet with a snap . these bags are the best ... .really thick , and keep groceries frozen the whole way home - even in summer ! 
the outer shell is made of nylon , and the inner shell is a silver insulated material , so they are really easy to clean . these are awesome bags , and i ca n't tell you how many grocery checkers ( and others ) comment on how great the bags are ! i highly recommend them ! 
i do n't know if there is an established weight limit , but i have carried some pretty heavy loads - 2 2-liter bottles of soda plus 2 large bottles of cranberry juice plus assorted small items in one bag - with no problem . 
it says they are in stock 
yes they do , i love mine . i had beef blood drip , no problem ! 
44 in . wide , 30 1 4-in . high , 20 in . deep 
it 's not high quality materials - it 's particle board basically . the top is finished exactly like the rest of it . 
installed during assembly ... . wood corners would have to taken apart and reglued 
you can leave it out . 
the top is mdf laminated with a heavy papery wood looking finish . it is pretty durable . the sides are multiple materials . the corner pieces appear to be wood . the x side support is also either wood or mdf . the backing behind the x piece is really a heavy cardboard type material laminated like the top . my unit does n't get heavy use so it works well . it looks very nice for the price . it would not do well with heavy use because the ding and dent factor would be prohibitive . 
there are 2 shelves ; they are approximately 19 '' long and 16 '' wide . keep in mind that the manufacturer places a 'sticker ' of some kind right on the top and when you take it off it takes off the finish . nice , huh ? 
it 's dark brown 
it comes with all the hardware you will need . they include some extra and everything is nicely labeled . various sized hardware is included for mounting your tv as well . 
41w x 21.5d x 52.5h . but , the height can be adjusted some by moving adjusting the tv mount . 
yes 
i put mine in a corner of the room and there is plenty of swivel room . if concerned about it simply do n't place the stand so close to the wall . physical size of the tv will effect this factor also . 
it is eliptical , but at it 's widest , it is 33 '' by 15 '' , and can probably hold about 30 to 45 pounds rather safely , they are tempered glass , and i have put a lot of things on them , with no issues 
should work . it 's more about weight . mine is 46 '' . they also want to under rate for safety . 
i just have a berber carpet in basement where i have the stand- but it 's very stable . you can adjust the front legs to level out- the glass is heavy enough to keep it stable also . 
there 's multiple holes on the mounting hardware . what 're the dimensions of the speaker ? 
yes , it will hold 50 inch , but check with seller first . 
the actual tv mount can be removed and not used , however the vertical support is one piece floor to top so it must be used . 
i have a 47 inch screen that is 26.75 '' tall and there is 14.5 '' of space from the bottom of my t.v . to the top glass shelf . 
this is a tv stand ; not a tv . it was not double boxed when i received it . 
the stand can support the tv on its own . it does not need to be attached to a wall . however , current tv 's are tall , thin , and potentially unstable . if the tv is sitting on the shelving , it might be prudent to use a wire cable to attach it to the vertical pole or wall to keep it from getting knocked over . 
22 '' 
the cables can be run in the middle vertical column . anything on the shelves will have the cables freely out behind it , but they may be routed up to the tv through the column if that makes sense . i 'm pretty happy with how it worked out on mine . 
about 32-33 inches . 
i did not give that answer , i have a 40 '' tv mounted on the bracket and it is 13 1 2 inches from the top of the top shelf to the bottom of the tv . 
just one box like you would pick up in a store . very well packed though 
3ft using the stand but it can be hung any height from the wall . i like using the stand . so far , no problems . 
yes it swivels 
no it 's 48 inches high , make time to assemble ! ! ! looks great 
very compact for all the space it provides . basically it 's 4 feet in height , less than 2 feet sticking out from the wall and just over 2 feet lengthwise 
we currently have a 40 '' on it , however it is only 16 lbs ! not sure about 35lbs ! 
yes 
yes 
14 '' deep x 18 '' wide ... yes 
the lower 4 shelves are 20 '' wide the top shelf is 27 '' 
i have it in front of me and it measures exactly 48 '' to the top of the highest shelf . i think it says this in the ad , and can confirm that . 
12 '' and if you can turn it sideways and then stand it up ( there is a bar frame about .5 '' wide ) then you would get about 12.75 '' . 
15by27 inches 
yes . i attached a headboard and footboard for my daughters bed 
yes 
yes 
not this one . this extends length not width 
i believe so , as long as there are holes drilled in the rails of the bed frame that match up ; otherwise you will need to drill holes in the rails . our bed frame had the headboard plates all ready attached , but not for the foot board . 
they extend far enough to be able to attach a footboard . i had a great bedframe , however it did n't allow me to attach a footboard . this adapted it perfectly ! 
the footboard kit is only available as pictured - with the bolt on style brackets . however , you can easily combine this footboard kit with a set of hook conversion brackets , such as the bed claw # 35 or # 69 brackets which you can find on amazon . this will allow you to attach a hook-on style footboard . 
the slots on the footboard mounting bracket are between 1 4 and 5 16 ( 9 32 ) . i would say it will work taking into account the thread depth of your bolts . worse case is to file the slot or drill it out to accommodate your 5 16 bolt . 
i have n't had any trouble with cleaning . once the reservoir is removed , there 's easy access to clean everything with a paper towel . 
made in taiwan 
no , nothing but water and they dont even like water with heavy minerals 
hi lin , that 's unusual . i use it everyday and it does n't even damp the books i put on the nightstand . 
outside of unit , no ... not at all . inside ... .not my experience . i use reverse osmosis water only . about once every month the `` slime factor '' inside the tank starts to build up . i use one of three or four methods to clean it . using only one of four possible cleaners : straight bleach ( wear safety glasses ) , ammonia , tri-sodium phosphate , or mouthwash . i start with what ever i have close and if the inside of the unit does n't feel squeaky clean i 'll try something else . i run this thing 24 7. i assume the if you take off the fill cap and allow it to dry periodically you 'd have the same results . or , use vinegar . i failed to mention that method . cleaning strength vinegar ... ..my first method . this almost always works . i assume if you have well water or impurities you 'll face more challenges . i really like the unit and it remains very durable . good luck . 
your unit is out of water . lift the cover , turn it over , remove the fill cap , fill the reservoir with distiller water , put the cap back in place , then put the cover back on the unit and turn it back on . 
no 
no ... and my wife has a very keen sense of smell ( which drives me crazy at times ) . the roolen is 2 feet from her side of the bed and she has found no problems whatsoever . 
i found that once a week seemed to be enough . that was for a good scrubbing not a brief rinse . every day is a bit over the top . 
yes 
all most 2 '' cubes 
4 ounces for one cube . 24 ounces for the whole tray . 
yes , they stack nicely in the freezer . great ice cube trays , love them ! 
i have no idea , peter . i would think the silicone formulaused to manufacture these ice trays could be the same similar to manufacture the baking cups used for cupcakes and other kindred baking products . however , err on the side of caution when considering to expose this product to high temperatures , as in an oven . better to use this product for the purpose intended , unless you can obtain some definitive advice from the manufacturer . hope this helps a little . good luck and happy new year . 
i 'm sorry , paula , but i have no idea . i do love them , and plan to buy more . good luck . louise . 
no they are about 1.4 x 1.4. they are awesome 
1.9 x 1.9 
alen units are not rated by cadr . please see http : www.alencorp.com articles cadr.asp i am really pleased with the unit and can tell a difference in my allergies and breathing . i used this site to help me decide : http : www.air-purifiers-america.com product.asp ? product=t500 if there are certain pollutants you are looking to reduce , alen makes special filters . for example : the t500 includes a hepa-pure filter , making it perfect for those who have allergy or dust concerns . if you have more specific concerns , alen has other filter options including : hepa-fresh ( allergens and light odor ) , hepa-silver ( mold and bacteria ) , hepa-odorcell ( smoke and heavy odor ) . hope this helps ! 
the label on the unit reads `` made in china '' . 
i am using it in florida and seems to help so far . 
this was on the alen corp website : http : www.alencorp.com collections alen-t500-product-line products alen-t500-tower-hepa-air-purifier power supply : this is a 120v product . it is only safe to operate in in north america and not in countries with 220-240v power supply 
no 
there is a separate button for ion function . 
this unit can help to remove cigarette smoke when paired with its hepa-odorcell filter . we would recommend to purchase these together so you will have the best option to help remove the lingering odor . keep in mind , these units will only work in the space that they are in . we recommend that when you receive your unit , take out the basic filter that comes with the unit and put in the hepa-odorcell and turn the unit on high for a couple of hours to allow max air flow . if you have any further questions , please let us know . thank you for choosing alen as your clean air provider and have a great day . 
press the botton used to select the amount of time for it to stay on . if you ca n't reach the outlet you might be better off with a regular light timer set to turn on and off by itself . 
i can not see why it would not work as long as you can live with the specific hourly time restrictions of 8 , 4 , 2 , or 1 hours . you can not work with minutes , i.e . 2 hours and 30 minutes . being rated at 15 amps , i can not imagine your overloading the unit in your application . my wife uses ours two or three times a week and we have not had a problem . so i think they have built a good unit . 
this is a completely electronic timer , no moving parts , thus no noise . it has a maximum current handling capacity of 15 amps continuous duty . 
hello , i love the timer . i use it all the time on my bedside light to help me stop reading and get some sleep ! : - ) hope this helped . 
are you sure that you are setting the timer to the correct shutoff time ? one press of the button turns the switch on indefinitely . a second press of the button sets the timer to one hour . check the lights on the timer panel to make sure that you are setting it properly . if you are setting it properly and it still does n't shut off it must be defective . 
you plug it in a normal outlet . you can only have timer go to constant on , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 hrs . 
works great ! 
no , it does not 
yes , it is ul approved 
yes 
assuming it 's just getting on and off , i think it should be ok. i 've been using it as a daily bed since i got it and it 's done rather nicely . i would n't let a small child use it as a trampoline , however . 
queen ! ! ! 
i bought a twin size 
janice , folded i measured approx : 24 x 18 x 8 inches 
do n't know the exact weight but feels like 15- 20 pounds inflated . 
i purchased the queen size version but i do believe there is a full size version . the dimension of the full size version i do not know . do you want the dimensions of the queen size version ? 
they are both correct . whichever color you purchase , you will get the design pictured . 
14.25 '' length x 12.75 '' width x 5.51 '' heights 
china . thank you . 
i have had mine a while and it has n't rusted yet . i have very hard water too , idk how that contributes to rust if any . 
slots are raised and good for plates big and small 
you can certainly make yogurt using the square rutes dehydrator ! in fact , the square cube-shape of the unit allows for many sized jars to be used to make yogurt . 
yes , the 21 '' does include the handle . the depth is 18 and 3 4 '' front to back , but it does need some room for the vent fan to `` breathe '' on the back ( center ) and for the cord ( not a 90 degree install ) . i would say you need 20 '' to the front . 
we 've made some more complex recipes like dehydrated chili and so forth . you might want to get a thermometer for it if you need an exact temperature , but we 're really happy with it . what sorts of recipes are you planning to make ?

the unit comes with food grade stainless steel 1 4 '' hole shelving , which works great for dehydrating any kind of fruit or veggie slices . if you are making fruit leathers , raw cookies , or anything that starts out as a liquid you would need to purchase sheets . silicone sheets can be purchased on our website . or you can use baking parchment paper : ) 
hello , thank you for your question . our dehydrators are warrantied against faulty workmanship and defects for 1 year from purchase . our dehydrators will be repaired or replaced at discretion of raw rutes , llc . 
the fan is located along the rear wall of the unit . the noise level is quieter than most of our stainless steel competitors we tested against . we have noticed that some of the plastic units may be slightly quieter , but by design they are less efficient at removing moisture . honestly , to the average ear , it would n't even be noticeable : ) the best way i can describe it is as a low hum . 
i have had a 50 inch flat screen tv on it for the past 6 months and have n't had any problem . it 's pretty stable and i have n't seen any skewing when having to slide it to dust . 
yes 
particle board top with wood sides , painted black . it is fairly sturdy ! 
dimensions are 15-3 4 '' d x 23-1 2 '' w x 5 '' h 
roughly 22 inches from inside edge to inside edge . 
it fits underneath the top board , midway , and attaches to inside of both side pieces to secure it . like a midpoint brace . 
yes 
no . 
hi ... hopefully i wo n't confuse you . i measured both outside the boards and inside . the outside measured 23.5 '' wide , 5.5 '' tall and a little more than 15 '' from front to back ... inside : about 4.5 '' from the brace inside to the table surface ... ( add 1-1.5 '' ) if you do n't need more than say 7 '' of your underneath or the unit you place under is small enough to clear the bracing bar . hope this helps ... : ) my blue ray player is small enough it fits under with a lot of room to spare . ( the inside width measured about 22.5 '' ) 
16 inches 
36 inches x 15.5 inches x 36 inches ; 57 pounds 
mdf ( medium-density fibreboard ) 
behind the doors the height is about 20 inches , so putting the shelf in the middle would probably give you enough space to put books . the hole for the cord is n't that big and there is a circle piece that you can put in there that would make it less open . i could n't figure out how to put it in but it did n't matter for what i was using it for . it is sturdy and heavier than i thought it would be . 
my tv is a 42 '' and it is flush with either side . your pedestal would probably fit fine but you 'd have nearly 5 '' on either side , so stability might be an issue . 
yes enough room for , tv and vcr 
approx . 31 x 20 x 13 ( h , l , w ) . basically you can put dvd 's on each self 2 deep . the legs are short , about 3 inches from bottom of cabinet to floor . 
i do n't see why not other than having holes where the hinges would be . but why buy this lovely piece when you can find others that do not have the doors 
34 w x 14.5 d x 36 h. the table top is slightly larger measuring 36 x 15.5 . 
the unit is 36 '' high x 36 '' wide x 15.5 '' deep . 
yes . 
the lid is the only difference . the one with lid is just a special sale price . 
i 've always found gas to be better ( more controllable and hotter ) , but i 'm using mine with a 30 year old jenn-air and it cooks wonderfully ! 
`` oven safe up to 500 degrees f. do not use under broiler '' 
the bottom of the inside is 9 '' wide , the top is just over 12 '' wide 
did you use a cooking spray on it before you used it . that 's not good . it can cause stains that are very difficult to remove and clean . a scouring pad should do the job with some soap . barkeep 's friend should certainly help . if all fails use an sos pad . 
easily up to 750f as most ovens never get that hot , no problem . all clad and calphalon are pans most of us chefs use . they have lifetime warranties and they will hold up to anything . i have seen these pans heated up to 750f and then thrown into a ice bath with no effect . hope that helps ... . 
no , this pan has an all stainless-steel interior . they do sell non-stick pans but this model is n't one of them . 
the one i have is 3-ply but i believe they have now come out with 5-ply . i have a 3 ply 10 '' without a cover and a 12 '' with a cover and i love them both ! 
yes , i have induction heating . 
not sure . check their website 
its not a set , its 1 . 
it can hold at least 25lbs . 
90 mil 
its recycle code is 2 hdpe ( high-density polyethylene ) . hope that helps . 
no lid came with 
12 x 14 id 
i had 12 plates in mine and they did fine . 
it holds any dinner plates up to about 11 1 2 inches . but there is about a 20 lbs weight limit . i use it allot for patio parties with paper plates . i gave one for a gift , for the money its a great caddy , just used it this weekend for a party of 40 with paper products . 
the napkin holders dimensions are : 6 1 4 x 6 1 4 with a depth of 3 1 4 '' deep . 
it can take the small size napkins and not the larger dinner plate napkins - unless you tri-fold them 
i just measured and it is right at 11 1 2 then goes down to 10. if you did stack some , it would only be a couple . i hope this helps ! 
no . it all came in one piece . there are some screws under the utencil cups , but do n't know if you can take it apart . 
i never counted , but it held enough for 25 people at our cookout and was n't full 
i had a 9 1 4 inch square plate that fit fine . i also put a sheet of 11 '' x 8.5 '' sheet of paper in the area , and that fit , so if that styrofoam plate is the size of a sheet of paper , they should fit . there is a circle that normal round plates sit in , but i do not think that will cause a problem , just that with a hard jolt , someone could knock the plates off center . 
the cady holds 9 inch plates 
yes you can and that is what i did , i unscrewed the top and slid it into the middle careful w the screws , they are small and i lost one lol 
if you meant that you were having trouble attaching the seat to the arms ( already attached to the chair back ) then i would suggest try putting the seat on first . if you meant that you were having trouble attaching the seat to the base via the screws ... ..well . make sure you are using the longer screws for this task . the directions have a mistake and usually make you attach the chair back to the arms with the wrong ( longest ) screws . use the longest screws and line it up . it might take some doing but you should be able to position it correctly . try screwing one screw a little first , and then going diagonally across to the other side and screwing another in partially . then connect the other two and tighten evenly to prevent it from damaging the screw slots . thats the best advice i have for you . if you cant manage that , maybe let someone else do it ( ooh , like maybe someone you are angry at . that would be pretty good punishment . and they might even be able to do it lol ) . 
mine spans 22 inches across so i do n't know where they get 18 '' ? 
no 
i have no idea , ,mine was stolen outside my door before i ever got it , , 
it 's a brown gray . it looks grayer in the photo than it looks in real life . 
the blanket has the markings of origin being an old mwswap nato europe conventional secondary distributal . i believe its a euonato french bucket bundlement . these can be made in northern europe or canada and then recontracted back out to thailand malaysia so on so forth . its a legitimate second bundlements blanket , i like it for the price . its not 100 % wool , its 70 % wool and polyester . its pretty good deal for the price . i can not guarantee the quality of course as they are actual resurplus issue . that 's something to keep in mind . i use these for my dogs , the beach , and the best true utility blanket . there really not that bad . the stink when you first get them . just spray them with disinfectant aerosol and then tide freebreeze linen softener . 
the first week i own the blanket yes there was a small order but it went away after a little while 
a reproduction of the real thing one of our most sought after blanket around these days as featured in sunset magazine and country living ( june 2011 ) ! made of 80 % wool and 20 % nylon measure approximately 60 '' x 80 '' it has a beautiful white embroidered cross inside the red line with a blanket stitch along the edges 
i would order the king - my pillows are 31 long with an average loft and i have a bit of room . but queen sounds def . too small . 
there is one per package 
you may have washed it i too hot water or had bleach in the wash. i was mine on delicate and warm water and use ivory snow . it is still perfect . patrishe 
yes 
i machine wash mine . it 's not as soft but i just ca n't own something like that if it ca n't be machine washed . 
good morning . most of our customers have had no issues machine washing using the gentle or hand wash cycle . line or lay flat to dry - slight touch up with a steam iron ( if needed ) and they look great ! i am a single dad with 2 boys and use them on my bed . i have had no issues washing them - the ironing part i plead the fifth ! have a wonderful weekend . craig fishers finery customer service 
mine measures approximately 28 x 19.5 inches . 
the case is larger than the average queen pillowcase . i use it on a pure dunlopillo pillow that is thick and full . the case fit generously . 
no 
i imagine it is silk thread . i ca n't tell you i 'm 100 % certain . however , these pillow cases have withstood my two german shepherds , one golden retriever & a cat jumping around & playing on my bed with no freys or tares . 
i 'm not sure , i ordered a burgandy one . 
we use only 100 % mulberry silk ! 
neither look wrinkled . i personally like the gray one better . 
they are 100 % silk and made in china . 
i do not know . 
the manual does n't say anything about the machine `` turning off , '' it merely says `` red light indicates that water bottle needs to be refilled . '' but , crane humidifier representatives say that their animal-shaped humidifiers turn `` off '' when they run out of water , even though the red light is still on . so , i think it 's reasonable to expect that other manufacturers have likewise designed their humidifiers so the mechanism stops running when the water supply runs out . my miso humidifier often stays empty-but-on for a while before i get around to turning it off and it 's still operating fine . once the red light switches on it 's as quiet as as when it 's all the way off . just make sure you turn it off and empty it all the way out if you 're not actively using it for a while . 
no i checked and it is strictly an electrical plug in . 
it never will work , like mine never would . return it while you can . 
i do n't use a filter with mine ... . i do n't think it needs one . one peeve is that it does n't fit all water bottles . mostly your cheap generic nestle type bottles . dasani and smart do n't fit 
i do n't see how . it is very compact and the adapters do n't look like it 
in the usa , 120 volt ac is converted by the transformer on the wire that plugs into the outlet to 24 volt dc . 
yes- and it comes with a little cleaning brush that lets you reach all the little crevices . 
dry eyes is one reason i purchased it for my office at work . my eyes have been watering for several hours in the morning , which can be caused by dry air . i have only used this unit for one week so do n't know the results yet , but it certainly ca n't hurt since it will add moisture to the air . 
i do n't know . i hope you can . i would try to get in touch with the company who makes it . good luck . 
one water bottle last as close to 6 hours or more . i think about the size of the one on the picture . probably 16oz . ? 
no but it was pretty easy to put together ! 
hard to say , it depends what you want to put on it . the wheels are kind of flimsy , but the real issue is that the sleeves that prop up , pop out and collapse too easily . whenever i move the cart they fall down . if you wanted to put something heavier on the center section it could probably hold it . what are you looking to use it for ? 
the top with the leaves folded down is 14.5 '' x 14.5 '' . 
i would n't put more than 15 to 20 lbs on it they are not real sturdy if you plan on rolling it around much . it works great for what i purchased it for 
eating a snack yes , having an entire meal , i would n't recommend . it 's not very sturdy so not sure how much wear and tear it could handle . 
maybe 15 or 20 lbs 
not too short , but not the sturdiest . i have had it fall apart on me already . the wheels could n't handle any weight and broke within the first few days . the drawers on it do not stay on and also can not handle any weight . i will be purchasing a new one once i move . spend a bit more for better ... 
yes 
i purchased it several months ago and have been really happy with the quality . i have a large microwave and other items bottles etc on it and have had no problems at all . 
i do n't know yet , i got on of the few left before they sold out . i always go into these projects hopeful ... we 'll see . i 'll update when i have tackled the assembly 
it 's easier to slide them down the rod . i 've had mine for a few months and already they are beginning to rust , so i would spray them down with rust protectant before you use them . 
i 've had these for a couple of years - they are covered in rust 
very easy to put on and take off rod . slide easily . i have both a liner and curtain on each hook . hooks are very easy to work with . 
the ones that i bought were polished chrome . 
i do n't think so . my rod is slightly over 1 in . and that looks to be the ideal size . the actual diameter is 1.5 by getting them on would be difficult and they would n't be able to move freely . 
mine are installed on a plastic rod , but i have similar ones ousted mine are installed on a plastic rod , but i have similar ones on a metal rod . the little balls roll across the rod and i do n't hear a screech on the metal one . is there a place where the ring touches the rod other than where the little balls travel ? 
i think they spin but they ca n't move down , they are stuck together 
they are polished chrome 
no . this is actually the second set i 've owned - the first was lost in my last move . they hold up beautifully . 
304 stainless will not rust . i believe the difference basically is that one is alloyed with nickel the other with chromium.chromium alloys are much whiter . 
i 'm not sure but it does produced some smell if you are 2 square feet from the area not whole a lot because o3 is very unstable . it evaporates right away . 
hi julia , i personally do n't drink the ozonated type water ; however i am also not going to say i 'm for or against drinking this type of water . i have spent time , money and practiced drinking `` ionized water '' , it seems to be essentially going after the same outcome : reduce free radicals in the body . that part i 'm wholeheartedly on board with . i did a youtube search , sure enough , there is a good video on a guy making ozonated water . i 've coped and pasted the link for you : https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=b-bdhv4kcf8 
o3 is poisonous . you do not want to breathe it in.. 
i 've been using it to ozonate water to drink and i 've also used it for purifying various rooms in my home . i 'm very happy with this product . i 'm not sure if it does something to ph or not , i have n't checked . 
it work at 110v electricity , not 220v . 
this item was returned . the instructions were lacking enough information . 
it will not help you remove cigarette odor . 
it does ozonate water , but not oil . 
your dimensions are the correct ones , 26.18 wide 11.62 deep and 15,37 height . these are great ! i 've got them in the 2-tier and 3-tier , i 'll buy more of the 3-tier because they clear my husband dress shirts and slacks and there 's enough room under for flip flops & slippers , almost like having 4 rows . 
no . i tried to stack it on the 3-tier shoe rack and failed . there 's about 0.3 inch gap between those two shoe racks . 
no , they ca n't . each side frame is a single piece , with slots for the two racks . 
the clearance from the floor to the underside of the first shelf is 6.25 '' . the shelf thickness is about .25 '' . the clearance between the second shelf and the underside of the top shelf is about the same , about 6.13. all ample size for good visibility . boots would have to go on the top shelf . the overall dimensions of the unit are 26.25 '' wide , 11.75 '' deep and 15 '' tall . i use this unit for on the floor , versus the three shelf unit that i believe they suggest as the base unit . 
do n't buy it , terribly constructed . breaks easily . 
no you can not remove..look at other choices 
they stack 2 or 3 high . you should have received connectors and screws ( low quality ) . 
they will fit just fine you can fit three pairs of high top tennis shoes on each level 
this unit is a dark brown , we do not have balck available . thank you ! 
i would not advise it . 
57 inches ( width ) x 80 inches ( height ) thank you 
it is 110v version 
yes , it is fully 110v . i have had the mattress for about two weeks and it is awesome ! 
30 - 36 c 
it 's hard to notice if they are different . feels same . 
hi , amazon shipping states 10 - 15 days , but we ship almost same day as we get order in . and only takes 3-5 days depends on where you are . new jersey , 1-2 days , california 4-5 days . thank you , 
yes , they claim they are the first company in korea to offer such feature . as you can see from the picture , it has the dual zone control you 're seeking . 
i heard that too . but this one is quiet . most of the time , no sound at all . rarely i hear small air mix like sound . 
hi , we have m twin bed size which we call it single ( because there is only one control to control tempature ) , size is 46 inches width x 78 inches long for queen bed size which we call it double ( because there are two controller control tempature on each side ) , size is 56 inches width x 79 inches long if you have any other question , feel free to ask . recently , 180 units of these sold to ski house in vermont . feel how cozy this is and you will never use bed without onsu mat ! 
no , we do not have king size . however most of users are satisfy with queens size mat . when you put it on king size bed , it covers 85 % which should be enough to accommodate two people comfortably also king size will have issue with distribution of heat . therefore queen size is very good size to use . we have not received any size issue selling queens size over 8 years . 
hello heather , yes , there is a 1 year warranty on parts and material defects on the dehydrator . 
hello heather , we carry a silicone mat that can be purchased through our website . it is not available on amazon at this time . it is perfect for fruit leathers and other similar projects . 
hello heather , thanks for the question . the stainless steel trays and racks that hold them remove from the dehydrating chamber leaving an easy to wipe down surface with no brackets or edges . those trays and racks may be placed in a dishwasher or sink , however the whole unit should not under any circumstances be put in a dishwasher or sink . there are many electrical parts and components present . 
i wash mine in the sink with a little woolite & downy.hang to dry . it does n't take long 
it is a generous 20 x 30 inches . 
i would suggest the king . i have the king on my pillows that are 35+ '' long . very happy with the quality . 
i do n't recall what was written on the package , but i just checked my pillowcase and the label sewn on the inside says `` 100 % silk '' . 
i do n't know ... ..the tag tells me that it is 100 % silk made in china . they suggest either dry clean or wash in cold water on a gentle cycle . i hope this will help . 
the tag reads `` 100 % silk '' . you 'd have to ask the manufacturer if that is synonymous with 100 % mulberry silk . 
no 
25mm is denser , therefore it may `` appare '' harder ... it will become softer with time , and it will last longer 
i do n't know because i bought king size but they are big enough so i assume the queen 's would be too . they are excellent quality . 
william , i only bought the king sized . the length is 33 '' and the width is 19 '' . do not know about the other sizes . they are wonderful so good luck ! 
yes it is.. but you can still use it . it will be slightly larger.. it wo n't be a snug fit but it 's not that much of a deal but for a truly great fit i suggest you go buy a queen size pillow i think you would be happier . 
they are 2036 . 
no , satin has a rayon feel to it . this pillowcase is very soft and stays cool against my face which i really love . 
more of an ivory cream . 
i 'm pretty sure the dimensions are there under description at the bottom 
i really do n't know , but they are the same size as all my other pillow covers . 
dear eureka publishing , thank you for your inquiry . we will have king sizes available within a week . fishers finery 
single . 
no . there are only certain products made that specifically say will reduce dust mites , allergens etc . you have to look for pillows and pillow covers that say this . however , if you put your pillows on high heat in dryer you can reduce and possibly kill certain allergens . if you think you have a big problem with dust mites or anything else that is a problem it 's probably best to replace pillows and mattress if older than 8 years . 
the pillowcase is 30 '' long and 20 '' wide . it has an envelope closure . made in china 
no . it is not made of down . it is a down alternative . much better for my allergies and i could n't be happier with the softness and comfort ! : ) hope this helps ! 
it was too hot for me . it 's not noticeable when you first lay down , but by the morning i started waking up repeatedly from the warmth . i tried to move around but any spot i moved too got too warm after 10 mins . 
we bought this topper hoping it would offset the sagging in our mattress . initially it felt great , like we were sleeping on clouds . but after a few nights , that effect went away and the sinks in the mattress are evident again . however , it could be because my husband and i both heavy , we may have flattened it : ) 
no.. extra plush double thick is the thickest and plushiest size . ( ( trust me i checked the website & # 128513 ; ) ) 
sandy , the extra plush and extra thick pad is approximately 2.5 inches thick and is indeed a mattress topper . when laying on it , it will compress , but will still offer a great deal of comfort and support . please let us know if you have any additional questions , we 'd love to help ! thank you ! -brett es customer service 
check out the `` weight '' between the two . i 'm looking at a twin topper and the bamboo extra plush is 7.2 lbs in weight whereas the `` extra double thick extra plush shipping weight , for the same `` twin '' is 10.6 lbs . that should be a clue as to which has more `` stuffing `` or loft inside . 
i have a thick mattress , a 4 '' foam topper , and then this topper - all fit in a 12 '' deep pocket sheet . this topper adds about 2 '' ; add that your mattress 's thickness and compare with your sheet 's pocket depth . 
i sleep on my side most of the time . my mattress was new , but too firm and a bit warm . this makes it very nice . 
the elastic material that goes around the mattress is generous so it will fit literally any mattress depth . 
hello , i have to be honest and say i am not sure the mattress topper will cool down a memory foam mattress but i can tell you that the mattress topper is very thick and perhaps in conjunction with a mattress pad , it may be suitable for your needs . a bamboo mattress pad or the bamboo version of the mattress topper may work for you as i understand them to be cooler than other fabrics . i have three layers over mine - an thick egyptian cotton mattress pad , a bamboo mattress pad , and then the mattress topper . i hope this was helpful and i hope you find the right solution for your situation . : ) 
according to the manufacturer it is 850 watts 
850 watts very good power+it has a glass jar everything else out there on the market is plastic . 
it can crush olaf from frozen . 
looks like the same machine to me . 
i am not sure about that . i did make 'cashew ricotta cheese ' on it once , and it came out so creamy and smooth so i tend to think maybe you can . it seems to be ok with soaked nuts anyay . 
they did not make mine different , but i have not had any of those problems , maybe because of how we put the ingredients in or process them or because god loves us : ) i am sure we have avoided those problems because of how we do things , i.e. , how we put stuff in or how we process them . 
pretty much , yeah , it did for me . i do n't remember trying to put anything together except for the general assembly of it because they package everything in the safest way . 
i am sorry , we do not stock 230volt machines . jerry 
broke after a short time sent back without problem 
without tearing a box apart , i 'm realatively certain it is imported from korea 
eh it kind of works but it does not work nearly as well as regular potatoes . i tried a snickers bar once too when i was drunk baked . i wouldnt reccomend it . 
just cut them in 4ths if you have to man 
i just measured the blades ; blade one has 1 2 '' squares , and blade two has 3 8 '' squares . my husband just made oven baked fries with the 3 8 '' and they were great , but he did cut the potato in half length wise to fit in the cutter , as the entire opening is 2 7 16 '' square . 
the pusher does push ther potato all the way through . its a really impressive cutter . 
no . it has two size blades but not one skinny enough for me to call shoestring 
no 
about 3 8 '' 
yes 
yes 
none , it broke cutting the first potato . 
yes , it fits over the mattress , it has a generous size stretchy banding 
r. brown , thanks for the interest in our products . the fitted skirt on this mattress pad is made to fit to any bed up to 18 inches thick . let us know if you have any other questions at all . thank you ! -brett els customer service 
hello , this is going to fit like a fitted sheet , to help keep it held into place . thank you for inquiring . 
2.5 inches according to the exceptionalsheets website . some reviewers here on amazon are confusing this one with the extra plush only version . this one is the thicker one . 
the difference between the two is the double thick topper is twice the thickness of the bamboo topper . the bamboo topper also has a top that is 70 % polyester 30 % rayon from bamboo and is perfect for anyone who has trouble sleeping due to night sweats or getting overly warm when in bed because of the excellent breathability of the material . 
all i can say is that it feels like a pillow top bed . i feel like i 'm sleeping on a cloud . 
hi i purchased this pillow top for my king bed and it worked perfectly . also , i purchased the king size sheets on amazon , `` southshore fine linens aspen lace-king again it worked perfectly . like the sheets more than i purchased at macy 's came out too wrinkled . p.fox 
too soft for babies and toddlers 
the size of the shipping box is 30l x 21w x 18t and the pad comes in its own heavy plastic zip bag like comforters are in in the stores ! hope this was helpful ! ! 
i have not experienced the topper being any hotter than the regular mattress , and i live in southern california where it 's hot anyway . 
yes 
yes its 72 , , pretty big ... i love it 
yes . it does an excellent job . the ultima has the vortex blade similar to the vitamix blender . 
i make peanut butter often n love it , and flour do n't know have not try but preaty sure u can , this machine is really good.. 
my ninja is 120 volts only . 
yes the blade detaches completely , super easy to clean .. 
3 
yes it does n't come with an adapter though but it will work 
yes 
yes you can

it does have slide out sides to fit the window . they also accordion from the unit in case you have a smaller window . 
i 've only had this unit for 2 months but it performs reasonable well for such a small unit . 
generous . about 5-6 feet . 
yes . it comes with the usual accordion type sides and screws and such . 
yes , a pleated quick mount window mounting kit included . 
yes , the tracks and all related hardware are included , along with nice door knobs . i installed 2 side-by-side for a closet and did n't need to purchase any additional hardware for the installation . 
no : the length could be cut but not the width by that much . 
we do not , all of our doors are clear pine . thank you ! 
good afternoon , we have had some people in the past do this , and had great succses , however , if you were to do this , we would not be able to take any return . they are solid core , so if you chose to cut them , it should work . thanks , aaron 
yes our doors are solid core . thanks aaron 
about 35lbs at most . 
these are one inch thick . thank you . 
it 's one bifold so you 'll need to order two for a full opening . 
yes , ours did too , and i could feel a spring on my hip . do n't get me wrong , this is not the perfect solution , only a seriously expensive mattress will do that ! lol we have had our topper now for about 2 months or so and it is so much better ! no more pain in my hip , very comfortable . but be sure to get the quality topper . do not go for the cheaper eggshell version . believe me it is worth it ! 
no ... .super comfortable and has reduced my morning aches . 
yes it does . but , i have hard time getting bottom sheet to fit . 
no , i 'm pretty sure the cover is not waterproof but it immediately made a difference sleeping and waking up ache and pain free . 
it has been a while , but the king was pretty large and heavy . i would guess 18x18x22inches and 20 pounds . 
15 '' high x 15 '' wide x 18.5 '' 
i have n't had tearing issues . i have had mine about 9 months and i still love it : ) going to bed is a comfy experience ! 
yes , you can use an electric blanket . make sure you purchase with the waterproof cover which has deep pockets and will cover your entire mattress and topper . 
mine has no tag on it or brand . also my topper is about 2 inches to short on each side of the bed . i ordered a queen and have a queen size bed . the topper makes my cheap mattress feel so much better though ! ! the only problem is mine was n't the full length of my bed and i sleep on the edge of the bed . other than that it 's comfortable . also , mine did n't come with a mattress pad cover that it states 
it sits on top of the mattress 
yes 
i am not sure what you mean by `` canning '' . foodsaver makes a jar attachment for regular and wide-mouth canning jars , but you can not replace the canning process with this machine . it is only safe to vacuum-seal dry items in jars if you are n't going to process the jars in a water bath . rice , whole grains such as wheat berries , beans , legumes , pasta , nuts , chocolate , freeze-dried foods , herbs , whole spices and many other dry food types will last much longer when vacuum-sealed in glass instead of plastic . some whole grains will last years . edit - i have been using the jar attachment for several years to take advantage of bulk items at costco and to store my emergency food supply . do a google search wendy dewitt . she does a food storage seminar for the lds community that is terrific . 
i 'm pretty sure you can . i have done this a few times myself without any adverse effects . i do know for certain , that they make a freeze 'n steam bag ( fsfsbc0316 ) which allows you to freeze and then steam in the microwave . 
i tried it on a bag of m & ms and it sealed it but did n't vacuum seal it . it made the noise like it was trying to suck the air out but did n't . 
you can order the jar attachments separately . there is one for the wide-mouth and one for the regular-mouth jar . one other buyer figured out how to adapt the accessory attachment to operate the jar attachments . call customer service for help . 
i have used the generic supplies quite successfully . you have to pay attention to what side is up , usually the smooth side 
the v4880 is a specific model number from within the v4800 series . there are multiple v4800 series models such as the v4825 , v4865 , and v4880 . all of these foodsaver operate in the same manner and the only difference is that the v4880 and v4865 each have a pulse vac feature that other v4800 series do not have . the pulse vac feature allows you to manually pulse vacuum the air out of the bags . this feature is great when vacuum packaging soft or delicate items that may crush or damage through a continuous vacuum cycle . 
i have had my v448 for quite some time . after cutting bag to desired length , notice a natural curve to bag . place bag into slot with natural curve down . ensure after placing item to be vacuum sealed , you have approximate 4 '' of head space . again , place into vacuum sealer with natural curve down . you say that the largest bag width is 10 '' . it sounds as if you are using off brand bags . foodsaver bags have one side `` quilted '' . this quilted side allows grooves for air to be vacuumed out before sealing . hope this helps . 
yes , just use the moist cycle , and watch that it does n't get into the heat part . 
i use mine all the time , i just finished baking christmas cookies for all my friend and family and used my food saver with no issues . if you look where you slide your bags , there are two prongs , you have to hit those at the same time . and make sure the edge is flat . 
i used these for all my newborn infants sizes , my baby is now in 9 months sizes and these still work great . also am using them for my 2 year old who wears anywhere from 2t - 5t and my oldest wears up to a size 8 in girls and these still work pretty well for that size . anything after that and we use regular sized hangers 
i bought hanger clips to hang my daughter 's skirts and slacks . they are sold online or you can purchase them at most kid 's clothing stores . 
yes ! these are great hangers and very pretty , clothes do n't slip off at all 
i bought the pink ones and the had no odor . 
they can , but wo n't with out you wanting them to do so . 
i think they are more for kids sizes . the smallest size i 've used with them is 3t . 
the hangers are the same thickness out to the ends . they wo n't bulge unless your garment does . probably not ideal for something with padded shoulders or needing support as these are thin . jackets : only very light ones like a nylon windbreaker . the hangers flex and are not going to be happy with anything heavier than a standard shirt or blouse or light sweater . see my review for details . 
yes , you can rotate the tops of the hangers . 
i love these hangers . they are super sturdy . i use h in all of my coats 
yes . and a much better price 
i have gotten a lot of these hangers . but they are all the same and the amazon basics are a great deal . i bought them recently and will get these again when i need more . 
oh my gosh , are they space saving ! love these so much i got rid of all my other hangers . 
about 16 1 2 inches from end to end . 
yes 
no

hello stan , the dimensions of the products are : depth ( in . ) : 14.75 height ( in . ) : 11.5 interior capacity : 0.9 cu . ft. interior dimensions ( hxwxd ) : 8.31 '' h x 12.36 '' w x 12.66 '' d weight ( lbs . ) : 33.52 width ( in . ) : 19.1 you can buy the product from here : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00crme898 i hope this help you : ) 
19w ( add 0.5 '' for door swing ) 11.5h 14d ( add 1 '' for power cord and exhaust ) 
outside dimensions : 19 '' w 11.5 '' h 14.5 '' d inside dimensions : 12 '' h 8 '' h 12 '' d 
yes . they 're great hangers , and i use them for jeans as well as tons of other clothes . 
yes very much , so far all fabrics even slippery silky fabrics and wide shouldered shirts stay on without problem . 
a big yes to ur question i hate that as much as i hate ironing . they hang my garment surprisingly well , especially satin tops the velvet material on the hangers creates a buffer . 
yes , but if you rotate it too much , it will come loose . 
i have not had a single hanger break and i have been using them for months . i have not used them , however , to hang winter coats or the like . i use heavy duty wooden hangers for that . 
a little short of a quarter inch , a little more than 1 8 '' 
it swivels 
yes they will . they are very nice hangers , built well and take up minimal amount of space in the closet . and garments do not slip off from the velvet coating . 
i find that pants do not crease on the felt hangers like others ... .i also hang long maxi dresses over them in half so the dress length does not stretch out as they are heavier on the hanger than most dresses . i have had great results . another great bonus i have found is the greater amount of space i have in my closet , the hangers are slim and sturdy ! 
product dimensions : 17.5 x 0.2 x 9.5 inches ; 2.4 ounces 
is made out of acrylic 
sorry to say but this cake stand is made of low grade plastic , and although the idea of the thing is great , actually using it is risky as it breaks very easily . a friend had the same one and she put a warm cake in and the dome cracked right away . it is about 15 '' diameter and about 8 '' high with lid on . 
just under 11 '' 
it 's the size of a regular cake plate doom 
almost instantly although i usually leave in for about 10 seconds 
yes , it does . readable at day and night . 
to turn it on press the meat on off till the fork comes on . keep pressing the meat on off switch until the kind of meat you want it lit up . then you press the taste until it is the doneness you desire . stick the fork in the meat and the temp will show up and the fork will beep when you reach your desired doneness . hope this helps . 
yes , it is a long rectangular box about the size of the fork . should be easy to wrap . 
mine split in two after a few used so i 'm not sure it matters 
this can easily be used on hamburgers.i 've even used it on chicken wings , and it worked just great 
no 
yes , definitely remove the plastic . 
compartment on the back , lid will slid off , to acess the battery . 
yes it will display the range of doneness , once you set meat selection before inserting ... good device ! 
the trim is gray and the lettering `` kitchenaid '' is white . hope this helps . 
no it does not fit the larger professional style one . i had to return it because it did n't fit . 
yes , it works very well . got it for my daughter and me . 
good evening is compatible with the model : 5ksm7591 
it did mine 
yes . my sister is thrilled with her cover . 
yes . my mixer is an artisan and it fits well 
no 
i know it does n't fit the 5 qt , so maybe it would fit the 4.5 . 
i had purchased it as a gift . it did not fit the recipients mixer which is the big one . 
sweat shop in china ! 
yes , fits fine and having the kcups right there is very convenient . make sure that there is plenty of space under your cabinets with both the k75 and pod drawer stacked . ours fits nicely , but our daughter has to slide the unit forward out from under the cabinet to get the kcup inserted in the machine . 
it is bamboo 
yes you can . 
yes it will and that is what we did with ours 
width is 12.75 '' 
yes it will . the keurig sits on top of it . 
it is 3 3 16 inches . 
it measures 12 3 4 '' x 15 1 2 '' . 
there are brand new , but due to indian company they do not have good finish and it look like used , or some searches , factory in india do not work in dust free environment . 
if you get from indian mixer grinder store they you do not need to buy square trade warranty , it comes with 3 year warranty . but if you like to buy from square trade warranty , it is your all . 
it will do but not that good . 
yes working nice in us 
yes 
i got this mixer recently and it is really good . i use it twice a week to grind rice and dhal , it runs smooth with no issues . 
it 's a wicked , cool mist diffuser 
yes you can ! it works ! i love mine . 
yes . mine is connected to my computer all day

good morning anthony - yes may go on either side . the instructions to do so are included with the bed : ) thank you - scott 
good morning - i am not able to give you the weight capacity but can tell you the bed has met all the astm safety requirements for weight capacity . my understanding is the bed is tested with 400 pounds for a short period of time . this does not mean you should put 400 pounds on the bed . in general , beds that meet the astm safety guidelines have a recommendation of about 200 pounds of distributed weight per sleeping service . of course this will depend on many factors such as kids being kids and jumping up and down in one concentrated area or the thickness and quality of the mattress . i hope this helps . scott 
yes all that is included in total price . 
good day - the dimensions of the bed in twin size are 41 '' deep x 98 '' widex 64 '' high . in full size it becomes 57 '' deep . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
technically no , but you could use them separately . you would have to do your own modifications .

i ordered 8 inch mattresses and they worked perfectly . 
measuring from where 
i 'm 5'5 '' and the top bed rail comes right to my eyes . i believe it 's about 98 inches long . 
yes very easily . you can choose to screw it to the bed or not but it does have hooks that keep it from falling off . we got this bed and our aon loves it . 
the rail is fixed and the child does crawl over it . 
jus a bit over 4 ft . 
yes , the ladder is included in the suggested price . 
yes ! my kids love to build a fort below . we roll the bottom bed out ( it 's on wheels ) . very happy with this purchase . 
yes the full is not connected to rest of bed . but there is no headboard 
the opening space is more than enough for a full sized bed , even with the frame that comes with this bed , which is pretty wide . since a queen size bed is not much lager than the full , i think you 'll be ok. but it will also depend on the frame of the queen size bed 
the hight is 64 '' the width from the storage area to the right of the lower mattress is 80 '' the lenght over all of the lower section is 80 '' 
we put the bottom part in storage , it just needs the mattress . 
the trundle fits a conventional twin mattress but must be 6-7 '' thick max . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
mostly by yourself but will need someone to hold up or balance a couple of parts . my 10 year old was able to assist . 
it is pretty tight . my wife is 5'3 '' '' and hits her head . 
good morning sergio - yes there is a white twin over twin listed by dreamscape as well . the listing is http : www.amazon.com gp product b00fyvgkou . this one is for the drawer option and there is another one for the trundle option . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott

it comes with slats for secure mattress support , no box springs needed . just add mattresses and you 're ready to go ! 
dimensions : 98.5 '' w x 57 '' d x 63 '' h 
the staircase bunk beds are not designed to be used separately . 
this bed is finished on all sides . 
yes , the staircase can be placed on either side at the time of assembly . 
good morning julie - it would depend on what part of the country you live in . the further away from florida- the longer it will take . in general it takes 2-7 working days . if you are in a remote area of the country it may take longer . i hope this helps . 
first of all , i love this bed i purchased for my granddaughter . i felt comfortable being on top as i made the bed several times and i am 150 + . i think my granddaughter is around 80 # . it 's a nice piece of furniture and i think you can purchase as just a loft . there should be options to choose from . i hope this helps . 
hello roy - the dimensions of the bed are 67 '' high x 57 '' deep x 78 '' long . please keep in mind you will also need room to open the drawers under the staircase . hope this helps . scott from dreamscape furniture - feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you have more questions . 
hello - the bed does not come fully assembled . the bottom half of the staircase is fully assembled as is the drawer pedestal under the bed . the bed goes together very well and has fully diagrammed directions . i would say 2 hour assembly for someone who never did it before . scott - dreamscape furniture - 8007719330 if you have any further questions . 
hello angela - if you are buying it from dreamscape furniture , it is included along with free shipping : ) thank you - scott 
yes 
yes 
hello steven - that is a tough one since wood does not like extreme temperature changes that may occur from the vent being right on it . i would think if you did your idea of the deflector it would work but do not know for sure . sorry i could not be of more definitive help to you . thank you - scott 
no . xl stands for `` extra long '' . twin xl is 5 inches longer than a regular twin . this bed fits a regular twin mattress pretty snugly . 
hello haon - this model bed is basically as advertised except for some minor exceptions - the slats are metal and the back of the chest unit is a hardboard covered in wood grain ( basically the same thing you would find in the back of any chest you would buy at the store ) . all else is made from furniture grade pine . there is no mdf or particle board in this model . the white version of this bed does have mdf components but that is actually a good thing . mdf is fine - particle board in not fine . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott

we purchased 8 inch . fits perfectly 
the drawers are 16 '' deep , so they pull out about 14 '' . 
we received metal slats ( like metal tubes ) for the upper and lower bunks . they are screwed into the framing . it seems quite sturdy for our boys . 
yes ! 
never happens . must be instant coffee . 
yes 
yes it does . 
i have the keurig 2.0 k500 , but they should work with any 2.0 machine . they include orange stickers you need to apply to the top , then they work . 
this cup has a slight outside rim , and because the screen mesh is around lower edge and the bottom , i have never had the issue of coffee flowing over the top . i suppose if your coffee was ground extremely fine , this could be an issue . 
as long as it says all 2.0 brewers it should work fine . mine came with orange stickers to put on the top and only worked once i put them on . good luck 
no . you do n't need to remove . but these are a waste of money . coffee quality terrible compared to k-cup . wish i had n't bought . 
yes 
bob , sounds like you got a brewer that has a defect in the manufacturing by keurig . as we have tested this unit in every brewer and it works and closes every time . reach out to us by clicking on the contact seller button for ekobrands llc and we will get you taken care of . 
cr2032 
have you asked thermoworks . my experience is that they make quality products and stand behind them . 
this is a single timer , but at this price you could afford to have more than one . i have two now . 
the timer will chime for 60 seconds at a rate of about once every second . after that , the timer will begin to track how long it has been since the initial timer expired . during this time , it reminds you every 30 seconds ( roughly ) . i did n't count how many times it will remind as i got annoyed and turned it off . suffice to say , 4 minute after the timer initially expired , i was getting a reminder . 
it does very well . mine has been dropped from 6 feet up a bunch of times . 
we have yet to travel with it , but i feel it is on the heavy side for such . the wireless feature is nice , and the light is a bright white , not yellow like others . it 's not cheap , but it is well-made . if you want the best , buy it . if you are on a budget , there are other products available for a fraction of the cost . 
you can pick hop usb wall chargers in most stores that sell cell phone accessories . i just use my ipad charger currently ( no pun intended ) . 
this mirror folds , and it comes with a semi-hard black case that feels pretty sturdy to me . the case zips . 
the magnification on this mini mirror is 10x ; it 's 5x on the larger mirror . i actually use both mirrors . i guess i 'm blind as a bat ! 
dear regina , the dimensions for the mini sensor mirror are 5.7 '' width x 4.5 '' depth x 11.7 '' height . best , simplehuman 
yes and no , it has 2 height settings . mirror is attached at about 2 '' from the top . if you rotate the mirror it is now attached 2 '' from the bottom making the mirror about 3 '' taller . 
i use it for full face makeup and think it is wonderful . magnification is very strong but still allows you to apply makeup . 
no , it does not . that is the only downside of this mirror . i take a small compact with a mirror to use with it when i travel . 
not sure . i am taking mine to greece and croatia . i will be taking a converter as well . once the mirror is charged up , it will run for several hours on its own power , cordlessly . make sure to leave for your trip with it fully charged and you may make it the whole trip without needling to recharge ! 
i had the same problem . simplehuman did n't tell me why it stopped working but they replaced it immediately . i had my invoice number , receipts , etc ... i also previously registered the product on their website . i chose to exchange the product through simplehuman which meant i purchased a second mirror on their website . i used the packaging from the new mirror and shipped out the broken mirror with all of my receipts . this exchange took all of 3 days -- my credit card was credited the following week . 
no it is not ... it has a steel cap and that holds all the fruits ... 
almost exactly 1ft . tall . 
always contact the seller for questions like that . you can email them at sales @ grosche.ca , they are really nice and appreciate that you bought their product . i 'm certain that they can help you , and get you a new ring for the pitcher . 
i have dish washed mine but usually wash it by hand as i wish to use it immediately again . the glass is very thick but could get broke in dishwasher if it is knocked against something harder . very quality looking and feeling . 
mine does not 
no , you can not . this particular pitcher is made of soda glass . it 's suitable for cold and room temperature water or juice . it does not accomodate boiling water . refer to grosche website for other pitchers that are made of borosilicate glass that you can pour boiling water into . 
based on the info on their website : http : www.grosche.ca product accessories rio-water-pitcher grosche international is a canadian , family run business . we design and produce high-quality tea , coffee , and beverage related products that are not only functionally superior , but also unique in design . everything we make is bpa and phthalate free , as well as hand blown and assembled for a personal touch . our goal is to ensure that you enjoy your tea and coffee experience by bringing you great products that fit your world . 
no 
no , it is a decent weight ( not too heavy , not too light ) and the circumference of the pitcher is easy to handle 
using it for thick smoothies might create a problem because the lid is made to strain water of fruit solids . if you wanted to use it for most juices , i suspect it would work . i think , though , that you could find better juice pitchers . for fruit-infused water , these are lovely , but they would be better if they held twice as much . 
these are definitely more cream colored , mine do n't look gray or brown at all . 
im not sure possibly mdf but they are solid and god quality 
the seat is padded with high and medium density foam to insure a maximum comfort . the measurements are overall : 24 '' d x 17.75 '' w x 39.5 '' h seat:19 '' h x 17.70 '' w x 17 '' d 
the dimensions are chair : 24 '' d x 17.75 '' w x 39.5 '' h seat:19 inches high x 17.70 inches wide x 17 inches deep 
these chairs would be just perfect for 30 1 4 '' high table 
these chairs can support up to 250 pounds 
the color in the picture is pretty representative to how it looks in real life . the color is off-white . 
they are not but the fabric is very durable . easily gaurded . 
this chair is 18 '' wide . 
hello , the frame is made of steel tubes with durable wipe clean polyester fabric . hope this can help you . 
hello , thank you for your question . the dimension of this product is 32.25 l x 13.50 w x 25.00 h inches . hope this information can help you . 
hello , thank you for your question . our product is made in china and we have a very good quality . hope to serve you better . 
these are `` about '' measurements , since the bag expands wider when you put clothes in . 10 '' wide , 14 '' deep , 20 '' tall in front and 24 '' in back . hope this helps 
i would n't launder them , i would spot clean them by hand . i would n't think they would get very dirty . i 've used them now for 2 months and the bags are not dirty . 
yes , the wires just loop through the top of the bag for easy removal . 
mine is 35 inches wide . 16 inches deep and 35 1 2 inches high . it is totally awesome , but too big for a 28 inch space . 
canvas like material 
i had no weird smell at all with mine . it has been a great purchase 
mine are plastic , but i have not had any problems 
not quite sure what a caster is . but if you 're talking about the piece that connects the bars together it 's plastic . nothing is rubber except the coating on the hooks that are attached to the bags 
35.5 '' w , 35.5 '' h , 15.5 '' d 
i have n't had any problems to far . 
31 '' wide exactly : ) 15 1 2 '' deep ( front to back ) 
this ca n't be folded for storage once it 's built . 
hello , thank you for your question . we only have 3-bag laundry sorter now . it will have bigger room than sorter with 4 bags . and if we have 4-bag laundry sorter later , we will tell you about that . have a nice day . 
i have it next to my wall . it is great for what i need it . i do n't iron so much but its sturdy . 
mine are more of a tan color . 
yes 
20.5 '' back height 17 '' front height 13 '' front to back 8 '' wide left to right 
no they can not be locked 
i checked - the label said `` do not wash. wipe with damp cloth . '' 
33 1 4 '' to the top of the metal pole . 
i have a pretty modern sofa sleeper , and had experience with standard or factory provided foam mattresses . we installed this one , and had no problems so far . it is big enough to cover the whole frame . honestly , if an adult has to sleep on it is ok for cushioning , but keep in mind it is a little on the hard side . children are ok. we only use it for emergency situations , or short sleep overs . the thicker , the better . the extra width allows you to not feel the metal parts from the frame . 
yes its a cover with a zipper which you can wash . 
it 's a queen sized mattress . you 'd have to measure your sofa . 
no 
very good product . 
no , it 's only the mattress . it 's wrapped in plastic and will need an hour or so to reshape . 
no 
made in america ! 
this does n't add much bulk and was thinner then the original mattress 
mine was a queen size and came in one box . it turned my useless sleeper sofa into a comfortable bed 
hmmmm ... .let me measure . i have them on a hospital bed with a gel mattress , . i think they would comfortably fit a 12 '' mattress . hope that helps . 
60 % cotton 40 % polyester 
these sheets are 200 thread count . 
it is 62 inches by 96 inches . 
over prices very cheaply made sent mine back . not worth $ 27 do n't do it . 
the fitted sheet is designed to fit a twin xl mattress of size 39 x 80 inches ( 99 x 203 cm ) . 
the fitted sheet is designed to fit a twin xl mattress of size 39 x 80 inches ( 99 x 203 cm ) . 
this sheet set is a blend of cotton and polyester . cotton 60 % and polyester 40 % . 
cotton rich generally means that cotton is the largest component of the blend . this sheet set is 60 % cotton . 
the primary difference ( and advantage ) is the 1385 's larger boiler , 64oz verses the 48oz of the 1375. the amount of water boiling determines the steady flow of steam you get . so while either model will operate at 4 bar 58psi , you can run steadily at a higher pressure with the boiler of larger capacity . in addition , the 1385 has 23 vs 20 accessories , for what that 's worth . be sure to visit mcculloch 's website , it 's easy to compare specs of all their models . 
the handle does contain a a + and - valve like wheel , you can adjust the volume of steam coming from the nozzle and it seems to add a slight pressure when turned up . it does not however apply pure pressure . its a great steamer however does not work well at all on heavy greased areas such as on or around vehicles . 
yes it comes with a straight nozzle with a brass tip you can add to the nozzle which cleans grout amazingly ! 
i use it for auto detailing and i use the triangle attachment . if you plan to do your house floor you may need to buy an ectractor instead . 
try ebay 
yeah , i noticed they have a backpack unit too which may be more convienent but we love this thing . the squeegee attachment works very good . 
heat and alcohol kill bed bugs , so this should work . good quality mattress encasements are essential and then a product called sterifab http : www.sterifab.com q % 26a.html sprayed on all cracks and crevices . the heat in this device should work as well . 
yes , each attachment will utilize the wand . using the mop pad is just part of another attachment . 
greater then 212 degrees fahrenheit . the unit essentially boils water under pressure . 
no . it does n't works on carpets . 
when the water gets too low , it ceases to hold pressure high enough to create steam . the indication on the pressure light gets lower ( below 2 ) , but you will also notice that the sound has changed . it is obvious when more water is needed . 
i have , i used the mop brush attachment without the fiber pad . used it to steam sanitize the carpets from fleas . just be sure to vacuum beforehand . 
1375 - 90 mins of steam and 20 accessories , 1275 - 45mins of steam and 18 accessories . biggest difference is the 1275 has no variable control on the steam pressure output to the hand nozzle , where the 1375 has a variable control to adjust the steam pressure depending on cleaning job you are tackling . 
it works great for that ! 
no but it recommends distilled to reduce mineral build up . if you do n't use distilled water it recommends to rinse out with vinegar on a monthly basis . when i first got the cleaner i used tap water and it still worked great . i recently been using distilled so i do n't have to worry about soaking the tank in vinegar . 
about `` exhaust fan area '' , i do n't know , it would depend on the area configuration . keep in mind the steam is very hot ; be careful on what you apply it , and whith which temperature grade ! make a try , and step by step from low to higher , see what it does . as to the grease in the stove , yes yes ! ! ! for a better result , i spray some cleaner first , and then , ahead it goes . it 's great ! ! ! 
there is a trigger lock button so you do n't have to hold the trigger . 
honestly , based upon the reviews and my previous experience with this product and brand , i would tend to see it as replaceable more than repairable . with careful maintenance ... ... .especially regarding water quality , my last one stayed in good service for 7 years odd regular use . i like the brand because it puts out good volume and is sturdy . repairs would not be easy to find and would likely be more costly than a replacement . i think 7 years of weekly use is a good value ... ... hope that helps . 
i think the blinds would come clean , i used mine on a metal exterior door with 9 panes of glass . it cleaned up wonderfully , even around each pane . i cleaned my stove exhaust also and was quite pleased . as far as the dog bed , it will feel nice . i have cleaned my recliners and couch and they feel clean , but not sure that it is the best way to clean fabric yet . still i love this machine . 
the answer is `` it depends '' . it depends how dirty the grout is . i use it all the time but i still need to scrub to get cleaning done . this is hot steam not a power washer . 
no 
yes 
it does not need to be refrigerated . it comes in a plastic sleeve . it sat on my counter for a month . 
i do n't know the exact dimensions , but yes , it will fit on a 9x13 inch cake . the decal is actually rectangular and covers the majority of a 9x13 inch cake . the decal is mostly white with the round image in the center . if you do n't want the decal ( which is mostly white background ) to cover the majority of the cake , you could probably cut the elsa and anna image out . the smaller image ( i think it was 2x3 inches ) was round and was just the girls , but again , the larger image is rectangular . 
i froze mine for a month before i used it and it was fine . 
i used it on a regular frosted cake . 
i left my edible image in a cool , dry place away from sunlight & heat for a couple of weeks and it was totally fine . if you ordered now , it will probably be 8-9 days before delivery ( esp w christmas later this week ) , so it would only be a couple of weeks until your daughter 's bday . 
id put it in a zip lock bag . should work fine . keep it in the a cool area . do not place in the fridge . 
im not sure i used mine on royal icing but they are pretty stiff when they are peeled of the paper and they soften up when placed on cookies or cakes . 
we saved our leftover cake overnight the next day the picture was tad bit blurry . so i would n't recommend applying it until the day of serving the cake . it applies easily yhough , perhaps decorate everything leaving a blank space for it ? 
yes i can print your photo on any of our sizes . here is a link to my storefront . http : www.amazon.com create-custom-edible-cupcake-topper dp b00bqrwm34 ref=sr_1_1 ? m=a128hnjp60vh8a & s=merchant-items & ie=utf8 & qid=1424393344 & sr=1-1 & keywords=create+your+own thanks , eric 
yes our images are kosher and i can add any text you 'd like to the image . thanks , eric edible art 
if you put it in the freezer for 1 minute it 's easier to remove it and place it over cake . 
you should be able to message the seller with the invoice number right through your purchase using your order information . 
yes , it 's in its own separate sealed package outside of the shipping package . 
yes 
yes it can ! i removed it to make a broach bouquet ! 
soak it in water and it will absorb and keep water in . 
no it does n't screw off . however , the green sponge on the inside can be wet or dampen to provide moisture to fresh flowers . beware this item is small in case you were looking for a more fuller looking bouquet 
i believe it 's more metal all throughout the handle , it makes a metallic `` clink '' when you tap it with a fingernail or something that is plastic . it 's probably only silver plated though , so take care not to scratch it . the crystal and pearl inlays are most definitely plastic however . i hope i answered your question to your satisfaction , do n't hesitate to ask any more : ) 
if you look there are small tabs just above the silver portion of the piece you push them in and pull up on the white grid . 
yes i use fake flowers but still beautiful 
the foam ball is what holds the flowers in . since i was using this for brooch bouquet i replaced the floral foam ball that is designed to hold water with a regular styrofoam ball so i could glue in my flowers and brooches . 
hi , it is resin 
small should be a little bigger for a brides bouquet 
product size : width : 10.63 '' approx length : 6.29 '' approx height : 3.94 approx thank you 
no it is about 1 inch off of what it says 
24mm x 24mm , 40mm deep from the front of the slot ; 50mm from the back of the slot as the top is slanted 
lipstick holders size - 24mm x 24mm , 40mm deep from the front of the slot ; 50mm from the back of the slot as the top is slanted 
it is hard plastic . it 's like the cosmetic display stands at the local drug store . the draws does n't come out smoothly , but i do n't really use it much . it 's really convenient ! great way to keep the makeup organizes and visible . 
i will allow your order just in hours . as you verify this message , please place an order the item as soon as possible . 
norway ok ! shipping is available . 
canada , delivery is possible . thank you 
hi - you did not mention the height of each layer , but for an overall 3.5 '' - 4 '' cake height , you would need 2 sheets . the sheets we received were 8.5 '' x 11 '' , not as the stated quarter sheet size ( which would be 9 '' x 13 '' ) . i hope this helps . if you have any other questions , feel free to contact us ! ! 
the sheet was only about the size of an 8 by 10 sheet of paper . i had bought 2 because i was n't sure either . the cake i was doing was an 8 inch round and ended up just using one sheet cut in half using a box cutter . i butted the two strips to go around the cake sides . whimsical practicality or leanza 's bakery site where this sugar sheet came from has a sugar sheet chart giving approximately how many to use for different size cakes that might help you some . 
very thin . i 'd say less than 1 8 '' . but i 'm just guessing . another way to say is probably a bit thicker than paper . 
yes it will . i used this on an 8 inch round cake 
when you receive them there is instructions on storing . but i 'm sure it says in a cool dry place not necessarily in the refrigerator should keep for a few months . i ordered some months ago and did n't use them yet and they look fine . hope that helps . 
i bought 5 to be on the safe side , just in case i was to mess one up . these sheets you have to be very careful or they will rip very easy . 
when i ordered my sheets it was almost 3 weeks before time i needed them . i only ended up using only one sheet and still have the other sheet . it 's still good and that 's been a couple months . 
i purchased this and it shipped wonderfully . it was in a flat package between cardboard and was not bent or damaged in any way . 
4 st least 
it is exactly 9 1 4 '' wide and 7 3 4 '' long . 
yes it 's borderless . got it for my daughter , it 's perfect . 
no it is n't 
dear sachi , standard ( free ) shipping takes from 10 to 15 working days . however , you can also choose expedited shipping for $ 34.95. it takes from 2-3 business days . maybe , this is an option for you . kind regards , customer service team poster outlet 
hi the quality is very high resolution , you wo n't be disappointed : ) very happy with purchase ! 
dear alexis , at the moment , we do n't have this item on stock . we had to reorder it . that is why it takes so long to ship it . kind regards , customer service team poster outlet 
yes they are metal . that is exactly what i used these jars for , to mix essential oils ( young living ) they are absolutely perfect , make wonderful gifts . i need to order more . 
the lids are not magnetic . 
i do n't think they are lead . here is what nakpunar says about their jars ... the jars we sell have special bpa free lids and you can use them for foods . they can also be waterbath for the jams . apr 22 , 2014 by nakpunar 
they are 2 inches tall with the cover on . 
yes , you can store liquid in these . i do . the lid fits tight . 
i sort of doubt it . the seal is n't that tight . however , i have never tried to seal them in a water bath . i only use them to hold small amounts of different oils i mix with other oils . 
they are just 6 jars in a single order . 
i 'm not 100 % sure , but i can tell you that ours have gone in the dishwasher many times without a problem . 
we put honey in ours , which we do n't want to heat . that being said , if the lids are screwed on , i think these could easily break in the oven . you might try one without the lid and see what happens . glass is often used in ovenware , but not with a sealed lid . the contents could expand with heat . 
yes they 'll be great for the creams and balms . i use some of the jars for same purposes and never have a leakage etc . problem . the lid is wide so it 's easy to use too ! 
it 's like 24 x 63. really big . however it does have neat little borders if you want to cut each map out and frame it . 
it 's actually really easy to read . it being about six feet tall helps . lol 
pretty detailed . the center map has the general areas like the shire , and has details such as michel delving and hobbitton . 
i am 5'9 and not skinny and i find it quite comfortable 
the ad here for the red one has the photo showing it opened : http : smile.amazon.com sleeper-folding-foldable-density-pounds dp b00g2s9i0w ref=ph 
i opened it all the way and used my own pillow . that bak pillow is not a bed pillow . 
yes , the whole unit is . 
approx 36 `` x 36 '' by 8 '' to 10 '' thick it was vacuum packed ! it really expands when opened ! ! 
no , it does n't have to be against the wall ! i had the same concern , but my son and his friends can lean back on it no problem . the chair has very strong bands that attach to velcro at both sides . i ca n't speak to how long they will last -- we 've had it for about 6 months . 
no 
it smelled like rubber foam when i first opened it up . not noticeable now 
its almost sofa level . i have a sectional sofa and when this is sitting next to it , i can still put my arm on the sofa arm from the chair 
the cover is n't washable , it 's permanently attached as is . i 've been told that a regular fitted sheet will cover the bed ( i used it for a cross country trip so i did n't use a sheet ) . as far as different colors , the chair is available in other colors with different sellers . 
yes - it is very well made and the lid has nice finish and fits perfectly . we are very pleased overall with our purchase - although this was without a doubt the largest griddle we have ever owned . 
says made in china . 
in general , i believe that most zojirushi products are manufactured in the main factories in japan . however , they have a user-friendly website and i 'm sure they will tell you via e-mail regarding this particular unit . 
23.75 in x 14.5 in 
i do n't usually go that high on the grill as far as the temp . the 300 seems to work for what i am cooking like french toast and hash browns and sausages . maybe that is why i have n't raised the temp it may have gotten to hot . i did n't notice . its super easy to clean also . i love this . i would get a second if i had the space or money . the lid is great to keep the dust off it as i store mine on top of the fridge . its not very heavy either . 
hi larry , the zojirushi electric griddle dcc10 is 1350w as per the manufacture . 
you can cook all of those things , easily . 
none of the above , i 've looked everywhere on all parts 
there is a recessed area all around the surface to catch some drippings . it could get overfull but that is not too likely . 
did you figure anything out about this ? i am wondering the same thing . it says that it 's titanium coated ceramic over aluminum . titanium is supposed to be really good , even safer than stainless . i 'd love to hear your feedback if you purchased it or did any more research . 
it 's about 4 '' x 1,5 '' ( 10,5cm x 3,8cm ) , the same size of a twinkie . i think it 's too small even for mini hot dog . 
it 's a coated pan so unless you scratch it deeply and keep it wet i ca n't see how it will . it is a very sturdy and heavy pan . hope this helps . 
why not , they would be donut sticks . the pan is great just grease well for easy release of whatever your cooking 
no , the only recipe is ( delectovals mini cakes ) , if this is the same as ( twinkie ) i do n't know 
twinkling good vanilla snack cakes - it is on the king arthur flour web site . 
there are many different products you can buy to fill pastry , it depends on your comfort level and what you are filling . wilton and norpro have some good options that are kits with different tips . i have been decorating for many years now and i have a long stainless steel tip that i use with a pastry bag . you can purchase many of these items on amazon . if you choose the tip and pastry bag option , look for a 'bismarck ' tip . the length allows you to get the tip further inside the pastry lengthwise for filling . 
yes it can ship right away if ordered today 
no 
wilton lists the depth at 1 1 2 '' but in my opinion , it 's closer to 1 1 4 '' . 
if the oven is large enough for the pan to clear on all sides and close properly it should be fine . i am not familiar with that brand of oven so i do not have an idea of what the internal dimensions are . if a cookie sheet fits this should work . 
it is a platform bed 
3 '' 
anna , i ca n't answer because we bought this for our icomfort serta king size mattress and do n't know enough about the sleep number mattress . i can tell you that we used it briefly but recently removed it as the platform part is much wider than our mattress and took up too much room , plus it was a shin banger . it 's now boxed , covered and stored in the workshop . 
i do n't think so , we have a standard king which fits just perfect , i think a cali king would hang over 
yes , you do not need a box spring . 
i have a 14 '' memory foam mattress . i just measured and the mattress sits 2 '' below the top of the bed rail . a 10 '' mattress should work well in my opinion . 
5.5 '' 
10 inches 
no , it does not require a box spring . there really is no perfect mattress for a box spring , but the firmer the better in my opinion . depends on your level of comfort . 
yes it can carry the mattress 
the seller 's answer is inaccurate . there is less than two inches between the slats ( where the mattress rests on ) and the top of the sideboard . in other words , the frame conceals only 2 inches of the mattress . 
agreed . a bedskirt does `` poof '' . not recommended . 
no . this is basically a personal preference question . looks fine like any other bed . 
i do n't think it will . 
my mattress is 15 '' and i think it looks great . yours should be just fine . 
yes 
no 
no . there is no odor . 
you 'll jut sit lower then . i have beauty rest memory foam plus pillow top so part of my head board is covered . just keep in mind it 's a platform not a regular box spring . 
yes 
you have to remove the insert that is in there 
both are able to be used . i would n't buy it though . broke almost instantly and hamilton beach & amazon wouldnt refund it . 
you should always clean something new . , vinegar and water rinse a couple of times . 
yes you can 
yes , it does 
we have used our 2-way coffee brewer from hamilton beach for about a month now . you can not brew both sides at the same time since there is a control knob that you use to select either multi-serve or single serve and not both at the same time . we were a little surprised to learn after receiving our two-way that the upright pictured coffee mug was not included in the shipment . we complained about misleading packaging to amazon , the non-amazon supplier , and hamilton beach but no satisfaction about misleading packaging and received a comment `` not included '' to brush us off . unfortunately , hamilton beach is the only supplier of 2-way coffee brewers that we could find that also supported k-cups on the single serve side . be careful since this unit is sort of flimsy plastic and perhaps not very durable . 
height 13.5 inches by 9inches deep by 10inches wide . 
it holds from 1 cup to 2 cups depending on how big a cup you want . 
1 2 inch to 2 1 2 inches . 
yes 
actually this tray is not compatible with the ast420y stand . the base on the tripod of that stand is not wide enough and can cause a weight imbalance . however , it does fit ast422y and ast423y . both of these have a much sturdier and wider base . 
unfortunately this is not compatible with ast420y 
the poster is 24 inches x 36 inches . hope that helps . it really is a great looking poster !

the inside dimensions are 59 inches wide , by 46.25 inches heigh , by 41.5 inches deep . 
hello , thank you for your question . i can confirm that the total length of the bed is 96 inches . i hope this helps ! 
the drawers on the left side , which there are 5 of , are 13 '' deep x 4.5 '' high x 13.5 '' wide . i took those measurements from inside the drawers . 
the manual says 165lbs 
this is n't an official answer by any means , but i do n't think you can . the bed has a different method of attaching it on the stairs side than it does on the drawer side . 
have n't tried it ... but i can measure when i get home ... might be a little tight with a queen ... definitely would fit a full . 
i believe it is both , but i 've had one for almost a year , and my son , his friends , and our 60 pound dog have not been able to destroy it so far . assembly is a little time consuming , but it is very sturdy and looks great . 
59 inches in length , 42 inches in width and 46 inches in height 
no 
the chests can not be replaced by poles . the bed is very sturdy . i do n't think poles alone would be enough to support its weight . on the bright side , the drawers come pre-assembled so it is much easier to put together than i originally thought .

so far it is holding up well , but we only put it together 4-days ago . it took around 2-hours to build and the quality was better than i expected . not a bad deal for the money . 
it comes completely unassembled . 
my daughters ceiling is 8ft and i would think you would want to be at that height at the minimum . 
about 4 feet 
they are fixed . 
no 
from floor to top of rails is about 65 inches . im 5 foot ( dont have a measuring tape ) and the top rail is just a few inches higher than me . maybe the length is about 77 inches but not height . 
my husband says yes . i know you can turn the pullout keyboard part of the desk to pull towards the outside of the bed instead of towards the inside under the bed . 
yes 
a twin mattress should fit fine . nothing bigger than a twin would fit . 
the bag is made of food grade nylon ( nylon 6 or nylon 6,6 ) . nylon is used in many tea bags and the melting point of this type of nylon is between 428 f and 516f for nylon 6 and 6,6 respectively . https : en.wikipedia.org wiki nylon 
these bags are made of food grade nylon ( nylon 6 or nylon 6,6 ) . they are bpa free and bleach is not involved in the production process . food grade nylon is among the safer plastics one can use in terms of stability . any risk of leaching , and none has been demonstrated , would likely occur above the glass transition temperature ( 116.6 deg f for nylon 6 ) . the issue has not been extensively studied but it 's generally assumed to be safe , whatever thats worth . it 's not an answer but nylon is used in many tea bags and this is what any study would relate to since the tea market is still much larger than the nut milk bag market . if you are especialy concerned keep it under 116.6 deg f and it should be perfectly safe . 
good question , wondering myself . especially if you are putting acidic or hot foods in it . and for long periods of time like coffee . nylon is a kind of plastic after all . ? and no plastic is totally safe . but i can see using it for quick uses on nonacidic and cold foods ? 
yes , i believe so . i know it would be very full with that amount : ) 
i would like more information about the material it is made from also . people who use these bags and the producer are probably interested in health , so i 'm sure they 've researched what is a very safe material ? hopefully . it would be nice to share that information . 
it 's not a cheesemaker . 
the listing states 75. but , the listing also states that the 200 micron bags are tighter & strain out more than the 75 micron bags . no way . a 75 micron bag is a lot finer ( tighter ) than a 200 micron bag . the listing can not be trusted with the contradictory information . 
i turn it inside then just use warm soapy water . 
the product description says that it is 8 inches by 9.25 inches . a 1-gallon zip bag is 10 by 11 inches , so i expect this bag should hold almost 3 cups . 
it 's big enough for many nuts . we 're using it for almond milk , and can accommodate about 3 cups of almonds after hydration . that is - 3 cups of dry almonds , hydrated and ground fit just fine . 
the matching pillow cases you see in the photo are from a cotton sheet set , which is sold separately . 
i 'm not 100 % sure on how much smaller a full-size bed is from a queen ( that is what my girls share ) , but i can tell you that it covers the queen-size bed just perfectly with no extra hanging over . so for a full-size it would definitely hang over but i 'm not sure if you 'd be able to tuck it in . i hope this helps ! 
no . franco manufacturing co. , inc. , metuchen , nj 08840 made in china . that was on the tag on the blanket . 
if ordered through euphoric toys , item should arrive by saturday , because amazon offers free 2 day shipping . 
it 's a mix ... light purple to hot pink . hope that helps . 
summer weight - fleece 
yes , it will fit . its big 
there are three very small thin oval rubberized protectors around the rim of the underside of the holder . they lift the round bottom up a wee bit from the counter . i just totally rebuilt my kitchen , including new counter tops & there are no scratches from this product . 
13 '' from bottom of base to top . 
yes 
the order comes with 2 racks of 3 rows . each rack is 11 '' wide and 10 '' deep . so both side by side would be 32 '' wide or you can spread them out . hope this helps ! 
top opening is 3 1 8 '' . stem opening is 1 1 8 '' . i am happy with the sturdiness of the unit . make sure you have the correct orientation when you install so that you can slide the base of your stemware onto the racks . 
the rack itself is 10 '' . you might blow out the wood with the screws . you screw it in at the very front . 
i would guess a minimum 1 2 inch . 
i do n't have the answer because i had to return this product for that reason . i have a few different styles of riedel vinum stemware and some of them would not fit because the base was too large for this product . 
1 foot 
we are very happy with our malouf sheets . there was no discernable shrinkage after several washings . you should know a few things about our household and laundry demands in order to put our experiences compared to your particular demands . i assume that mattresss thickness is the root of your question about shrinkage . it 's not a big issue with us since we no longer purchase the very thick matresses which for us were not any better than those 7-9 incles thick . a good comfortable mattress is not determined by adding thickness in most cases . especially in these days of memory foam and the prevailent use of latex now , in our experience . we did not see unacceptable shrinkage in the pillow cases though . we washed the sheets before the first use . we use the new `` steam '' setting in our washer to get rid of most impurities when we wash the sheets . that gets pretty hot and we usually use that setting . our sheets are dried whenever weather permits on an outside clothesline to enjoy the fresh , cool finish on our sheets . there is no other way to achieve this effect , but the sheets have been machine-dried a lot this season because of frequent rain . one way or the other , our sheets are still like new . we buy only all cotton percale sheets so our efforts are justly rewarded . these sheets did live up to our expectations and we could not be happier with our choice . we hope this helps and good luck to you . 
it 's all cotton . 
yes . it will accommodate a mattress up to 18 '' deep . 
no ... .not listed on tag . 
hi it 's about 2.3ft or 68 cm .if you want give me an email where i can send you a pic with the mesure tape next to it 
i do not think there is a weight limit . these chairs are extremely sturdy and comfortable ! 
it 's more of a brownish bronze , which was darker than i expected . 
slide up to point in chair on arms to the point it sticks out . 
it has a comfort level of a park bench . it 's not a super comfortable chair but i can sit on it for a while without any issues . 
unfortunately this item is out of stock at the moment . i can let you know when it is back . let me know . thanks ! 
the seat height is 17 7 8 '' and the total height is 31 1 8 '' . they are great chairs . 
yes these chairs are normal size , and are surprisingly comfortable , i was going for an industrial rustic look in my dining room , and purchased the matching bar stools for our kitchen island- great find for the price ! 
just measured . 20 1 4 '' . and that 's from the widest point of th chair . 
i do n't know about the restaurant rating , but i do know that there is only eighteen inches across , so if you are over eighteen inches wide you will not fit . 
hi there . thank you for your inquiry . yes , we have them available with arms as well - http : www.amazon.com gp product b00fqruji0 . please be sure to select the ones sold by vertigo interiors usa , as these are guaranteed to match . 
hi kim . thank you for your inquiry . yes , the bases will have all black hardware , just as the picture shows . thank you ! jill 
thank you for your inquiry . the plastic on this chair is abs . 
hi sonia . thank you for your inquiry . we use the highest quality of materials on the market and our products are made specifically for us . we do not add flame retardants to the finish . 
plastic is approx . 100mm , thickness varies due to shape of the chair . 
they are a maple finish , i 'm afraid we do n't offer them in walnut . however you could varnish them for a 'darker ' look , but that would void and return warranty . 
yes , it is a set of 2 . 
overall height ( top of backrest ) : 32 '' seat : 17.5 '' 
thank you for your inquiry . the width of the seat is 18.5 inches . 
thank you for your inquiry . the finish on these chairs is right in between glossy and matte . 
it comes in a box that is as long as the bed is wide , and approximately 1 ft x 1 ft. inside the box the mattress is rolled and compacted and sealed in tough plastic that keeps it that way . after you carefully remove it from the box and remove the plastic , the mattress expands to it 's normal size . i would have it in place in the rv before taking off the plastic , because after it expands it would be tough move around through narrow doors etc . 
we bought one of these for our camper . we put a regular mattress pad and sheets on it . it is not hot . 
i would not buy this item ted . we had it less than a year and it already `` lost '' it 's memory . terrible . i contacted the mfg , supposedly it was is under warrantee ... .never heard back . do not recommend . 
i believe it will fit just fine . with only one inch extra on each side , the memory foam is flexible enough to fit inside of your end tables . mine is slightly long and when the slideout comes in , it pushes the mattress in a couple of inches , but when we open it back up the mattress returns to normal size . i just returned from a three week vacation and slept on this mattress the whole time . it is wonderful . my only regret is i did n't replace the cheap one forest river put in my georgetown sooner . you wo n't regret buying one . 
the top memory foam is 3 '' . do not know the density in pounds . if you read my review , i said this mattress is firmer than the one at home ( which is a difference mattress ) . i think it 's good for the price . time will tell how it holds up . i kept my shipping invoice , order from amazon and will definitely call the guarantee into play if it does n't meet expected performance . hope this helps some . 
it was a little firm so i added a 3 in topper from costco . i like a real soft mattress tho . 
what are the terms ? 
we feel the mattress is quite firm . recently a friend told me that it is suggested you break in this type of mattress by walking on it . this instruction did not come with our mattress but i think we may try it . 
sorry i could not locate the documents on the mattress . i can tell you it is very comfortable and there is no odor . 
this mattress is harder than spherical trigonometry , but you will get used to it . so hard a cat ca n't scratch it . harder than a wedding p*ck*r. ( buy a vowel ... ) harry 
yes , you have a manufacturers 5 year warrenty , but through chef 's you also have a lifetime warranty , so even when the manufacturer 's warrenty runs out , we will re-issue you a new waring pro if whatever reason , or if you choose to be refunded in full after let 's say 20 years of having the product , we would do so . 
it is removable for cleaning . and the entire cleaning process was quite easy . 
it is both a fryer and steamer . depending on what you are frying , ( chicken , turkey ) you can also use the rotisserie feature . 
yes , you should use the rotisserie every time . the turkey is not all the way submerged in oil and has to rotate to cook the turkey in the oil . 
yes ... just a bit . but try to keep the cover on . 
there is only the rotisserie rack and a basket for deep frying 
i have not used it yet . still sitting in a box . i bought the product because the propane fryers are too dangerous . 
110 v. no special outlet needed . 
i thought i read on the waring website the warrenty was 5 years . i checked numerous sites before buying the item . i would contact waring and ask them directly what they offer . 
yes 
no do not use this there . in the fine print , you see it is nsf 42 for water treatment standard . this is the minimum . filters for making truly potable bacteria-free water are nsf 53 ( 53 means they filter bacteria like naegleria , cryptosporidium , and giardia ) . for more info : http : www.nsf.org services by-industry water-wastewater residential-water-treatment residential-drinking-water-treatment-standards 
no it does not . in the fine print , you see it is nsf 42 for water treatment standard . filters for lead-free water are nsf 53. for more info : http : www.nsf.org services by-industry water-wastewater residential-water-treatment residential-drinking-water-treatment-standards 
no it does not . in the fine print , you see it is nsf 42 for water treatment standard . filters for making flouride-free water are nsf 53 for more info : http : www.nsf.org services by-industry water-wastewater residential-water-treatment residential-drinking-water-treatment-standards 
no , it is only for filtering for taste . does not get other contaminants like bacteria , lead , etc . in the fine print , you see it is nsf 42 for water treatment standard . this is the minimum . filters for making truly potable bacteria-free water are nsf 53 ( 53 means they filter bacteria like naegleria , cryptosporidium , and giardia ) . for more info : http : www.nsf.org services by-industry water-wastewater residential-water-treatment residential-drinking-water-treatment-standards 
no you do n't need to shake it every time you use it ! you only shook it the first time to activate the filter thing 
i think so . less waste , less expense . it 's always better to use a refillable water bottle than to buy water already bottled . it 's a huge waste . this filter gives you great.tasting water that 's always available . 
roughly the size of a softball . 5 '' tall x 4.5 '' wide or so . 
i was not thrilled with this . it 's about 1.5 inch opening ? i think my expectation was for a larger device . i was fooled by the gallon per minute rating ( plus i likely did n't look at the specs ... ) also , it was supposed to ship with an extra filter but did not . the device works well for a glass of water at a time but that 's about it . 
when the filter gets old it will slow down , using a new filter will fix the problem . 
you have to put this on top ( or hold it ) of your water container ( bottle , carafe , etc . ) and put it under the faucet . if you have shallow sink ( like i do , ) you will probably have to pour water into it instead of putting it under the faucet . 
the trundle can be placed on either side of the bed . 
wood plastic and leather 
yes , adults can sleep away on this bed . i weigh 236 and her mother weighs 147 and have been sleeping in this bed since we moved until our bedroom set arrives . 
it is lower . the trundle slides out from beneath the platform and remains on the floor . there is no ability to raise the trundle . 
it comes in a box about half the length of a mattress and same thickness 
you need a full size mattress for the top bed and a twin mattress for the bottom trundle bed . so one full mattress and one twin mattress . 
there is approximately 3 '' between each slat . 
you will not be able to use 10 '' mattress unless you take the wheels off the trundle bed . hope this helps . 
no the trundle is a full . 
we have had the bed for almost one year and have not had any problems with the casters or any problems at all 
yes , and it works very good two thumbs up 
do you mean the tray that sits on top ? yes - http : www.amazon.com ronco-compact-showtime-rotisserie-accessory dp b00006iuv0 ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1422468338 & sr=8-1 & keywords=ronco+accessories you can also get other accessories . in the the amazon search window just type in ronco accessories . 
you are ok with a ten pound roast . keep it at that . send samples . happy holidays . ( love my ronco ! ! ! ) 
hi c d ! yes , it comes with a dvd & recipe book ! 
yes it does ... it 's one of the best tools in my kitchen 
do n't have an answer for your question , but i 'd like to know the same thing . if i buy one i 'll come back and let you know . by the way , are you any relation to fred gross who used to live in towanda , pa ? if so , please say `` hi '' from me . tell him i 'm dave 's little sister , whom he service with in the navy way back in the 70 's . he 'll know . have a great day ! 
i 'm not sure . your best bet is to contact ronco . 
no the underside is fabric with a tag and the top is not flat . 
i have had grown adults & children sit on it often . i guess most weight would be about 180 lbs 
it is a flat surface , but it is a felt like material , i do n't think i would put any liquid on it . it also is not designed to be used as a tray , in my opinion it does not sit stable enough on top of the ottoman to use that way . 
my best guess is 3-5 pounds . the lid ( cushion part ) is actually the heavier portion . 
mine was shipped with other items so i ca n't be too specific , but it was flattened in the package and not much larger than say ... a frozen pizza . 
yes , it is . absolutely ; the old vinyl lp 's would not be a tight fit either . it 's really well made . i use it every day under my desk at work , putting my feet up . comfortable foot rest . 
i took the lid off and measured from the bottom to the top , and it is just over 13 inches deep . if whatever you planned to put in was taller that 13 inches , you would not be able to put the lid back on securely . 
no 
it is 14.5 inches high with the top on . it does have a bottom so it can be used for storage . 
it folds easily and is very sturdy . perfect for small spaces such as an rv , camper etc . 
no , the middle does n't do anything . the sides recline . if you want one with console and cupholders in middle , the matching recliner glider chair that goes with this has that . i have both in my house . 
yes . the middle section does not recline however . 
if you want to recline , you should be a couple few feet away from the wall . 
at absolute most i 'd say 35-40 degrees from being a completely flat 180 degrees . i hardly ever find myself actually leaning it that far though . 
no 
very hard if using foot . 
yes . 
nope , pretty short . i 'm 5 ' 10 '' and my feet hang off . i was pretty surprised how short they were 
it 's a handle on the outside.. no cord 
very comfortable to lay in . i find that opening the recliners makes it even more comfortable . 
its 10.43 in sq x 11.02 in h 
i have found them to be very sturdy and very attractive 
i would use the small brush attachment of my vacuum cleaner to remove dust . i would not get the basket wet , as i 'm pretty sure that could damage the integrity of the woven material . ca n't say whether the basket weaving is mold resistant as i live in colorado where the relative humidity is usually in the teens ! 
i 'm not at home right now but they are a large square maybe 12 '' maybe ever bigger on all sides ? i 'll check when i get home 
it feels like a heavier cotton , very nice and comfortable . hope this helps 
i think it 's some cotton and polyester

not yet available on amazon . 
not available on amazon yet . 
it is a little firm but not too firm . the back cushions are more plush and soft than the bottom cushions so it 's a nice balance . the back cushions are stitched in place so they stay in place . the fabric feels like real suede . it 's a very comfortable couch . 
22 1 2 inches from the the bottom of the back cushions to the front of the seat cushions . 
do n't know about 30 '' , but my doorway is 32 '' wide and we had no problem at all moving this in . 
do not know . had to refuse delivery . would not fit thru the door 
it is made of solid hard wood , means real wood .

yes , the filter pushes air through a charcoal pre filter & gt ; a hepa filter & gt ; uv light . all of which are replaceable . it 's recommended to replace the pre charcoal and hepa filter every 6 months or so depending on use and how contaminated the air is . it 's also recommended to take a vacuum to the filter every month to pull out the larger particles that may be lodged in it and extend filter life . when i looked for replacements they were not available on amazon , but easily purchased through the manufacturer 's website . 
it has n't changed much , it 's a bit loud , i keep it on low unless i 'm not there then put on higher ... 
no 
i just measured mine : 11 inches high 7.5 inches deep 6.5 inches wide 
the cadr is 64 . 
this unit does not seem to produce ozone , which is often evidenced by a metalic odor . hepa filters come in grades and as this is a low price point do n't expect too much . no idea of the modle number differences . made in china ? not sure but it still smells of poorly formulated plastic weeks after receiving the unit . 
no it is metal and it never had a odor that i ever noticed . 
there is no `` indicator light . '' it kind of looks like there 's one on the `` germguardian '' label on the lower right of the front of the cleaner , but it 's merely a shiny decoration . the only light to see ( a wee little ) is ... ... .. if you push in the little button on the front that says `` uv '' during running it , you can barely make out a little blue shining way inside the grill . you may need to have a somewhat darkened room , and move your head around to see the pale blue light of the uv bulb inside . it 's mostly shielded but a little light does sneak out . this is giving off uv so do n't be staring in there too long ! that bulb only comes on while it 's in low medium high mode , not when `` off '' ( even if the uv button is in . it goes out in off mode ) the uv is a germ mold spore killer . the bulb only uses about two watts so it 's not an electric concern . if you are turning clockwise , it goes ... . off , low , med , high . ( unlike some window fans that go off , to high , then med , then low . i do n't know why big window fans start at off , and go to high first . ( perhaps a big power boost to start the heavy fan moving . ) to shut it off , you go counter clockwise from high to med to low to off . if you are getting `` off '' as you turn switch all the way counter-clockwise , that 's correct . ( a black dot lines up with the uv button for correct off position . ) the symbols that line up with the `` uv '' button are ... . black dot ( off ) one line ( l ) =low . two lines ( ll ) = medium . three lines ( lll ) = high . the manufacturer says this runs at approx 56 watts ( small regular light bulb equivilant ) . but on medium setting it 's less , and on low it probably uses maybe around 20 watts . my electricity is about 9 cents per kwh generation , plus 6 cents delivery to equal 15 cents per kwh . for me , it would run about $ 6.13 a month running 24 7 at high setting . i only run high a few hours a day and low the rest of the time . that should work out to around 3 to 4 bucks a month . if i 'm out of the house for the day . i shut it off . 
yes , as long as you do n't expect it to blow your hair back . it is also pretty quiet . 
uv is on when the button is in , off when it 's out . when it 's on there 's a light that 's kinda hard to see through the front inside . 
hello , we do n't have the rights outside the usa so we can only ship within the usa . thank you david 
thank you for your interest in this bedding set . i am disappointed to say that this bedding set comes in the queen size only at this time . 
we currently only have us rights and we are trying to expand those rights !

90 x 92 inches for the queen size comforter and 20 x 26 inches for each standard size pillow sham . thank you for your interest . 
mine is queen , why ca n't amazon answer this ?

good question . i do not know the answer . on the bottom of the box it does say made in china . i kinda feel duped because i the glass is `` embossed '' with the word nantucket glassware co. est 1918. on the other hand , this has been happily used nonstop since it arrived . i did purchase the `` better '' spigot suggested and installed it without even trying the plastic spigot . 
i use this as an excellent vessel for continuous brew kombucha and cover the top with a gauze cloth . for water kefir you want air tight for second ferment but i feel like this would be big for water kefir . i do a quart at the time and you want to do the second ferment in a bottle that it nearly fills . the less air in the bottle for second ferment the more bubbles you will get as well . i recommend you join the group on facebook `` kefir grains , scoby and others to share '' , they are an excellent resource . yes you use a tight weave cloth for first ferment and air tight for second ferment if you do a second . i do a second if i add flavor like juice or fruit . also on pinterest there are fermentation boards with a wealth of information . amazon has several great products for fermentation . 
if the jar is shut tight , there will be condensation . that is a natural occurrence . 
i got the stainless works stainless steel beverage dispenser replacement spigot ( polished finish ) and it fits great . it 's more durable and pulp , etc does n't clog it like the plastic ones . it costs more , but worth it . 
sorry mine did not come with the fruit infuser . 
i usually order the usa made ( supposedly ) glass from the oneida website , but this was something that i was looking for . 
i bought this because we 're making kombucha and needed another large container to keep us from running out ! this is a nice dispenser , though we did change out the plastic for a stainless spigot , ( just our preference ) . it 's taller than our other and thinner and takes up less counter space so we may go back and get another . i recommend this . 
this is it : stainless works stainless steel beverage dispenser replacement spigot ( polishe & # 8203 ; d finish ) it is 13.95 currently . 
it 's glass ... you would have to add ice ... i use mine for kombucha.. so i really do n't know 
sorry i do n't know . i found the replacement spigot by reading the reviews for the jar . hope that helps ! 
made in china . 
we have used this when doing chicken , and deer . we have sealed for several hours already and have had no issues i think we had it running for about 2 hours and still worked great the next time , you just need to be careful that there is n't much liquid in if you are just doing the bags . we love ours and have used it a lot and it works great . 
your question is best answered by calling vacmaster tech support at 1-800-821-7849 . 
no , i bought mine separately . it does come with the connection for it though and an assortment of bags . 
sorry , we just got ours and have n't tried anything but regular bags . 
yes this machine can seal canning jars . mine came with hose port for doing that . enjoy the machine . 
yes- the heat time is adjustable so it works with many different bags . you do need to practice a little to find the correct setting . one hint , start low and move up . if the setting is too high the plastic melts and sticks to the heat strip . not good , and difficult to clean . 
the vicmaster pro305 i have is 15 '' wide , 12 '' deep , and 5 '' high . the power cord plugs into the right side so allow another 2 '' ( approximately ) . hope this is helpful . 
it include 30 assorted bags , accessory hose for canisters and a maintenance kit . thanks . 
yes , this will work with foodsaver bags . you will save a lot of money by using foodvacbags or vacmaster bags , though . they are much less expensive . 
seller can probably make almost any size . i purchased an 8 gallon 
how many gallons is this still ? 
the first part can be deadly , be sure to perform some homework before operating . this machine works great every time , highly recommend the product . simple but time consuming . 
no , i can not get all the juice out of a lemon using this ; however , i do like the ease of use and the juice i do get ... .to get all the juice out of a lemon you would need to use a lemon press . 
yes of course , you can use a small lime and it does not have to be big citrus . its inner diameter is about 2.5 inch and if citrus is too big , you can always cut in half and use . any further questions , please feel free to contact us . 
this works great for fruits smaller than 3 inches in diameter , so definitely lemons and limes and smaller oranges . i originally purchased this for blood oranges , and it works great for those . most oranges are going to be larger than 3 inches in diameter , though , and wo n't physically fit in this juicer without hanging out the sides . 
china 
this is a heavy duty squeezer , probably the toughest utensil i own , so i think you would be ok with a scrubbie since it is made of stainless steel , but so far i have n't had to use one . i thumb rinse after using , then stick it upright and spread apart in the dishwasher utensil holder . i am glad i paid a bit more and bought this squeezer vs. a plastic squeezer . the weight and strength of this utensil does the work of squeezing every drop from citrus . 
absolutely not . i have weaker hands every day ( 50+ women can probably relate ) and i was shocked at how little effort this takes ! you truly hardly touch it and the juice comes pouring out . 
a llittle more then 90 degrees 
get the stainless steel the aluminum can not go through the dishwasher 
hi i would think they are oven proof glass . they do have plastic lids which would not be . i love them . the are heavy glass , easy to clean and very microwavable . i tossed all my other storage and this set is all i need . 
the similar shapes nest . but they still take up more space than you might think . you can stack the nestled sizes on top of each other . but not nearly as storage space friendly as plastic . all of that being said i still really love them ! 
if you look at other options for the same line , you 'll see that the lids are bpa free . glasslock products are all bpa free . 
i do n't know 
it is vinyl , & very pretty in the bathroom 
standard tub shower size ... 
i do n't know the specific length but it is long in the tub . i have an old tub and know nothing about new tubs but there is no way it would slip out and wet the floor . it is great : dries quickly w o any streaking . it does cling to the tub but you can carefully pull it away with no trouble . 
yes , it is 
no . but idk why that would n't work . : - ) 
product dimensions : 42 x 15.8 x 7.9 inches ; 15 pounds it was easy to put together . looks good.. serves its purpose . 
the openings will handle a 17 '' amplifier -- it 's 18+ inches , but watch out about the inside height . it is misleading . the opening is 7.25 inches high at the front , but there is a cross support about half way back which steals back an inch , so realistically , it is about 6 inches . i had to put support feet on it to raise it up about 3 4 '' to accommodate the height of my receiver . i have a 60 '' wide screen tv on it , so you be the judge as far as weight . 
the length from first to third leg braces is 38 '' 
thanks for submitting your question , i can confirm that the dimensions are 42 x 15.8 x 7.9 inches . this information can also be found on the product detail page under the `` product description '' section . have a great day ! 
i think it is probably laminate wood . definitely not plastic . i think it looks nice . i have my big new tv on my fireplace hearth and wanted it just a little higher . no i do n't make fires ! 
7 1 4 inches . we love ours , hope it works out for you ! 
i would say yes . we currently have a tv that weighs approximately 35 pounds on our stand . i would feel comfortable putting a a larger tv on this stand due to the middle beam . 
yes it will 
yes it supports a 55 '' . recently purchased to support my lg . 
the stand will easily hold about 60lbs but ... . you must make sure your assembly goes well . there is a good possibility that the assembly ( if done improperly ) will render the stand useless . 
the arm does have a pivot point with swivel capability ( minor adjustments ) , but i do not believe it is designed to be fully swiveled since the glass itself does not swivel , i.e . the rear of the glass would hit the wall before the arm could ever be parrelel with the wall . i imagine it was not designed for this due to structural integrity since the weight would no longer be fully supported by the mount . 
i just installed it . it is about 13.5 inches . make sure you use a leveler as my shelf came out a bit angled . 
cables can be channeled through both as needed . power cable to wall electrical outlet usually goes through the bottom . 
i do n't know exact dimension but it fits my son 's xbox perfectly . it is small and sleek . it is great for cable boxes , betrays , things like that . 
yes , it does swivel from side to side . 
it has to be attached at the bottom . 
yes it is designed for this type of av equipment . the shelf is 15.9 '' long , and 13.9 '' deep . hope that helps 
i like the chair and i dont think the fabric looks cheap . initially i did think it might be a cheap chair , but not because of the fabric ... . it was hard as a rock out of the box ! but , after sitting on it a dozen times , it has softened up and now i use it all the time . hope that helps ! 
the ottoman is included : ) 
it is off white or , yes , oatmeal . 
cloth 
both the legs and writing are black . 
they are coming together . 
it is 22 inches . we find keeping a throw pillow for your back is more comfortable . 
yes 
unfortunately , i do not know and i do not remember reading any number related to weight limit . a 200 pound guest has sat in it and it did not break . not sure how long it would last with such weight . 
i have it in a spare room to read a book . it is comfy and yes your feet does touch the ground . it is very light so when we have company one person can carry out to living room with no problem . 
i have 10 large mugs on mine . there are 5 more hooks on the bottom , but you ca n't really hang mugs on them . 
no it 's sturdy . 
it does n't hold deep wine glasses very well , but shallow ones are okay . 
surely you jest ! it 's made primarily for mugs and such , so i hardly think since mugs may be wet , the company would hardly make the stand of something that would rust , especially at 40 bucks a pop ! the answer is no ~ it wo n't rust ! maybe if you leave it out in the rain a few years ... .. 
yes 
it has a powder coat on it , so i think you 're pretty safe . i would n't dry wet cups on it though , just to be safe . 
my mugs are 4 inches tall and 3 inches in diameter . i hang them by the handle on the top two sets of hooks . i do n't use the bottom rack . i can hang ten this way without having to invert them . the rack can easily handle a larger diameter mug . very satisfied with the look and convenience . 
the prongs are only 3 '' long . i have some tall beer glasses ( 10 '' high ) that i would n't trust on it . a glass that measures 6 '' high fits well enough , that is probably the tallest glass i would feel comfortable placing on it . in order for the glass to not fall off , it must rest against band and the taller glasses do n't rest well . the taller the glass , the less sure i am that it will stay on . wine glasses will only `` stay '' on in certain spots . overall , i just do n't feel comfortable placing taller glasses on it so i really have n't used it that much . trying to come up with an alternate use for it . 
i only use for large coffee mugs . i think the prongs are long enough for your beer glasses , however 
it should . have n't tried it . 
yes 
roughly 65 inches by 30 inches . 
hi , it looks like the scarf in the picture but instead of the red sections being red they are actually orange . so the scarf is orange , cream , & blue . 
i have the red white and blue one and i love it ! has a creamy kind of white tho 
i sent as a gift , i can not answer the question . 
they are very flexible so you just open side or push the bottom . plus nothing sticks to them so it is easy to take everything out . they are not melting and not giving rubber smell or taste . i like to use them in baking , so easy to take cupcakes out without damaging them . 
the same size as standard paper cup cake liners . 
i think they would work well , and they are more sturdy than other ones i have used . 
they are a bit smaller than regular cupcakes but so easy to use . i have found no residual smell or taste with the muffins i 've made . feedback has been great . so far i have n't found any publications indicating a risk of transference . 
do n't know what the `` pinch test '' is but i pinched one and it does not change color nor does it squeal . : ) 
there are no markings on product or information in insert as to where they are made . you might try contacting the company through their website . 
the manual is actually included in the design of the packaging box : ) however , if you have more questions regarding the use of the product , contact us and we will be more than happy to assist you . 
hi emily , most fruits and vegetables are very easy to keep `` centred '' as long as the foodstuff is impaled firmly on the spikes . also , it hardly wobbles when you turn the handle . we do not suggest using the dishwasher for this product but many customers have done so successfully . 
my mother has this in her kitchen and she 's been using it for months now . from what i 've seen , it works really well and her vegetable slices look really good when she uses this . we have tried the paderno before and i have n't noticed much difference . this is less expensive though but not too cheap . that 's why we bought this . it has worked incredibly well for our meals so far . i recently bought another one for my own kitchen . i would buy this if i were you . 
i have n't tried to put it in the dishwasher i just wash it by hand . 
i agree ! i plan to write a description on each in a permanent marker ( fine tip sharpie ) such as `` curls '' or `` thick spirals '' to help me tell them apart . 
instructions on how to use this product is actually printed on the packaging box : ) if you have any more questions , please message us and we will be more than happy to assist you . 
the amazon dimensions are the shipped package and the seller dimensions are the actual product dimensions . 
interior measurements : 12.5 '' x 12.2 '' x 10.2 '' ( lxwxh ) 
excellent . it does run hot so check your chicken before your normal time that you are use to in your regular oven . mine works better than my oven ever did . 
the rack must be pulled forward , similar to a conventional oven . it is not attached . 
yes we have a layer of aluminum foil at the bottom of the tray . just keep it away from the heat elements . which is not a problem normally.hope that makes sense . 
the answer from winecountrylover is correct . i have had this oven for a few months and i would not buy it again . in addition to the flaw mentioned in my previous review , i noticed the glass oven door does not close tightly so heat must be escaping . 
we have n't placed our thermometer in it , but it seems to be holding the temperature setting accurately . it is small enough that baking is even , no notable hot or cold zones . 
no 
the instruction book says the drip pan is porcelain enamel ... seems like all the interior is the same type metal ( made in china ) -- i love my rosewill ! ! 
i liked the nomiku because of the way it hooks to the pot , and it is a little more powerfull which will mean that it will cycle less while keeping the temperature where you want it . i had a few questions and the factory people were very responsive , unlike anova who ignored my email questions prior to my selection . have fun ! i use it at least 3 to 4 times a month now , instead of cooking fish in parchment , i use the plastic bag , which i can preload with stuff , and freeze , then unthaw a little and drop in the pot , comes out great ! 
they currently only have the north american version availabe . the international version ( 240v ) is awaiting ce certification . according to their kickstarter page , it should be available in a few months . as of june 2014 , they are shipping international versions ( available from their website ) . not sure when they will make it to amazon though ... .. 
you can definitely use this without a vacuum sealer . what you do is what is called the 'displacement ' method . put the food in a quart or gallon zip lock - then seal up most of the zip , leaving just a bit at the end . then , submerge the bag slowly in a pot of water - which will push all the air out . just as the zip lock is getting to the water line , seal it and you should be good to go . 
the sound produced is barely noticeable from the motor including the impeller . sometimes the water circulation can make a little noise moving around the food items . 
this is a question about sous vide , not nomiku . either way , it is just a case of ensuring you use food-safe bags or vacuum packs . and a little bit of common sense to not use any toxic plastics in a hot sous-vide . as would be the case in any type of food preparation : - ) 
go to chefstep.com and take the sous vide course , you 'll learn much more in 30 min . than from any cook book ... 
i can not speak to the sansaire product . i can tell you that the folks at nomiku replaced my product for free when i damaged the unit with a lit burner . it works flawlessly , is easy to use and had never had a problem with it holding temp . i would n't recommend anything else . 
no it wo n't , i do n't think has the power needed for this amount of water 
yes 
yes , the screen displays the set to temp and the temp of the water . 
it 's mdf , not real wood . manufactured wood , read the spec 's 
14 w , 22 l , 6 d 
as close as i can figure , about 10 pounds . 
no 
you should have a extra wood piece also 
no , the door can not open left . 
one shelf is fixed but you can likely leave that out when building the cabinet . top and bottom have the same finish , so that would n't be a concern . only thing is that you would have to come up with a different method of mounting it to the wall , the original design will not work . the original design is for the cabinet to just hang on a separate ( included ) piece of wood that is anchored to the wall . 
yes 
yes 
hello , it is w13.8 x d5.9 x h21.6 inches , thank you 
suggest to use it in a small closed room , not larger then 180sq feet ( 8'h ) . 2times of 15 min . 
ozone is harmful to humans in closed spaces . i wouldnt want it in my car . it has regular prongs for a regulr electric outlet . you can buy an ozone spray for neutralizing air in car-safer . 
no it runs briefly and then will shut off . 
you can smell the ozone when it is working . i would guess that it would effectively work for at least five or more years . 
ozone generators work by electrically charging oxygen ( o2 ) and converting it into ozone ( o3 ) . one of the big advantages of this product is that it it does n't run constantly . by turning itself off it saves on wear and tear . thanks . 
yes , fan engages when ozone is generated 
hi janet . this unit does not have filters that need to be replaced . thanks . 
i think it generates the ozone from oxygen 
yes , it should work fine . keep in mind the system generates pure oxygenated air which has a certain scent we are obviously not used to due to all the impurities we breath in all day however , since you do notice the difference once the ugly odors are gone . you can air out the rv by simply opening the door for a few minutes after the system is off and voila ! and the pure oxygenated air will dissipate a bit . voila ! fresh clean rv 
regular outlet in household . unit is small but powerful . i have used it for cigarette smoke and food smells . works well . i like that i can set the time it runs and intervals for stop and start 
the clearance is three and three-quarters inches . i have a mix of opi , essie , china glaze , orly , etc . everything fits easily . ciate need to racked at an angle but there is no height problem . hope that helps . 
no , easy to put up though . 
we bought 2 and they were both broken even though the boxes showed no signs of damage . 
yes 
3-3 4 `` , but there is a 3 4 '' lip on the bottom of each shelf to keep the polish from falling . 
it 's 24 '' long tall and about 19.5 '' -20 '' wide . 
i 'm not sure of the dimensions of mini liquid bottles . if they are as big as a regular size bottle of polish they should work just fine . the shelf polish rack is very thick plastic , very sturdy so it will handle the weight . 
they would not fall out but they might fall over if knocked or tiped 
the racks are open from end to end . 
it has 4 holes for mounting . we found a stud to mount it to on both sides . then put them over each other . if you had to you could use anchors the wait is vertical so it hangs rather than pulls allowing for much better wait capacity . just do n't over tighten , it could crack . 
14.5 '' , 5.5 '' , 8 '' 
nope 
they are wide enough for artisan breads but no bagels . hope that helps . but fyi i returned this bc bread english muffins fell off the lifter ( whatever its called ) and got stuck almost every time and to get it out you have to cut the bread into tiny pieces while its stuck in there and its rediculous ! plus even if you dont have to dig your bread out , the crumb catcher doesnt work my counter was a disaster i wrote a negative review i would not recomend this at all . 
coils , and it broke 
the aluminum was sandwiched between two stainless steel layers . the bottom stainless steel layer is magnetic making this cookware induction compatible . 
bought this set for my son he loves it and he is very picky.. anywhere else this set is very expensive.. i believe it is high quality stainless . 
this quality build product is manufactured in china . 
yes , all of the duxtop stainless steel cookware sets are designed to work with induction cooktops . 
yes , that is what i use , and i love my pans ! 
the saut pan is 11 '' diameter and no , the lids do not fit the 10 '' & 8 '' fry pan . it is a great set , i love it . 
yes , although i generally wash by hand . 
i do n't understand your question . 
i have n't had a problem with scrambled eggs but did with something else . i used barkeepers friend and a non-scratch scrubber with excellent results . hope this helps . 
dear lindsay , these come with flat bottom , and it is designed for working on flat glass-top stove . thank you . 
regular cupcakes ( not muffins ) will fit in this , but the only way you can get one in is by either not having icing on it , or knowing the icing will be messed up . 
you can slightly tilt to place cup cake in the holder . but i suggest removing the holder from the hook on the carousel , then place the cupcake in the holder and hook it back to the carousel . 
muffins do not fit . the only thing that fits is a cupcake , with little or no icing . 
the measurements are in the description : `` product dimensions : 18 x 7 x 13 inches '' . 18 '' is the height . 
the brand name on the box is francois et mimi . nothing says godinger on it . 
it looks like my francois et mimi 
this item is currently fulfilled by amazon when buying select next day shipping to get it on tuesday , good luck 
it does rotate freely . it would not hold bowls . a regular sized cupcake barely fits in the metal cups . they are quite small . 
light beige 
no 
at work now ... when i get home around 5:45 i can message and let you know . 
the green is more of a dark sage with some olive in the leaves . our bedroom is painted olive green and it does brighten up the room . it will keep you warm . i added some extra brown and olive green pillow from my previous bedspread and the colors bend so well together . sorry if this is more information than you needed . 
i do n't know i was buy these for my grand parents . i didnt see any curtians when i was looking but i was told it 's a really nice set . 
i do n't think so 
unfortunately we do not carry the full size . 
this model does n't come with a milling blade - i just got it today and ran a few tests , it seems to do just fine with the regular blade . i turned both flax seeds and oatmeal into powder 
i have both . the vitamix is gathering dust . sure it can make soup ... like 1 recipe ( all the other ones require prep work like steam something first , who wants that ) . so for the 99 % of the job , making smoothies , this is 90 % as powerful and will crush ice and frozen foods just like a vitamix . the only downside is size . we almost always use the 1 collossal cup and we fill it up way past the limit line . but it wont ' make as much as a vitamix if you plan on making smoothies for 4 people . but the upside is the speed of cleaning . it actually might be faster and easier to just make 2 smoothies vs cleaning the vitamix . so go get it , if you have n't already . and do n't get the 600 , get the 900 . 
i have both nutribullet and vitamix . i 've also had a dedicated juicer which i gave away ... too much trouble . anyway , nutribullet works almost as well as vitamix without having to take up so much counterspace . also i believe the `` juices '' taste better when you keep the fiber in . way more filling . admittedly i ca n't give you any advice about the ninja but i do believe you ca n't go wrong with nutribullet . 
yes , all the cups are universal and work with each other 
i believe you have to get one that is for uk electrical wattage . 
if you want actual juice extract ... where the pulp is separated from the juice and you are left with only juice..no , it does n't do that , as all fruits and vegetables are chopped in the same container . however , it is blends very finely , so that you can drink it without noticing any pulp ; , but it 's not the pure juice that a juicer makes . however , if you just want to make sure it can turn veggies into something drinkable ... yes , it does that . i have a vitamix and i am very impressed how well this compares to the vitamix . had i bought this first , i would n't have bought the vitamix . i bought this as something i could travel with . 
you bet it is worth the money . but keep looking for the lowest price available . 
i do more veggies than fruit also . i believe they do not recommend you store it for more than a few hours . i always try to drink mine right away in 15 - 20 minutes . depending on the vegetables , you could cut them up and freeze them , ( freeze on a cookie sheet on parchment paper and then bag up once frozen ) and then every morning take out just the frozen chunks you want to use , which also makes the drink cold without using ice . it 's no big deal to just make and then drink and clean up is super easy . i find this very quick and easy to use on a drink by drink basis . 
the nutribullet pro 900 watt has fewer problems than the 600 watt 
yes 
no , i have not used bananas . i usually use frozen frozen fruit with sugar-free fat-free vanilla yogurt . the yogurt makes the texture to be smooth and creamy . i evenly mix the frozen fruit with yogurt and splenda first before adding the ingredients down in the the shoot . 
i found that it is cremier with bananas , however you can still get a fairly creamy texture from using other fruits ( comes out like a sherbert or sorbet ) . i tried mine with just froze watermelon , cantelope , and pineapple and it was great ! healthy rainbow sherbert ! 
could n't be easier . you just cutup and freeze fruit the night before , or buy bagged , frozen friend . shove the pieces of frozen fruit into the shoot , press the button and out comes frozen desert ( like sorbet ) ... .i do n't add anything , no sugar , etc . perfect if you crave ice cream but are watching calories ... ..one of the best items i ever bought ! 
it does come with recipes . tried them and everything that it produced was disappointing . nothing that looked anything like what the one in the commercial made for sure . 
hi . it 's sturdy , easy to use & clean when done . i defrost for about 1 2 to an hour then put in slowly great treat . & healthy ! : ) 
i may be the wrong person to ask . the serving size can be what you want it to be . all the machine does is crush whatever you put into it to make a bowl of of mush . i was n't pleased with the machine , you need to add vanilla every time you use it . if you want `` frozen '' desert mixed you need to either mix them prior or keep putting them back through the machine . i find my blender does a better job than this . i wish i could return it . sorry for the bad review , but if i read this statement i would have never bought it . everyone is different though . i hope this helps . 
about half a dozen , there are two types of spigot , one for curly , the other tube-shaped fruit . there is the feeder tube , a screw that goes inside it , a hopper , and a hopper cone . i just tried it last night , it rinses off nicely if you do it right away . you can wash it in warm slightly soapy water , then rinse . the recipes are kinda odd , some of them . all you really need is a partially frozen small to medium sized banana sliced up , and one cup of partially frozen fruit of your choice . mix them by hand in a bowl first , otherwise you get all banana or all fruit out the spigot . frozen fruit that comes in a bag at the store works fine , fresh fruit frozen slightly ( about an hour for the fruit and banana , depending on your freezer ) tastes better . 
i love the magic bullet ! ! ! ! ! 
it does . it 's smaller than i thought- it looks more like a pamphlet , but it has a lot of good recipes and contains a thawing guide for the fruit you use . i 've found the thawing time really makes a difference in the consistency . the book also gives you some of the nutrition information about each recipe , like the calorie count and the number of diabetic exchanges . 
andrea , we bought one a few months ago . you do n't need the yogurt , too much added sugar and calories , we just use frozen fruit , all different kinds and i add parts of a banana , not frozen for a more creamier texture . it 's delicious , and if you want add mini chocolate chips on top mix with a little whipped cream , omg way better than ice cream and for people who have an intolerance to milk products , it wins hands down . enjoy 
very durable should lsst 10 more years 
it does have a dough hook , but i 've never used it for that , but i would assume so 
yes , there is a food processor attachment thay does that . it 's fantastic . 
110 
i have ground almonds to make a pastry crust . it did n't come out super fine but was adequate for my purpose . i think i 'd depend on how fine you need it . 
it 's hard plastic , durable and easy to clean 
no sorry 
not that i know of 
i do n't know about the mega system but mine - the ultra kitchen system 1200 - does not have a grating attachment . 
no , i do n't think they have those 
it 's a throw size , approximately 50 x 60 
it 's `` lap '' size - 50 '' w x 60 '' d 
i purchases 2 of these throws for my daughter 's birthday . she has had them since february 1. she brought one down last weekend and it looked perfect . however , i do n't know whether or not she has washed it . they are very pretty ! 
yes they can be sharpened but i have not had to do anything to them yet except wash them . they are still very very sharp . 
the guards are solid color ... same color as the knife 's handle 
i have not had those issues as of yet and i hand wash my knives after use . 
they 're plastic and match the handle . 
they are not titanium blades , they are titanium coated ( probably titanium carbon nitride or titanium aluminium nitride ) . if they are decent stainless underneath they should not rust . 
the titanium is a coating or plating . the knives are magnetic only because the steel the titanium is bonded to is magnetic . the titanium itself is not magnetic . that is why artificial joints ( like knee or hip replacement joints ) will pass through an airport metal detector without going off . when staples or other internal fastenings are used internally , they use titanium . titanium is a poor conductor of heat and of electricity . 
mine are still sharp , but there in no reason they can not be sharpened . i have full plans on sharpneing them once they get dull ; i love these knives . even ordered more as a gift to family . 
by the balance and the weight i would say yes they do . it is an easy grip but firm . 
amazingly sharp .

this model has 2 controllers and , therefore , that have 2 separate outlets . 
have you covered your blanket with a another blanket ? that will cause it to flash an error message and shut off 
sorry i do n't have a clue i bought it as a gift for my son and his wife 
the scord from the bottom of the blanket to the control is about 10 feet the power cord from the controller to the outlet is about five and a half feet 
thanks for your question ! this listing is for the vanilla color . we also have the deep red available on the site . you can view the listing here : www.amazon.com dp b00awdyujm i hope this helps ! 
we love ours too ! however we have had casulaties with it too . this is our 3rd now . we feel that that perhaps it must not be tucked in tightly any where . we just leave the blanket on top of the sheets and that spread lays loose over it . the last time it was a problem we just unlugged it and replugged it in and it worked . we feel it must not be confined anywhere on the bed . hope this helps and we hope ours will last more that one year . 
mine is a queen size with dual controls . each side has it 's own settings and i love the preheat feature . when you turn it on it goes to your last set number but just push the button a second time for preheat . 
actually that is exactly how i use it . i have a mattress pad , the fitted sheet , the flat sheet , the electric blanket and another sheet over it because we have a dog who is 200 pounds who gets into our bed and i do not want him to sleep directly on the electric blanket . it has worked for both my husband , myself and the dog . you will find that a blanket on top of the electric blanket will make it retain heat better and you will not need to set the number so high for warmth . 
i have never gotten an f. i do get a p which means preheat . 
yes 
hello , thanks for your question . according to the information available for this heated blanket on a supplier 's website , this blanket is machine washable . have a great day ! 
no 
if you buy from different vendors the tablecloths will most likely look different . we recommend calling us tomorrow @ 800-238-0005 if you need further clarification . 
yes . they are made from the same fabric . 
thanks for your question , according to the product description , the care instructions are : `` hand wash or dry clean only '' . i hope this helps ! 
5 foot round is 60 inches . no hang over 
hi , yes we have a reduced shipping rate for each additional poster that you purchase . please see our shipping fees page . 
if you choose the expedited shipping option we ship through the usps and the usps says it should reach you in 3-5 business days . if you just choose regular shipping it will be more like 5-7 business days . postal transit times can be greatly affected by weather and distance . please keep in mind that we ship from rural texas . hope that helps answer your question . 
hi , the poster is 24x36 inches , the `` standard '' poster size , and it is made out of a standard glossy paper , looks like nice quality . 
mattresses are not included . i do n't think it would fit a twin xl . i bought regular twin mattresses and they fit perfectly . i went with an 8 inch thick mattress on the top ( you could go a little larger ) and a 6 inch on the bottom ( you could go up to 7 inches but i do n't think 8 inches will fit ) 
its faux leather and it looks great . it 's not shiny . it 's a nice clean lines . the texture is clean not bumpy or weird . looks like a ralph lauren design due to he clean lines and dimensions . i get a lot of compliments for it and people are surprised its faux leather . super happy with it . did n't expect i would like it so much . 
no . it pulls out and ends up being below the other mattress . 
it 's a clean white color . not so white that it looks bleached out . nice and bright and i am super happy with the quality and the size . it 's not overly thick on the sides . the white is a nice leather white color . not cream . 
the bed is 89 x 44 x 48 high . 
to tell you the truth , i never finished it . i use it in the office . it runs for about 8hrs or less then i take it apart when i leave . i think it depends on how big of a water bottle you use . it has n't broken down on me yet . so it 's been good so far . 
i bought evian , fit perfect , they said even if it does n't fit it should work ... ... i guess not 
all the time . the 2nd time i tried to use it did n't work any more . the idea of the product was better than the real product . do n't buy 
it has to be plugged in . 
about 3 ft ? ? 
10-12days from china . 
4.7 inches , my friend 
no 
no , i hardly notice it running and it 's totally worth the investment . thinking about ordering another one for my nightstand ! 
i do n't know.. i think it would.. sometimes i have problems with water with high dissolved solids in the water.. distilled waterworks the best.. but some do say they do work with oils.. 
machine wash cold , tumble dry low 
thanks for your question ! this comforter is queen size . the same one is also available in king size here : http : www.amazon.com dp b00hb9gpjs i hope this helps ! 
it is made of polyester . 
this product is fulfilled by amazon , and apo uses usps rates apply , so this should not be a problem . 
when i first got them i had to wash them like six plus times to get rid of all the lint . after that they are great . soak up well and stay thick and pretty soft . 
there 's no reference to being organic on any website that i checked . they are dyed however as stated . i personally recommend the 900 gram egyptian cotton towels . expensive but they last ... and are incredibly soft and absorbent . i warm them briefly in my large microwave for 30-45 seconds . hope this helps a bit . 
no , it stays flat . it 's a very nice towel . 
i am sorry , could you articulate your question again , as i am not able to understand what it is you are asking me about the towels . thank you . 
i always put a small amount of bleach in with the towels and sheets regardless of their color . it kills germs from the body . 
the bath towels are 27 '' x54 '' , the hand towels are 16 '' x30 '' , and the wash cloths are 13 '' x13 '' . the white bath sheets are 30 '' x60 '' 
27 '' x54 '' 
yes 
yes , just place an order of 4 for this item that will come out 4 x 10 = 40 units of knobs in total . regards , - tapp collections management 
yes , currently there are 13 left in stock . we 're refilling them and should have more in stock by the end of this week . regards , - tapp collections management 
weight is a force . it is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration . 
yes ! i have 3 cats and they kick litter up like crazy , this pulls it right out of the carpet . 
target and sears carry them . 
a short vacuum brush , a short brushless wide vacuum brushand a 1 & 1 2 foot flat vacuum tube . that 's it . 
it is not specifically self propelled but the brush spins hard enough to pull it ! best vaccume i have ever owned 
not for the rocket . it works beautifully on hard floors and is very light weight 
yes it will 
i found them on amazon . 
yes . it works well on any flat , hard floor . 
i put it in my dishwasher and it came out as good as new 
4x9.5x21 4 deep 
i used it for making soap , however it held 1 pound . hope this helps 
sylicone is not plastic . it does not contain pba . 
it has n't yet and i have made meatloaf several times and loaf cakes . you just have to be very careful when you remove it from the oven as it is not stable . but i still love it because it is so easy to clean and the ridges in the bottom keep the meatloaf from sitting in the grease from the meat . 
i have no idea . 
i confirmed this is a sharp carousel r659yw 2.2 cu . ft. 1200w countertop microwave oven 
push the power button once then each time you push it , it will show a decrease 90 % , 80 % etc . once you get the level you want , program in time and push start . ( 30 % is defrost ) 
suggest you call 1-800-237-4277 for sharp customer information . they 've answered all my questions so far and i 'm sure they will help you . i find that it 's more powerful than my previous sharp , but am liking it a lot . 
it is 13 '' tall ( not including the feet levelers , 24 '' wide , 17 & 7 8 ( almost 18 '' front to back . 
the specifications show , width 17.1 '' depth 18.9 '' height 11.5 '' 
i like it very much ! easy to use and clean . definitely recommend it if you are looking for a large microwave . 
use a regular microwave cooker , as you would for veggies . the potato express is n't worth your time or money . 
no , you do n't cut or puncture the potato . just rinse it off and place it into the potato cover . there are instructions with the potato cover . 
there are two separate packages 
no 
no . you really do n't need a recipe . just microwave the potatoes in the glove . they come out just like baked potatoes but in a much shorter time . potatoes can be microwaved without the glove but the product is less moist . be sure to turn over as they direct , half way thru the cook time . 
hello , how are you ? thank you for your interest in our item . they come in one height only . pierre 
hello ! how are you ? thank you for your interest in our item . yes , this item is for wooden shelfs . we will change the photo momentarily . happy holidays ! pierre 
probably only about the thickness shown in the photo - i actually returned mine bc my shelves are a little over an inch thick and the dividers did n't fit . 
there is no back vertical bar , these are just side dividers . 
good morning amy ! thank you for your interest in our item . just the divider part . happy new year ! pierre 
it is metallic . but not a bright red . 
no , just the large one . no other will work either . 
if the bowl is properly positioned , it spins automatically . there is a lever in the base to change the turntable position ; move it toward the front to accommodate the larger bowl . be sure to insert the beaters dough hooks so the narrower dough hook or the more cone-shaped beater ( with the nylon `` button '' on the bottom ) is against the side of the bowl . read your instruction sheet thoroughly . 
yes . 
i really do n't know . it was given to a family member as a christmas present . i know they love it and use it a lot but i will get back with you after i contact them . 
it has six 1 2 inch rubber grippers and is about 13 1 2 inches long x 10 inches wide x 14 1 2 inches tall . it weighs about 8 lbs which includes all three sets of beaters 
i would venture to say the answer is `` no '' because it is to be used only in the us and canada . i searched throughout all of the instructions and nowhere did i find the information you are looking for . they have a website at www.sunbearm.com or you may call their customer service at 1-800-458-8407 ( us ) or 1-800-667-8623 ( canada ) . i am sorry i could not be of more help . hopefully you will contact them ! may you have a blessed day ? 
yes it does spin 
do n't know the exact weight but it 's heavy enough to be stable when using it . it does n't tip over . it was given as a christmas gift so i called the receiptant and that was what she said . she said she liked it very much . 
i have not used the mixer for dough as of yet , , however i did use cookie dough and it seemed to do well using the dough utensils . 
you should calibrate any thermometer but if you are getting weird readings try changing the battery . acurite recommends a basic alkaline not a heavy duty . this worked for mine . 
the main unit has a strong magnetic back . 
i just used it in my grill . you have to watch the temp of the grill . the black insulator on the probe dissolved from the heat . the probe is supposed to be good for 750 deg . my grill thermometer read about 500 deg . it could have been hotter . 
yes . directions are in the manual 
i have not tried it yet in wet weather , however i will use it in raining weather ... . 
degrees are degrees , whether it be air , oil or water . this one is rated above 600 degrees . but , i have only used it in conventional oven . 
they have a limited one year warranty . i purchased this the end of july . the very first time i used it the probe went bad . i just threw it in the box figuring it was just another piece of junk . i ran across it last week in the garage so i thought i would give them a call . they had me send them proof of purchase and said they would send me a new probe . it has only been a couple of days so i have n't received it yet . the lady was very nice in customer service . 
as long as you have a holder for the probe so it does not go in . 
both the main unit and the pager alert . i have been very pleased with this purchase . the pager has a clip for your belt and if i need to run back into the house for something i am alerted . love this device ! 
the screen is blank when powered off . what you are seeing is stenciled on the screen , not a digital display . 
never used it to make foam but says its good for temps up to 120. makes great whipped cream though : ) 
yes it can . it can even hold 3. when it gets to the point where it wo n't any more gas , it will come out the safety hole in the charger cap . 
it came with a cleaning brush and three nozzles . 
per the instruction manual that came with it , `` it is not recommended to wash in the dishwasher as this may damage the bottle and head . '' i just fill it with warm water and dishwashing soap , open the valve a bit , to clean the valve , then rinse with warm water . 
if you are using heavy whipped cream , who really cares ? 
yes if you are making whipped cream , add one charge and shake it up . whipping siphins can be used for much more . bread to hollandaise mousse and that 's just using nitrous . 
no 
yes . you can use as little as you want and just adjust the amount of sugar you add to the liquid accordingly . 
if it fits yea ... but in order to whip cream you 'll need nitrous because of the chemistry . co2 charge ( food grade ) to make carbonated liquids . 
yes , it is ; except for the plastic nozzle where the whipped cream comes from and a rubber ring to seal in the pressure inside . i usually put all in the dishwasher and never a problem . i love it and have given several away and everyone loves it too ! 
yes no sound at all unless you put the fan on 
there is a seperate power button switch that controls the humidifier on the back of the fan . when the tank level gets low , it shuts off automatically . 
yes on both ! ! ! great fan ! ! ! 
no , broken 
measuring from side to side , across the center , the circle is 14 inches . 
worst customer service and horrible experience - not the answer you were looking for - but still the truth 
it has both features , which can operate independently or at the same time . depending on the size of the room , the effectiveness as a humidifier may be reduced ( the manual rates its area of coverage at 500 sq ft ) , but i would rate it as comparable to a standard ultrasonic humidifier . 
120v 
according to the manual , the fan is 55w , and the cool mist humidifier is 35w . they can be run together or separately . 
hello , i hope this message finds you well . each chalkboard sticker label pack contains 2 sheets which are 8.6 '' x 11 '' . one sheet contains 6 pieces . each chalkboard label is 3.6 '' x 2.6 '' . please feel free to contact us if you have any other questions . thank you . 
they are all the same size but different shapes.. they are really neat.. i really like them 
no 
hello ashley , i hope this message finds you well . the total chalkboard labels is 12. they come in a pack containing 2 sheets which are 8.6 '' x 11 '' . one sheet contains 6 pieces . each chalkboard label is 3.6 '' x 2.6 '' . the shapes are based on a rectangular frame with varying degrees of rounded edges . please see the photos for some examples of the chalkboard stickers . please feel free to contact us if you have any other questions . thank you 
yes , as long as it 's dry when it 's put on . at least it has stayed on for me . 
hello carolyn , yes the chalkboard labels can be used on plastic containers . as the stickers have an adhesive back , they are suitable for most smooth surfaces . customers have even used the chalkboard labels on baskets to help organize storage areas . all the best . 
it has an ionic feature which can be turned on or off . it is a true hepa air purifier , and it works great . 
the instructions say to clean the filters every 3 months and replace the hepa filter every 18 months 
yes it will helps with the smell dramatically . the cloths of the smoker will still smell but the lingering smell in the air will disappear . 
the biogs spa-550a uses 5 to 29 watts ( energy star ) and the voltage is 120v . 
dear christine , thank you for your interest in rabbit air . the power requirements for the biogs 2.0 models are only 120v ac 60 hz . have a great day ! regards , customer care team rabbit air 
dear david , thank you for contacting rabbit air . the biogs 2.0 air purifier is our newest and completely redesigned air purifier , but the minusa2 air purifier is our stronger model air purifier as it can cover a larger area and it has more filters . the minusa2 air purifier is recommended for those with more severe air quality problems . if you have any other questions or concerns , please feel free to contact us . thank you and have a wonderful day ! 
dear katy , thank you for contacting us . the biogs 2.0 models use a 2-prong plug . we do not recommend the air purifier facing the wall , instead , we recommend having at least 1 foot of clearance of the wall . the unit will work best in an area with a high amount of concentrated particles . have a great day ! regards , rabbit air customer care team 
korea 
hello , c.j.e ! with average indoor air quality and 24 hour daily use , the filters in the biogs 2.0 will last for 18 months . if you have any other questions please feel free to let us know ! regards , the rabbit air team 
i set it on auto a long time ago , but as i remember the low med high setting was for the sensitivity setting . with the sensitivity set to high on auto , it comes on when the dog walks by and the fan speed starts low and gets higher if it detects more air contamination . 
`` all of our air purifiers have been tested to comply within the ozone safety requirements set forth by california air resources board . our biogs model emits zero ozone when the negative ion generator is on or off and our minusa2 emits zero ozone on all speeds once you have turned off the negative ion generator . an amount of 0.002 ppm ( parts-per-million ) was recorded at low fan speed of our minusa2 with the negative ionizer turned on . that is 25 times less than the 0.05 ppm maximum ozone concentration safety standard set forth by the california air resources board . '' - http : www.rabbitair.com faq.aspx 
for this model , the cadr is as follows : 189 pollen 165 dust 152 smoke this comes from their website : http : www.rabbitair.com biogs-2-ultra-quiet-hepa-air-purifier.aspx 
about every 18 months ... 
it 's a great product i use it in a 500sqft room and it works well . if you have multiple rooms i think you would need additional units . 
hi gail , thank you for your question . an interesting fact about hepa filters are that they were initially designed to prevent the spread of airborne radiation during world war ii . that being said , unfortunately , we do not know to what degree the filters will trap the radiation particles as environment and degree of particulates in the air are usually unknown without prior testing . we hope that this shed some light for you , and if you have any other questions , please feel free to contact us again . kind regards , rabbit air customer care team 
i just checked the underside and found out that it 's made in korea . 
the amount of air circulation depends on the air quality of the room . if the sensor detects low air quality , it will increase fan speed to boost air circulation . when the sensor detects good air quality , it will lower the fan speed resulting in less air circulation . you can adjust the sensitivity of the air quality sensor . in my experience , the auto setting ( the one described above ) did not clean the air as much as i needed , not even when i had the air quality sensor set to high sensitivity . actually , with my allergies asthma this is n't all that surprising . so , i set it manually . for me , keeping it on and set at the 3 star fan speed has worked just great . i 've never been able to actually breath through my nose so much ! 
dear mel , thank you for your question . we typically recommend changing the filters of the biogs 2.0 air purifier every 18 months based on average indoor air quality and 24 7 operation . it is possible you may need to replace the filters more often if you have more harsh air quality or high concentrations of air pollutants . it is normal for the color of the filter to change over time as the pollutants will be captured by the filters in the air purifier . we would recommend trying to maintain the filters more often to see if that will help . we hope this information is useful . please feel free to let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with . thank you and have a great day ! kind regards , rabbit air customer care team 
no . it 's not designed for large particulates . it may help with the very fine dust you may get while working with wood . 
hello ann ! thank you for your interest in our biogs 2.0 air purifier . this air purifier is made for the us and canadian market , so it is not suitable for 220v outlets . if you purchased within the us or canada and wish to take the air purifier to new zealand , you will need to purchase a transformer . if you have any other questions , please let us know . have a wonderful day ! regards , olivia raya rabbit air team 
well techniquely you would n't want to put this mug in the microwave because it is metal . i mean unless you were looking to explode you drink and or your microwave . however , if you heat your drink in a separate vessel , and then put it in the mug , it stays warm much longer than glass or ceramic will . 
it 's made in china . the quality is okay though . it keeps beverages hot cold for a while as it 's double-walled . 
a thermos is sealed at the opening , but a mug is n't , and it 's there where your thermal transfer will happen most . hence , vacuum insulation would likely add a pointless expense to the manufacture of the mug . for my part , i find the mug insulates really well . i get no condensation on the outside of the mug with all ice and icewater in the mug , and if i put ice and water in the mug at night and leave it by my bed , i still have ice in the morning . 
it does keep cool , i bought 2 for my husband and i. ca n't complain . 
who cares , its the best double wall insulated mug i have ever owned and it looks like a keg 
no it does n't . unless you freeze the mug 
3 1 4 `` across top x 5 '' tall 
no , it 's an open mug . 
other sites advertise that it will keep hot beverages toasty without making the handle hot . 
thanks for your question . the link to download the manual ( in pdf format ) is included with each product , so each of your gift recipients will be able to get that information . 
it will work on cucumbers . potatoes may need to be cut a little , and carrots it will do the bigger end as long as it 's bigger than about a half inch . 
zucchini works best , yellow summer squash also works really well . 
hi linda & gt ; amazon 's free shipping threshold is now $ 35 on purchases ... so you 'd have to order 3 to get the free shipping . 
the opening is approx 2 1 2 inches ... . if you had longer , narrower potatoes it would probably work well . 
i have not but it sounds like something i would like to try . i 'm sure it would work , it would just have to be sliced in half most likely . 
no 
roughly about 1-1 1 2 '' . likely you would have to cut the squash into `` sticks '' first . it is very handy but just a small hand tool . 
you should receive an email with a link . 
personally , i have never tried this with cucumber . i figure it is to water filled to stay firm enough for veggie noodles . i use zucchini . 
the inside diameter of cup is 3 inches . the height is 3 and 13 16ths of an inch . and holds a little over a pint of liquid . 
yes . 
hello vincent - china . best wishes - mike 
no , it is not . 
united states of america 120v 60hz a , b 
no . notify the company & they will send you one that has been loosened . they have to know that this is a serious problem , not a one-off . 
you can go to the bottom of a large glass , or bowl about 6-7 inches . about the same as a milk shake that you have made at a fountain . blends ok and you can chop some items in a bowl or pan . i like it for some blending it has made it easier to do . 
i would have to say maybe so , but in smaller chunks . 
2-1 2 cups 
do not know . when i received the chefman i put it together by inserting the mixer attachment . when i tried to release it and take it off it was stuck so i returned the item to amazon . 
i 'd say the cord is 4ft long ... .from my toes to my nose ! ha ha 
gently twist , it 's like a quarter twist and pull for both the handle to the lid and handle to the stick blender . it 's initially sticky out of the box . 
seriously ? it is not a guitar amp . 
it 's far better than the big jam box in terms of sound quality , design , and construction . however , it is not portable as the jambox is . the stanmore must always be plugged in and has no battery for portable play . it 's a great bluetooth system for home , the sound quality is amazing but if your looking for something to take on the go , this may not be for you . 
totally different . those are portable , this is not . sound is incomparable to those in a good way = ) 
amit . i do n't know the watts , but you 'll be able to find that answer online . it is very loud for its size . it 's adjustable , but is bass focussed . it is super clear at all volumes and all music seems to work well , although , like all other marshall products , it 's bass focused . i 'm really impressed with it ! 
yes , it comes with all of that . i had read it came with american and european electrical plug - it only comes with us plug , so you 'll have to use a plug adapter to use it overseas . 
power requirement is universal @ 100-240 volts . only the connector needs to be adapted . thanks for your interest . brian wiredforless 
no 
mine came equipped with both an american and a european power cord so i believe the answer is yes . 
it needs to be plugged in to a power source but you can bluetooth music from your phone or something . it sounds amazing by the way . worth it 
i do n't know about soundlink but i can say i completely satisfied with my marshall . tremendous sound and quality for a small speaker . it 's a keeper for me . 
plastic 
about 14 0z . ; tth top is the full diameter ( 3-1 2 '' ) so would fit most infusers i 've seen 
not like a thermos , since it is plastic . but it is crystal clear and cold for that first cup of coffee on the drive to work . 
it does have two holes in the lid . a sip hole and a vent hole . it is not meant to be turned upside down . most hot beverage holders will have some way to vent the steam , unless you get a thermos type container . i hope this helps . it is a handsome mug , nevertheless . thanks 
very easy the lid just slides off , and wash regularly . not intended for dishwasher . 
had no problems with it in the microwave ... works as advertised ... 
if knocked over it will leak out of the 'sip ' hole . there is no cover for this opening . it is not meant to be knocked over , but rather kept upright , like a take-out cup one would get at a major cafe chain . i hope this helps . it is however , a handsome , heavy travel mug that fits most comfortably in the hand . 
the lid does not screw on but you press it onto the top of the `` glass '' and it stays there . it is as secure as you could possibly want or ask for . the question that should be asked is `` if i have long delicate finger-nails am i going to have difficulty prying the top off ? '' my answer : yeah , you just might ... 
i do not know where it is manufactured . i believe it is machine washable , but i would suggest dry cleaning once a year and buy a comforter cover . 
i have a twin & no loops 
it lays on top so its not like when you have your head laying into a down pillow..but its not like a down blanket that i have which is lightweight for the summer ... i live in a cooler summer climate and nights can still be in the 50's.. ; but when i have this blanket for my trailer it has a lightweight feel with a comforter warmth and it does fill in the gap around you so there is a snuggle fit to it ... hope that helps somewhat explains it ... i would find it hard to believe that anyone wouldnt like this comforter ... i doesnt have the prickly part of the feather ..its the soft down . it is well made and there was no cheap quality about it ... . i own quite a few down comforters for all our beds and trailer ... and this was the best of them all ... from now on i will only go with this company as long as the quality remains the same ... 
it is extra long 
it is indeed extra long . 
it fit perfectly , i 'm totally loving it . 
better smaller 
inside the comforter it is promised to be down.the cover itself is 100 % cotton.i saw little piece of down went outside .it is down comforter . 
do n't have a duvet . did n't even know what it was until i asked my wife & # 128563 ; 
yes , fits perfectly into my land of nod twin duvet . it 's definitely heavy weight . i love it because it stays on my 4 year old all night ! i would only use it for winter time - we do n't use our heater at night - we are in california but it gets down to 58 in our house sometimes . this is perfect for us for the winter ! 
the density is approximately 4.5 lbs 
no . even compressed it would be far too bulky to fit in a suitcase . 
i do n't know the exact measurements , i 'm sorry . but i have a queen size mattress and it fits perfectly on top of it . 
i 've only used it on top of another mattress , but it was dense enough that you hardly moved once you were asleep . very comfortable . have to let it air out a bit as it had a noticeable smell , but that eventually goes away : - ) 
its not firm ... its kind of in between soft and firm . 
it most definitely conforms . i 'm a heavier person , but even my kids sunk down in it a bit . it feels great , and yes , it does almost feel like you 're in a comfortable supported position when lying down . i just noticed after a few nights that my hip and back felt worse ... .almost like when i attempted to roll over onto my stomach or side as i always sleep , is when i ran into issues . 
on solid piece of memory foam 4 '' thick . it is vacuum packed so has to be allowed to expand over 24 hours . 
i would have to say that its super soft.but once you lay on it you will sink in and it will cradle your whole body . 
not sure if it 's in fact 'gel ' , but it is very comfortable as long as it 's on a semi firm surface or the other mattress is not to mushy . 
i ordered these sheets : # 1 bed sheet set on amazon - super silky soft - sale - highest ... sold by : mellanni i hope this helps . 
the sizes for this topper follow standard bed sizes minus 1 inch on each side of the length and width to ensure your sheets fit over the topper and your mattress . here are the approximate dimensions for each size : twin - 37 '' x 73 '' x 4 '' twin xl - 37 '' x 78 '' x 4 '' full - 52 '' x 73 '' x 4 '' queen- 58 '' x 78 '' x 4 '' king- 74 '' x 78 '' x 4 '' cal king - 70 '' x 82 '' x 4 '' 
i used one on a hide a bed in place of the original mattress . i hope to find a zippered cover but it sleeps very well even with a 300 lb adult . you can not feel the bars under you at all . 
is a 4 pound density best foam l ever had ... ... ... . and amazon is the best ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
no . the twin sizen is small for the king size bed . and yes the memory foam stays in its place with the fitted sheet . it does not move . 
i do n't know the exact detentions but it was pretty small for the king size topper i bought . i would say it was 1 ft wide x 4ft long rectangle . 
it is all one piece of memory foam . my guests love it . 
it does not have a cover . i bought the 4 inch lucid for a twin size bed and it is 4 inches thick . i guess u can cut it with some big scissors or a sharp blade . hope 
its probably your box spring that is creaky . i do n't think a mattress topper will improve the sound 
this does not fold , it 's too thick . it does roll up , however , and you can put it in the same box it came out of . you would need two people . hope this helps . 
no it does not come with a topper . 
for me it was perfect . not too soft or too firm ; i like a little firmness because i have trouble with my right hip . if the bed is too soft it causes my hip and lower back to ache because there is n't enough support . my husband and i really like this pad a lot . hope this is helpful . 
i stay hot at night the feather bed burnt me up . we purchased this memory foam and it is a lot cooler than feather bed . it 's very comfortable no heat retention . 
yes it does . you should n't disturb you husband with this topper 
no my wife had to get different sheets 
do n't think so . it bottoms out on a mattress when you use your elbow to turn over . 
unfortunately , i do n't remember the dimensions very well . but , i can tell you that the package size can be shipped on international flights . 
i have no idea where the topper was manufactured . 
there is no cover , just the foam . 
the blue light at the base of the unit will change color and let you know when your filter must be replaced . how long a filter will last depends on the amount of minerals etc . in your water . 
amazon unit consists of dock , filter , and pitcher in white , for $ 129.99 . i purchased my aquasonic unit elsewhere because they offered color black as well as dock , filter , pitcher , and dispenser for $ 149.95 . this was a savings of $ 10.03 as the pitcher and dispenser cost $ 29.99 each if purchased separately . shipping was free . hope this answers your question . 
it claims to take some out , which is better than none ( see most others ) , but this brand was a great source of disappointment for me . i returned it 3 different times because eventually it would leak out from the bottom . because of the fluoride filtering , i kept giving it another chance . the customer service was very nice and they kept replacing it . after my 4th filter ( which lasted the longest ) started the slow and eventual heavy leaking , i gave up . which i had better news . still searching . 
base is 4.5 '' wide , 15 '' deep and 12 '' tall . add another inch in depth with pitcher . pitcher handle extends past front of base . 
changing the filter was easy . no major reassembly . i am talking about the pitcher model here , not the sink contraption . 
i looked all over as that is what i would really rather have also . i could n't find anything saying that it did . 
no , it 's plastic . 
our water is very hard the normal cubes that come from our ice maker are white . the small amount that we make with this water have a white hue but are translucent . 
no idea ! go to the aquasana website and see if you can find the information there . if not , give them a call , they 'd be happy to answer any questions you may have . 
i do n't know . i have already returned it to costco . i had other issues with it and will update my review . 
it looks like the pillow case is folded in half in the picture.i think it is for one case . it would say cases meaning two but by the spelling its one case ... its been awhile since i bought mine but this is about right in price ... ..i really do like the case and its worth the money because it protects the pillow..at one time i did not use the case and had to wash pillow that was not a good thing ... . 
no idea . the actual pillowcase does not list a thread count . when it arrives the packaging has the number 100 on it . it 's all very vague 
no it does not . i prefer it this way though because zippers tend to break easily . if you flip the cover inside out and cover the pillow that way , it is a lot easier to get it inside the case . 
sorry , i do n't know . this is a very long pillow case and i had to cut off the excess and the label would have been on that part . 
the pillow cases are not a real bright white , but to me they look more white than ivory ! 
this pillowcase is 21 '' x60 '' . most body pillows are 21 '' x54 '' so the pillowcase fits perfectly . if your pillow is , in fact , 60 '' long , the pillow may come right to the end of the pillowcase . customers have told me they buy two pillowcases and put one on and then put the second one on the opposite way . this might work well for you as well . 
the pillowcase is 60 '' long . 
i ca n't honestly say for sure . i no longer have the packaging it arrived in . the tag inside says 100 % egyptian cotton and the company name is : american pillowcase . 
they are about 4.25 inches high by about 2.75 inches across the middle of the top and 2 inches across the middle of the bottom . they hold 10 oz to the top of the cup . 
i do n't think so . i bought these and they are a thicker plastic . i always have to wash them on the top rack of the dishwasher . i washed one on the bottom and it melted the bottom . for this reason , i do n't think they have melamine because i do n't think it would have melted after one wash if it had . they are very sturdy cups . i 've washed them a ton in the dishwasher and there is no fading . i love them and highly recommend them ! 
there is no code 
no they will not . they are great cups 
as long as they are on the top rack , we have never had a problem with the cups flipping . 
yes , bpa free ! ! we 've been using them a month and they still look new.. really great cups ! 
hello leigh , i am sorry we only offer this as a multi color set right now . us acrylic , llc 
they are hard plastic . 
i assume so , but like any plastic cup it will feel hot to the touch - the plastic is n't super thick - i would n't microwave them to warm them up though .

hi , this item is a set of 8 jugs . thank you , lily 's home customer service 
hi , this item does not come with lids . thank you , lily 's home customer service 
does n't come with lids , but they would take regular size lids . 
16 ounces 
they are about 5 inches tall , 3 inches wide ( without handle ) , and hold about 16 ounces of liquid . the 5 inches includes the top rim . 
i 'm not sure but it 's the size of your average mason jar . 
i do n't know but it looks strong . 
16oz . 
i think they were made in china ... package in ny ... very nice glasses tho , thick and they have some weight to them . i really like mine ... i do n't regret buying them ! 
hi , approximately 10 tablespoons of loose leaf tea are a good measure for brewing a gallon of tea . currently , this is the only size tea infuser we offer . since our infuser holds about 1 1 2 tablespoons , depending on which tea variety you use , it would take you about 6-7 filling brewing times with our infuser to make a gallon . hope this is helpful , especially for making iced tea as summer approaches ! warmly , bridgett from flourish & thrive 
the holes are small , you can get a straight pin through them.if your tea is fine like that in a tea bag it will not work . 
yes..the finer ones will leak through a bit . this does n't bother me too much because i tend to use a larger cut leaf . 
hi megan , the materials are made in china and we assemble and pack them here in nc , usa . thanks , bridgett 
it comes with a stand that the infuser is placed on after the tea is finished steeping . on the image , the stand is the little green thing on the bottom . 
this is just a bit under 6 '' long . 
the infuser measures about 6 inches tall . 
hi karen , yes , the silicone is bpa-free . we will likely be adding this information to our packaging in the future . thanks , bridgett from flourish & thrive 
definitely not . 
hello ! you could fit some diced ginger in the tea infuser and use it the way they suggest . i 'm fairly certain stainless steel and silicone can withstand heat just fine , but maybe you can find a better product for what you 're looking to do . something meant to be completely submerged . hope this helped ! 
hello ! it depend on where you living , it usually takes about 7-15 working days to us , uk , ca and au .

yes - you use but it needs be done very carefully and slowly and on an angle ( i am presuming that your edge id on one side of the knife ) . i would use it only a few times - less that you would for a normal knife . i only other way to do a serrated edge knife is to buy the right size round fine file and do each grove 1 by 1 - it takes a lot of time and skill to the right angle for every groove . most home cooks would get it wrong and end up with an uneven blade . hope that helps . 
there are two fixed angles -- one at the top for sharpening knives , the other lower for sharpening scissors and other implements . it takes a screwdriver and some fuss to change from one to the other , which is why i suggested a person should own two units -- one for each type of sharpening without the bother of switching back and forth between them . 
not electric ... works well though . suction clamp to counter and just slide knife through sharpener on top . we like ours . 
3-4 pulls through the sharpener , just as advertised . hands down the best sharpener i 've ever used . 
i do n't know . i examined the sharpener , but saw no indication of where it was made . perhaps someone with the original packaging might be able to tell . 
i have used it on my sewing scissors , nursing scissors , but do not have the cat claw clippers , so do not know . i do know this is best sharpener i have used and my knives have stayed sharper longer . hope this helps 
i do n't believe so . i could barely sharpen my scissors with it .

i was able to sharpen mine . love this item . 
do n't know , but all i can say is that it is the best thing i have ever used on my knives . got sick of having to wait for hubby to sharpen them , now i can do it in a flash . 
yes . there are many types of beverages available for it . 
the machine is 14 inches tall . it fits nicely under my cabinets . 
the filter helps take out any hard water minerals and helps prevent scale froming . 
we have frequent power outages and programming is not lost . 
yes it does . a 24 pk variety pack of kcups . everything you need to start when you open the box . 
black with grey trim 
i do n't have this model myself ; i have a different model , but have you tried unplugging it and resetting it ? sometimes they just get a `` little hiccup '' . 
yup very well too 
yes , as long as it is cleaned right after use . the operative words are 'right after ' . : ) 
yes it does juice kale ... kale drinks are my absolute favorite ! ! ! 
no , it is a centrifugal juicer , but i love it . i use kale and spinach weekly in this juicer and have had it almost a year 
one finger at 9 o'clock and one at three o'clock and apply a little lift . 
you put the dogs in first , after 3 minutes , put the buns in to steam for another 3 minutes . the hot dogs take 6 minutes total to cook . i 've had no problems leaving the dogs and buns in the steamer , and taking them out when someone wanted one . i do turn off the heat and leave the lid on to keep the heat in . the buns stay soft , and the dogs stay warm . 
yes ! absolutely ! i use steemeewonder on my portable induction burner . it will boil the water super fast in max 60 seconds ! thank you for the question and your interest . jerry coogan inventor 
hello emma , thank you for the question and your interest . the top `` perfect bun steamer '' tier does have only 4 holes that are strategically located so that the excess steam that converts to condensation ( see above main photo ) from the concave glass lid ( not flat red plastic ) drops back into the water ( not on top of the buns ) . also , because of this design you do n't have to worry about the water evaporating as much because the water that turns to steam is recirculated . jerry coogan inventor 
clare r. - not electric . i mainly use it on the stove-top , which i love . because its not electric , it 's kind of become a `` go-to '' camping piece , and my hubby likes using it when he 's cooking for the bbq & pool days . he 'll stick it right on one of those grill side warmer burners and that seems to work out really well for him . hope this helps ! 
the bottom pot holds 4 quarts but you only need ( half ) 2 quarts of water for perfect steaming of hotdogs in 6 minutes and buns in 3 minutes ! jerry coogan inventor 
no , you do n't need to plug it in . you place it on a heat source like your stove top , either gas or electric , or you can even place it on a bbq grill and use the heat source . that way you can get the water to boil and thus create steam . 
sure there are holes in the top & middle pots . the important thing is that the middle level has a lot of holes to steam all the hotdogs evenly and quickly , while the top level has only a few holes to steam buns on top . this also means you can boil corn or potatoes on the bottom level , while you steam cook veggies or shrimp or hot dogs on the middle level , & steam buns on top . 
hello marie : i have converted $ 50 usd to indian rupees = 3037.45 indian rupees + freight cost you can keep warm or reheat nan bread in the top level . if you are interested , i can contact amazon to ask them how to process your credit card transaction including freight cost to india . thank you for your interest jerry coogan inventor 
it does n't have it 's own heat source . use it on a stove top . 
thanks for your question . i would like to mention that my product is the only '' 12 hotdogs in 6 minutes '' stainless steel ( non-plastic ) hotdog steamer on amazon for the consumer today . i include expedited shipping . the product is shipped from montreal quebec canada . also , amazon prime costs $ 99 per year 
it was the second highest rated in consumer reports . i really like it . light weight but heavy duty when vacuuming the carpet and bare floors . 
i recently purchased one of these and i have 2 dogs , hardwood floors , rustic travertine tile , and carpet . it works fantastic for me . i used to have 3 separate cleaning tools , none of which did a good job . i was hesitant like you because i have never had a vacuum like this ( only up rights ) . i can honestly say i will never go back to the upright . the wood floor is cleaner with this than when i sweep with a broom . it also is powerful enough to get dirt from the grout filled tile . the other amazing thing about this model is the pet upholstery attachment . i let my dogs up on the sofa and this attachment easily removes all the dog hair . i am one happy camper . 
the power head has 4 different height levels from hardwood to carpet , it does come with a small brush head which attaches to the main handle , separate from the power head 
yes a button reels it into the machine - works great ! by the way i love everything about this machine 
it should . the vacuum head is low profile and the wand extends . 
i believe the round filter need not be replaced , it is intended to rinse out with warm water and air dry . there should be parts shown in the manual , however 
the floor tool needs to be lowered to the lowest level . make sure it has auction to the wand . sometimes the canister becomes unmatched and not seated properly 
no . nothing 
sorry brenda , not able to find where it 's made . not listed on the vacuum or in the accompanying paperwork . ( think if it was made in the usa , it would be proudly stated somewhere ) just says , `` manufactured for sears brands management corp . 1-800-4my-home . '' i can say that i was a tough sell when buying vacuums because i want something what works well on all levels of my home and is n't a `` toy '' . this vacuum has incredible suction both through the power head and the attachments . no matter how clean my house appears before i begin , i always have a remarkable amount of dust and hair in the dust canister when i 'm finished . the cord length is great and it 's relatively light for carrying up the stairs . i keep the attachments in a small tote bag because the clips that they provide to keep them on the handle just seem awkward and get bumped when vacuuming under the beds or in tight areas . ( my previous canister had a storage compartment but this bagless style does n't have one ) . 
the temperature range is from -58 f to 572 f . 
no 
i do n't know , but i ca n't see why not . the probe is made of steel . 
no it is n't . 
yes 
no , you 're not supposed to get the electronic head wet at all . 
have one , but have no idea on the warranty 
no 
it depends on how far the temperature is from where you begin , but i think it 's pretty quick 
yes the filters fit this model . i just bought the replacement filters on amazon . mr coffee makes the holder or what ever you call it that fits above the basket it is mr coffee wf10 this i bought at my local publix grocery store here in fl but it only comes with one filter . you are supposed to use one every month which is what i do and the coffee is much better i ca n't find the replacement filters except online . 
yes 
i use on a bvmc-pstx91thermal unit . perfect replacement . 
it 's a tiny , tiny bit smaller diameter than the filter that comes with the coffee maker but it will still fit just fine . 
here is the difference . if , a big 'if ' your coffee maker takes a paper filter that is round and has a flat bottom , it should work . if your coffee make uses a paper filter that comes to a point at the bottom they probably wo n't fit . round filters are sold in the stores in a see-through package and stacked one on top of the other , the pointed filters are usually in a box . unfortunately , you should have read the reviews on the coffee maker you have - just google in tjx37 and you 'll find a lot of unhappy customers for that particular model . if these round filters work for you each one will last one month , so the package you display with your question ( which is what i purchased ) will last a complete year . one critical thing ! inside your coffee maker there should be a 'filter holder ' , and it should have had one filter of this kind in side that frame , if not , it is not designed to be used with these kinds of filters . it is a little plastic frame that these filters fit inside of , then that fits inside the round opening that holds the round paper filter for the coffee - i hope that explanation is clear ? good luck . 
these are 3-3 8 '' . 
calcium deposits have build up on most coffee makers i have owned . i just use a tooth brush around the areas i can see and reach with hot water.the filters edges sit along the filter baskets housing . i bought a golden filter basket here on amazon together with these pods . the pods sit in the center of the basket above . the boiled water shoots on the pod . the water accumulates along the filter area and gets soaked into the filter and eventually drips into the filter basket with coffee . i like the set up in my coffee maker . you get plenty of filters for what you pay for . 
i do n't know if that model needs one or not . if it does , there will be at least one in the package when you receive it . the filter is good for about three months on average so you 'll have time to order more . 
yes they will fit . no problem . 
these are water filters with charcoal . they are not coffee filters . you have to get a round holder , to put them in . they make the water taste better , like a brita filter . mine came with the mr. coffee . i use any paper filters in the gold screen permanent filter , also . 
6'2 '' long 3'8 '' wide 
it only came with one and yes its a great product . a little uncomfortable to sleep on for a nightly basis . but is a great piece though . 
yes , but the cushions and the legs are stored inside the body . 
it does and it gets unbalance some how when you move to one side it feels like it tips over 
it is packed in one piece box isthe width of half the couch 
it could be bettery 
no , they fit perfect 
it 's `` hard '' but not as hard as a shoe - more like a sheet of plastic hard enough to cover the sole of a shoe , but you would want a shoe inside this . it is not a boot , it is a covering for shoes . ( even sandals could go inside , but you need more of a sole than this provides . ) 
i really doubt it . only for emergency 
definitely will be too small . they would probably only fit up to a 10 comfortably . 
i wear a 7 and they are too big for me maybe too small for a 9 .but i just wear a sling shoe inside . hope this helps . 
i would still get large ... i wear 8 1 2 and large was snug but fit . i guess you could try medium , but i did n't order any medium so i do n't know how they fit . 
the soles are not slippery , yes they have traction , i work outside , and i really appreciate having such a nice boot that is not heavy on the feet , comfortable and slips easily over my workshoes , i purchased the large size and maybe could have gone with medium , i take a size 8 1 2 women 's work shoe , i have worn them in storms and working in the yard several times , and thank the dots for the boots further the price is right ... ... 
i took these to ireland with me but did not need . i tried them them on at home they fit over my shoes which are a womens size 8 . 
hey there , lynne . unfortunately , they do not come in sizes . i 'm a size 8 and have n't had any problems . 
yes , they are reusable . i do n't know how they 'd hold up for long term heavy usage but with care they should last quite awhile . 
the product is designed in the us and made in china . 
i have not had a problem with marks made by pan movement on the surface . i recommend cleaning the cooktop with cleaners made for glass top stoves . i am very pleased with this product . i use it daily . 
i use one of these on both my table and counter top . the bottom of the unit does not get hot or even warm . you just need to be careful not to block the cooling fan or air vents on this cooker . it works best if set-up on any hard smooth level surface that is non-metallic , like wood stone or tile . 
it is designed to be used on the counter-top only . 
on the low setting mine draws about 7amps @ 120 volt which calculates to 840 watt 's .

i do n't think so , prestiage pressure cookers are made of aluminum . you could give it a magnet test , some aluminum cookware have iron plates formed in the bottoms . 
really , how do you expect the device to `` know '' you forgot about what you were doing with it ? 
i ma satisfied 
it is the smaller circle that heard up . on my unit it is 5 inches from side to side . we current use a 12 '' skillet with a 9 '' base with no problems . 
the range is 150 to 450 f . 
thank you for your interest in our gw22604 . i am not sure what the max burton 6000 is but our unit is manufactured for us in china . 
good afternoon heather , the gowise usa gw22604 kitchen electric induction glass smooth top cooktop has increments of 30 degrees fahrenheit . if you have any other questions or concerns , please feel free to contact us , thank you ! -gowise usa 
when a pan is removed the unit turns off instantly and will beep about 4 times , for maybe 6 or 8 seconds total . if the pan is returned during this time cooking continues . if the pan does n't return , the unit turns itself off and would have to be reset . 
the temperature range is measured in f . 
this cooktop works with 18 0 stainless steel and iron and must have a base that is at least 4.7 '' wide and flat only .

glass ... small juice glasses 
painted stained . hand wash. i love mine ! 
yes , they 're fine in the dishwasher . we use them daily ; great small juice glasses . 
yes though they do n't go all the way down so the stack will get tall fairly quickly . 
23.6 ( w ) x 15.0 ( h ) x 21.7 ( d ) 
i believe they represent energy saver , cool , fan and dry . the droplet represents the dry function . 
it 's about 6 feet . 
it is hard . lift and pull out from the left side bottom of the panel , not the main frame of the unit ( the very bottom ) . when closing it tuck in the left side top of the panel and snap in the bottom . not the best design . 
110 volt 15 or 20 amp circuit ( parallel plug ) which is a normal plug . 
window unit i believe ... 
yes ... i think most do these days 
the case that is used for window installation is required for wall installation . i had to find the manual , since i installed it in a window . i would think you would find it easier to install the case in the wall , then slide the a c in , than it would be installing this fairly heavy unit in tact . the use & installation manual can be found at http : www.friedrich.com sites default files chill_io_manual_cp10_cp12_2014_english_0.pdf -- manual page # 16 ( pdf file pg 17 ) 
yes it does . works great 
yes . 
very easy 
only the first filter is permanent and is easily cleaned , but as i have not had to replace the interior filters i have no idea what they cost . 
we have recently started to use our ap260 , but i seem to remember reading something about the light blinking if the filter needs to be cleaned or replaced . 
yes 
try unplugging the unit to reset it 
yes 
yes 
we have two of the units and find that the filters can not be cleaned and reused ; instead , they must be replaced . it would be nice if re-usable cleanable replacement filters were available . 
no , i only here the noise of the fan . 
yes , the plasma generator can be turned off . i have six units throughout the house and can not sense a difference with it on or off as far as having a physical response . i leave it on all the time because of how well the ions remove smoke . keep in mind , that it does n't generate ozone .

i do n't know the warranty period but had a problem with minor shipping damage , which should have been able to be repaired under warranty . the company said it would be covered and referred me to a local supplier who handles their warranty work , but the local vendor refused because we did not buy it from them . we had to return the unit to amazon and bought another unit locally . 
i would n't recommend it . this a c has sleeves that are specially fitted to go into the metal frame ( and screwed in ) 
i did not need to use the support bracket in a double hung window . so just install from inside , outer case first then compressor slides right in . great machine , quiet and efficient . 
yes , i am able to draw in outside air but i can not exhaust it , 
mine came with the wall sleeve as i believe they all do . it has been a year but i am almost certain they come as a standard . you might give them a call . they are a usa manufacturing company . i called for a couple installation and electrical installation concerns before purchasing and they were very helpful ... and this is one very nice unit ! 
yes , prongs are standard and fit into a standard 3 prong wall socket but the body surrounding the plug is a 2 x 3 inch 90 degree plug . you would use the lower wall socket to plug the ac into and then a standard ( for instance lamp cord plug ) into the upper wall socket . the reason the ac unit plug is large is because it contains a safety shut-off mechanism in the body to protect unit from electrical overloads that could create shorts fires . check the specs because the electrical socket must be 15 amps . this is pretty standard . it is a nice unit . we really enjoy ours.. 
yes , no indicator for it on the remote control screen though . 
no it does not 
not really . look for models that are specifically designed for such windows . frigidaire make a few . frak series 
12.5 amps or less . depends on the setting . the quality on this unit is atypical of friedrich units . this one 's made in china . poor quality compared to the usa made units . i would not buy it again . too expensive to send back or have serviced . 
the unit has a cool , dry and fan modes . it functions as an ac . 
very quiet unit ... i love it . 
this is 115 volta 
overall width : 26 '' overall depth with front : 26 7 8 '' overall height : 16 7 8 '' 
yes , it does . very convenient . 
the unit comes with everything that is needed for a window installation . some installers may be leery about installing a large ac thru the wall without wall brackets , but i installed the unit as per friedrich ' instructions without any issues . i used 2 inch wood screws for my installation . there 's no way the unit would ever fall out unless the entire wall collapsed . 
noise is relative thing . my first unit was noisier than i would tolerate and i sent it back . the 2nd unit was considerably better , not as quiet as some reviews would leave you thinking . your mileage may vary . 
it is very quiet , the quietest ac i have heard . 
530 watt 
this unit comes with its own casing and must be used with its own casing . do not attempt to place it into a another sleeve : in-wall finished hole width : 18 7 8 '' in-wall finished hole depth : 7 1 2 '' max . in-wall finished hole height : 14 1 8 '' 
it should be ok 
yes . i installed it through the wall . 
you are not able to close the vents completely . 
yes it does . 
assuming you will not use the shutters as an outside surface to attach the ac unit to , you will butt the unit to the actual wall itself , and if you have a standard wall thickness the unit will protrude into the room area about seven and a half inches . 
yes , it is a firm limit . if the wall is thicker than that , it will block the side vents and the unit will malfunction . 
the tag on the comforter says everything is 100 % polyester . 
i washed the shams on delicate and dried them on low . they washed great . ( still look new ) i have n't washed the comforter yet . i feel like it would wash ok also but its so large i will probably take it to the laundry mat when the time comes . : ) 
it is the same color as the comforter gray . 
we do not offer the comforter individually . thank you 
the picture shown for this product is almost exactly how my king comforter looks on my queen sized bed . yes , mine hangs off the edges a little more , but that is how i like it . if you are actually getting it to fit a king , i would personally try to find the california king ( oversized king ) set in this product . this goes for all comforters . but , if you do n't pull the comforter up all the way to the top of the bed , it should be `` alright '' at the end . i would definetly use the bedskirt also . 
from your descriptions , it would be closest to silver taupe-gray color . 
it is a little darker in person . 
yes , i have a king bed . it does n't hang off the bedside very far ( like the picture shows ) . personally i love huge oversized bedspreads-this is just fit to size . the material is cheap so be careful when you wash it . the material shrinks up a little ... . 
it 's not satin or cotton to me , not shiny but more sateen . very soft and flowy . i love my set , it looks and feels great . sorry i could n't be more exact but it 's hard to describe . 
i got the pretty champagne color , love it 
full 
yes , t is actually prettier than the picture ! 
i have n't ' wash it yet . i not impressed by item . up to individual if they would order , everyone is different . 
i am 5 ' 3 '' and do n't have ant problems and do n't need any help putting it on and off . this vacuum is a lot lighter than the 10 quart . my husband has the 10 quart also and he finds this one is a lot easier to use and lighter . good luck ! 
1.5 '' 
yes , it is . it is very well designed and the use of hepa in the title would suggest that they will be libel of false advertising if it is not the case . go to the manufacturers web-site : http : www.pro-team.com vacuums ? style=1 & id=106576 
unfortunately it will not . the extension cord that comes with it is a very heavy duty line . i would recommend buying an american-european cord convert on amazon . that should do the trick . you could also contact a sales rep from pro team but they do not have any conversion kits on their site . 
it only sucks doent blow 
nancy the bags are disposable but i am sure you can empty them a few times . you need to make sure you use real proteam bags to protect dirt and dust from damaging the motor . mike kline - home delivered 
the backpack harness comes with the vacuum . the harness has 3 loops which can be used as attachment holders . 
hello , thanks for your question . according to the information in the product description section of the product page , the package includes the following attachments : 14 '' xover multi-surface floor tool , 17 '' crevice tool , 3 '' dust brush , 5 '' upholstery tool . 1 '' static-dissipating vacuum hose , 1.5 '' telescoping wand , 50 ' extension cord and two intercept micro filter bags . have a great day ! 
the super quatervac has a 6-quart capacity and the super coachvac has a 10-quart capacity . comparison information is available on the proteam website : http : www.pro-team.com images documents ss_scv_sqv % 20hepa_oct12.pdf 
i have no doubt it will . i have cut-pile frieze type carpet in my home . i use a top-of-the line kenmore upright for spot vacuuming and the backpack unit for a whole house vacuum job . the upright has a revolving brush and the proteam does not ; however , the proteam does just as well as the upright but quicker . 
plastic , and yes , it will scratch hardwood floors . you will need to get the horse hair brush attachment . it works incredible . 
there is no beater brush included . if you keep the filters clean it works pretty well on thick carpets since it does have alot of suction . some vac places online sell the wand and beater brush kit if you need one . i have n't needed a beater brush yet . 
the motor is 9.9amp , which at 110v would be 1100w , and we do not sell a fabric bag . 
product dimensions : 33 x 14 x 14 inches ; 10 pounds is the super vac product dimensions : 33 x 14 x 14 inches ; 11 pounds proteam vac so yes is the answer 
works great under pews 
yes , with hard for attachments . 
i am not sure u think it has a 5 year warranty . i will say we use ours everyday at work , and i am about to order one for my home . 
yes it is 
not quite sure of the exact length ( maybe 7 feet ? ) , but the wand is quite long and has a downward curve toward the floor ( i.e. , it 's not a straight wand as on consumer vacuums ) . the length is not adjustable . tall people will have absolutely no issues with the wand length . for shorter people , it may feel a little awkward , but the performance of the vacuum , which is amazing , makes up for it . on edit : the wand is actually about 5 or so feet in vertical height and probably around 6 feet or so in total length , including the curve . 
yes , you can watch tv and hear it if you have the volume up somewhat - i vacuum while listening via ear buds to audio books ... better than listening to my wife yell : `` you missed a spot '' ! 
the top center of the lid is plastic to allow you to push to close without burning yourself . therefore the inside circle part if the lid is also plastic . the rest of the lid is stainless steel inside and outside and so is the entire container . 
the box shown on amazon says 1500w 
no , 110 is what this uses . 
china great looking very poor quality buy a breville cost more but oh my is great my mother use to say you get what you pay for good luck 
as soon as the water reaches a rolling boil , the unit shuts off and stops heating , so one could say that the water begins to cool at that very point . it is not a thermal carafe , so the water will eventually cool off . however , it literally takes only seconds for the water to reach a boil again if the user switches it back on . we 've been quite pleased with this unit and actually wish we 'd bought it or one like it sooner . 
no 
no it does n't 
yes , the plastic water level window . 
there isnofilter on the electric tea kettle 
we are not sure , check the manufacturers website or contact them directly for the country of origin . 
yes . the menu selection comes with glutin rice , mixed rice , sushi rice , gaba rice , black bean , nu-rung-gi , nutri rice , porridge , multi cook , ferment bread baking , and auto clean . 
it does not have a stone insert . the interior is made of a non-stick , heavy duty material . 
uncooked 
cooked 
i just use the default option which takes 34 minutes . hope this helps . 
this does n't have batteries , just power cord . 
yes , the product comes with an english manual as well as korean and chinese . 
yes it is 
yes this is made for use in usa . thanks 
no it has 2 receivers but only one button if you need front and back door you would need to buy two of them 
no warranty info came with the product . 
this is programmed for the remotes it comes with . i do not know if you can add to the unit , but it works great as it is . 
yes 
yes 
not sure why you 'd want to , but no . you 'd have to unplug the ringers from the wall . 
the two units that plug in are inside the house and the unit that is outside is on the house under a porch roof so i think it will be fine . it has been installed for about a month now and we have had rain , so i think it will be fine . it is a lot better than the total battery operated ones . 
we bought 2 different sets and they do not crossover , but work great . 
38 , thank you . 
yes , it is made for us plug in with flat plug , rated for 110v . thank you . 
yes 
the fondue pot has a heating element so it will melt the chocolate for you . 
yes . perfectly

i 'm not sure exactly why the big price difference . i purchased the more expensive oster product for much less than what it 's selling for now and i still absolutely love it . when i read some of the details regarding the products , the one selling for $ 29.99 did not specify if it came with forks , but the one i bought did . it could also be because it was silver and not some fancy color . sometimes a color of an item can cause a difference in pricing . hope this helps . 
it is a plug in and it is actually magnetic for safety purposes ! i absolutely loved it and used it as a party with several children around . 
no , this is electric 
it 's electric . 
no 
hi , i think it also depends on if you just have it on for humidity or if you have it on as diffuser . i have never had it 10 12 hours or if i did , very rarely . i had a regular diffuser that i bought not from amazon and that one truly lasts . its called the premium whisper diffuser off abundanthealth . this one is ok , but is n't exactly how i would have wanted it to work . takes more ti fill and clean where as the other one i had was quite a sinch . anyway , sometimes the wate lasts a bit longer than 3 hours , but rarely the 10 12 hours . maybe i am doing something wrong on my end . hope i helped some . 
it could , but i use distilled water so i do n't have the white build up . i clean it about once a month and i use it almost daily . 
yes i do all the time 
i use for my entire 2nd floor of our house . which is about 900 sq ft. 9 ft ceilings . i could probably use two for each floor but 1 does pretty well . i bought these for healing purposes as well as room deodorizes . i got sick of wasting money on glade plugins . plus those chemicals freak me out . these work really well . love 'em . 
yup ! gives two little beeps to let you know it 's out , then shuts off . 
china 
it 's plastic . you can pick a single color or let it cycle through all of them . 
you can not dim it , but you can turn the light on or leave it off . 
i love my nascco - it does what i expected and is more then i expected as well . it is a cube about 7 '' w x 7 '' d and is about 5 '' h. filled it runes for about 12 hours . i hope this is helpful . 
the colors are very similar to the picture : dark brown , brown , old rose , dark wine , white , black , small gold details . very nice ! 
the screws and holder were easy to attach to the middle of each frame . we used pencil to mark off the top of each picture and used our own nails in the wall . the different sections are light to hang . 
had the same issue..i just used a little thicker small nail..place the higher middle piece 1st , then kine up the other middle piece and move along ... i did it with my husband so it was a little easier . 
no 
no , it comes with the hardware in a bag , you have to attach it all yourself . 
i do n't know what the symbols mean. , but i like the flowers and the pot . 
yes it is . its not like a flat paper print , it was like a painting with a rough surface . 
the size is appx 6.5 '' wide by 9 '' and it 's about a half inch thick , very slim . i believe the default is ounces pounds but it has several `` modes '' and it can easily be set to grams or ounces , etc . it 's the easiest kitchen scale i have ever used . i really like the `` tare weight '' function ; you put your dish on the scale and touch the area that said `` tare '' and the scale zero 's out . then any food item ( s ) you put into your dish is weighed , just the food . i love this feature and it 's super easy . the scale operates on two small batteries and it turns itself off after a minute if not in use . it does n't take up much room and i did n't have to read a ton of instructions to use the darn thing . love it ! 
there is plenty of room for your food without touching the digital buttons . you can also put a bowl or plate on it - it will weigh that item first and then subtract it from the food weight - i love this scale - glad i purchased it . 
yes , if you tare the weight with something on the scale and then take it off , it will tell you the negative weight . ( negative weight meaning what the object on the scale weighted , before taring the scale back to 0 . ) 
on the underside there is a small removable cover , similar to radios and remote controls , remove the cover and replace the batteries . simple and quick . when you use the scale , if you do n't turn it off it will automatically turn itself off in about a minute so it does n't run down the batteries . i had mine almost a year before i had to replace the batteries and i was using it daily . 
the scale auto shuts off after 1 minute of inactivity . 
no . manufacturer states that it is not waterproof . i have spilled wet ingredients in small amounts on the glass top and that is ok. the top surface is easy to clean with a damp cloth and that is also ok per manufacturer . i do n't know what would happen if a cup of water was turned over near it , although it does sit a bit above the counter on tiny rubber pads . 
with a damp rag after normal use . every so often , we use a mild cleaner like windex on it . 
yes it can . 
2 aaa 
i do n't care where it was made . it arrived with corroded batteries . 
yes it is 
16 ounce capacity 
i ca n't tell you exactly , but it fits in my cup holder in the car . i hope that helps . 
it is removable , but do n't think that it can be used in a different cup . 
unfortunately no , it 's not . 
not sure . but i do love the cup . do n't use it all the time and i usually hand wash it . 
i never tried just brewed hot tea , but i did put warm tea in my cup and it was fine . 
shelf opening is 13 1 2 '' from the shelf up to the outside edge trim of the table top . from the floor to the under side of the shelf is 19 '' . the shelf does okay with the mixers i use for distillery promotions , but it is n't heavy duty when you look at the amazon photo of the back side of the bar you can see it 's a thin 3 16 '' piece of what i think is probably masonite and not shown is a partial small brace attached to the center underside of the shelf ... it 's not really sturdy enough to be loaded up with tons of mixer bottles . it was made in china and for the price it was affordable enough that we purchased 3 more for distillery promotions . it 's lightweight and quick set-up , it would be perfect for tailgate parties or to throw up for an outdoor bbq . laura the red cup pong bar is nice , but if you 're looking for something a little more high quality . i also purchased an ez-up table though it does n't come with the lower shelves you can purchase lower shelves for the ez-up table from the company who makes the tables ; it 's definitely heavy duty , but unfortunately considerably more expensive and not as lightweight portable as the red cup pong bar . http : www.amazon.com gp product b002vubbxw ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 
yes it does but it all packs up nicely in its carrying case . 
the shelf does not need to be installed , but the table will be very wobbly without it . you could sit with a stool under the bar , however , the whole table is pretty flimsy . definitely useable , but i would recommend using the shelf , which would inhibit you from putting your legs under the table . 
the frame is made of aluminum . the top is made of what i think is pressboard with some kind of coating on the top & underneath . i use mine all the time for distillery promotion at liquor store tastings and i 'm careful to wipe any spills right so the portable bar has held up well . 
yes it can 
yes , this juicer has rubber piece that squeezes pulp before ejection . 
it seems to do most anything . i would cut things small . for the investment it is a great juicer 
yes ! quite nicely ! it is a masticating juicer , which is the type that can juice wheatgrass . 
do n't think so . great machine though 
it has a 1 year manufacturer warranty . 
very simple ... quick and easy 
i bought it for making fries . the thing you put the food in is about the size of a soda can . and it did not make fries well at all . it does seem like it will work for other things . it looks to be the exact same product as the link posted-and there are 70 mixed reviews that you can check out . http : www.qvc.com qvc.product.k14798.html 
we have sliced several kinds of vegetables and cheese , and it has several `` blades '' for different things . we 've never tried tomatoes , though , but it works well on what we 've tried so far so do n't see why it would n't slice tomatoes if you found the right blade for what you need . that took some trial and error attempts . 
i do n't know , i ran it on 120 volts and i was not happy with it at all . it did not grate cheese well and it had too many parts to clean afterwards . 
i actually did not try it for anything else , when it did not grate the cheese ( which is the main reason i bought it ) i tossed it in the garbage bin . the other problem i had was there were too many parts to clean after use . 
unfortunately it will not slice potatoes thin enough for potato chips , you should consider a different device for that purpose . 
i would say more turquoise then teal . 
i bought a separate bed skirt for the set . it does n't cover all the way past box springs . 
it is just a comforter , 2 pillow shams or cases whatever u call them and one throe pillow ! no sheets at all ! 
it 's not too thick to be overly hot . it hangs pretty low on my queen size bed from side to side but i do n't have it at the top to make it look better at the bottom . so i do n't know how well it would fit a king . 
full size washer or extra large washer .

i no longer have these , but i remember them well . i would say that the seats in the 2nd row need to be 4 feet away for optimal space , however ... since the head part does not recline as low as the foot part on the units behind , you could really get away with 2 feet space between units . 
here are all of the dimensions : seat size : 19 '' w x 21 '' d , back size : 22 '' w x 28 '' h , seat height : 18 '' h , arm height from floor : 25 '' h , arm height from seat : 7 '' h , overall width : 63 '' w , overall depth : 38 - 68 '' d , overall height : 43.5 '' h . please let us know if you need any other information . 
no i do n't think so ... the base is one unit 
yes , the seats are great 
the entire size of the back ... .approx 30 '' to 3 feet 
there is only a 2 seat and 3 seat . the 3 seat item number is bt-70259-3-bk-gg 
yes they do 
i do n't know actual dimensions . it was packaged and delivered on a pallet that would not fit through our doorway . we unpacked the box and chairs our garage . my husband and oldest son brought the two pieces in and carried them into our basement where we assembled them without any issues . 
the recline mechanism can only be locked in the closed ( upright ) position . 
the price is for three seats with two consoles . the upholstery is black bonded leather . these are manual recline chairs ( as compared to power recline ) . there are two consoles that each have two cupholders . the dimensions are : seat size : 19 '' w x 21 '' d , back size : 22 '' w x 28 '' h , seat height : 18 '' h , arm height from floor : 25 '' h , arm height from seat : 7 '' h , overall width : 95 '' w , overall depth : 38 - 68 '' d , overall height : 43.5 '' h , weight capacity : 250 lbs . the price includes curbside delivery . please let us know if you have any other questions . 
around 94 inches 
this is not a wall hugger . i have this away from the wall about 1 1 2 feet to 2 feet away from the wall to allow for full recline while watching movies . 
hello , white glove service can be provided , however it would be a separate fee . we would need your shipping address in order to get a quote from the manufacturer for you . the item would be shipped via freight carrier . if you need anything else , please let us know . thank you . 
it comes in one very large box . we were able to get it into the room with 1 adult , 1 child , and a furniture dolly . 
i believe china 
hi from previous problems the 3 seater can be dissembled and put back together . it might require a professional to do this . casa-candy 
it 's 17 long 9 inches wide and about 8 inches deep plenty of room for remotes 
yes the unit can be dismantled and then put together in the final room . casa-candy 
hi , no . they are all attached in one piece as you see in the picture . 
when fully opened the cart is 22 '' long . the cart itself is 18 '' wide , but the rear wheels are 24 '' end to end . the cart internal measurements are 17 1 2 '' x 14 3 4 '' and it is 24 '' deep . 
plastic . the shopping cart is garbage . you ca n't put anything heavy in it . if you do the wheels will come off . i just use it for laundry now . going to get another shopping cart . do n't buy if your going to put something heavy ini it . you been warned 
maybe 5 lbs not sure ... but very light ! 
i 'm not sure about the capacity but it seems sufficient for any amount of groceries . the cloth part is removable but not the wire mesh . 
i do n't think it will fit in a suitcase even unassembled . book is about 2 ft wide by 4 feet tall by two inches deep ... give or take 
about $ 150 . 
the unit is 11 inches wide , 16 inches high , and 3 1 2 inches deep . 
the screws were about an inch long . too long to use on a cabinet door . i mounted mine on a cabinet door using two 3m hooks on the top rail . stays on even when the cabinet door is opened and closed , although it does sway a bit . 
i measured about 6 and 1 2 inches space from shelf to upper shelf . 
yes , it is almost exactly 3 '' wide . i have 3 '' wide jars in mine ! 
yes . just use the butterfly wings or just use what you get just drill hole smaller so the plastic insert is tight .. mine worked great.. 
approximately 8 '' ( 7 7 8 to be exact ) ... 
those jars are 2 '' x 2 '' x 4.5 '' tall . they do not fit as well in the picture as they have it shown . meaning , the jars are too small for the shelf , so they fit very loose and will tip over . what you ca n't see in the picture is how much space is between the wall and the jar . 
try the `` simply organic '' line of spices http : www.amazon.com simply-organic-certified-2-45-ounce-container dp b000ws1khm ref=sr_1_4 ? s=grocery & ie=utf8 & qid=1407029075 & sr=1-4 
wall mount only . the back support extends below the bottom shelf . 
the bottles certainly have no problem fitting . the shelves are roomy . however , the mccormick bottles tend to tip forward or backward because of the way the bottoms of the shelves are constructed . each shelf consists of several metal rods running the width of the unit and resting on the outer frame . wider-bottomed bottles have no problem , but the mccormick bottles have very narrow bottoms that wobble a little on the rods . personally , i do n't mind . i 've got a zillion bottles of spices and these shelves are an economical solution for storage . 
hi rodney ... . the distant from floor to handle is 40 inches . the basket dimensions are : height 24 , 18 wide , 22 deep and the extra basket is 18x16x7 . i have found it very useful and strong , but with the four wheels it is almost impossible to actually fold and store . no problem without front wheels though . they are easy to take off and put on . it is very light once it is assembled . good luck ! 
i have put three cat litter bags in weighing 40 lbs each and have not had a problem transporting , hope this helps ! 
a very hard plastic . this cart is great 
its about 12lbs 
there are 2 buttons for brews , one for expresso which is 2 oz and the other for coffee which is 8 oz . when i make an expresso , i usually press the button twice unless i want it that strong . 
i recieved 72 pods . which was 6 boxes . 
yes it can and each one has wonderful flavor and all is hot 
i do n't have a solid number , but the groomsmen at my sister 's wedding used them , and they are about the same size or a little larger than an eight ounce glass 
yes , but not sure you are aware that once liquid is inside the glass , the chalk on the outside disappears . i returned them once i discovered that.. 
yes they can but they have to be mason jar lids 
the handles are not hollow and the diameter is roughly 2 1 2 inches . 
i did n't try , but the top appears to allow it : ) 
yes . 
i 've put as many as 6 pair of knee high stockings in the lingerie bag and i think that it would hold even more . i 've been very happy with mine . 
i think that the bag is sturdy enough . the question is are the toys study enough . i would put the toys in the bag in the dishwasher , not the washing machine . 
would n't hold a shirt or sweatshirt it is 11 12 wide , 15 1 2 long . 
it is a very small mesh . mine did not have a chemical smell . i am delighted with mine . 
i bought a large and a medium . the large is probably about the 9x10 that you want . 
fourteen and one half inches by twelve inches . great for undies . i use it almost exclusively for bras . 
6ish 
i wear a 38f , so one for me . probably 2 if you 're a smaller size . 
jim : the nob on top of the cork screw unsrews . once it 's unsrewed all the way just slide out the old screw , and replace it with a new one . i 'm not aware of any manuals . 
i gave up on the device . i had back ups but they were of no use . i was very disappointed and wrote the manufacturer but never heard back , so i gathered they did n't care to contact a disappointed customer . i went back to the old corkscrew . good luck 
what is the question ? 
not by metrokane - by ipow . 
bed skirt , fitted sheet , top sheet , comforter , two blue ruffled pillow cases , two white pillow cases , two medium throw pillows , 2 small throw pillows ! 
it is cream 
no curtains come with the 12 piece set 
it is the same color as the face of the comforter 
machine wash cold on gentle cycle . do not bleach or dry clean . tumble dry low . light iron as needed 
i believe that it is 300. they were way softer than i expected them to be though . super comfy . 
the dimensions of this mattress are 5 '' x 39 '' x 75 '' . 
twin 
yes they will fit . . our mattresses only require a flat and secure foundation . this includes a traditional box spring , a slatted bed frame , or even the floor-just as long as the resting area is flat and secure . 
yes you can . 
this product is manufactured in china . 
about 20lbs . do not buy this . the description is horribly innacurate . it is far from a mattress ... more of a pad , in three sections , connected by fabric hinges . 
i think it would be fine . we use it as a mattress on a trundl . 
in product description it says 18 lbs ? i do n't even think it 's that much ... it seems like it was very light ? but do n't want to take off the bed to see . sorry . 
yes , it zips off . since we bought this for little grandkid visits we also bought a waterproof mattress cover to slip on top . 
no 
yes , if you do not install the desk , the bookcase can be placed at the other end . 
yes they can be switched . just not at the end where the desk is ! 
the desk is about eight inches less than the full width of the piece . if memory serves , the piece is 42 ' wide . add another 34 '' . this is not exact . i am answering from a different location . 
the assembled bed is 42.5 inches tall by 42 inches wide by 78 inches long . it is big enough to accept a twin size mattress easily . we have a 9 inch deep mattress on it , although not reccommend , as it brings the child up even with the guard rail.my granddaughter is 8 years old and we are not concerned about her rolling off . 
it 's packed flat and comes in 4 boxes : box a : 85 '' x 12 '' x 6 '' box b : 42 '' x 30 '' x 3 '' box c : 30 '' x 28 '' x 5 '' box d : 36 '' x 11 '' x 4 '' 
i know it 's a brazilian company . not a vietnamese company . unfortunately i do not remember the name of it 
it 's pine with mdf on the tops of the desk , chest , bookcase . mom 's bunk house replaces parts for up to 1 year . 
yes , there are two movable parts , the bookshelf and dresser . 
it 's a regular size twin so the bed part would be fine , but the actually loft aspect of it is kind of lost on someone that age . the ladder and accompanying desk and drawers would seem to small for a 10 year old . definitely out of range on a preteen . 
it comes in 4 boxes . 
i have n't had to use liners . i spray the pans with non-stick spray when i make omelet muffins , and today i made cupcakes and sprayed them with wilton 's bake easy ( the equivalent of flouring a pan ) . they came out fine . you can use liners if you want tho . 
10x13in 
they are graduated . 
13 1 8 '' x 9 7 8 '' 1 2 8 '' 
the measurements are 2 & 5 8ths at top and 2 inches at the bottom . 
yes , top shelf 
yes , it fits . i have both this muffin pan and the breville 800xl toaster oven . 
i says it is freezer safe . i have n't tried it myself . the instructions that came with it says it microwave and freezer safe . 
really do n't know , i assume it is bpa free because it is a premium silicone pan . 
each cup holds about 2.5 oz or 75 ml per cup . it 's really not the most efficient for freezing broth because i 'd rather have about a cup at a time . but i could n't find a muffin pan that large . but if you want small amounts , it works very well . 
absolutely for curley parsley . i just used mine for the first time and it worked great . i have n't tried it for cilantro or flat leaf parsley yet , but that top hole is small enough that it should work just as well . 
yes . but you sometimes still need to take off the individual stems by hand . 
would think so 
yes 
yes . i have been trying not to purchase made in china item but it seems that just about everything is . it is a useful little herb stripper though . it works especially well with thyme and rosemary . 
it works for any herb with a stem . 
i believe the company is based in seattle , but i do n't know where the product itself is manufactured . i do wish i had heard about this product sooner . it has made my food prep easier when using herbs . 
sorry- not yet . but it works great with rosemary ! ! 
i do not know , have used only for fresh cut herbs . however , having used it , i would think that , if the dried herbs were still on the stem , it would work . 
other than the packaging i was not able to tell the difference between refurbished and new . the unit was clean and functional , and looked like it had n't ever been used . 
mine handles dining room tables and chairs easily . as long as it can get through them . i usually pull the chairs out . the neato xv-21 usually glides around the legs , with its proximity sensor it does not hit into the legs . mine has become stuck between the legs of chairs once or twice . but it is a rarity . and usually it completes its cleaning and returns to base . 
there was one of each type of brush included with the unit . you install the brush you would like to use . 
i tried everything and had support on the phone . one thing i can say they are so helpful and will ship a replacement if you call them for help . very good customer service . i love both of mine . 
the neato xv-21 comes with a charger base , in fact , all new or refurbished neato robots come with a charging base . hope this helps . 
yes 
a little under 4 '' ( probably around 3-7 8 '' ) 
depends on when you run it ... while not in house , pretty darn quiet ; ) take a normal upright vacuum and cut the sound about in half . still fairly noisy , but the point is to have it run while you are gone . we rarely run it while home . 
nmhi 
i do not believe so . you may have to get a newer model for the side brushes . 
steel 
yes , it does 
yes , we do ship internationally . thanks 
yes , we wll refund you 10 $ if you buy 4. btw if you need more i think we should have around 8 or so 
the lid screws on tightly . the lip you drink out of snaps . i carry it around in a bag ... even when its full and it has never spilled . 
we apologize we only ship within usa . thank you . christy isale-usave ( usa ) 
yes , we do ship internationally . you can place the order online . i believe the shipping cost is 19.99 $ . thanks 
as you can see , then grater is surrounded by the metal bowl . the bowl is place to prevent for the grated coconut the fly over the place . when you plug the cord , and turn on the power , the grinder starts spinning . you insert half of the coconut on the grinder and carefully grate it , checking constantly inside the coconut so you will know what part of its meat needs more grinding . when the grinding is done , turn off the power , and be sure not to touch the grinding part for it will still be spinning for a few minutes until it goes to a final stop ... .

there 's no need to wash it with soap and water . a brush is provided to the purchase of the product . you use this to brush off the grated coconut residue that will be in between the teeth or what you call the grater.then , wipe off the entire part of the grater , not the motor part , with a damp paper towel . follow up by drying it off with another dry paper towel . that 's it ! ! ! 
this is a high speed machine . the company site gives the following specs : 120 volts , 1 2 hp , 60 hz , 3400 rpm 
exactly what part broke ? i know you can buy spare blades from the same company . it should be in the related items .

they are all capital letters and the size of each letter is about 1 inch . 
they vary in size . small part measures 1 inch and the bigger part is about 1 1 2 inches . for example , the w. the bottom is 1 in and the top measures 1 1 2inch wide . they are all 1 1 2 inches in height . 
i do n't know if it would be possible to cut each letter to use them individually . however i do n't have any problem using the letters as they are . it just takes practice . 
no , just fondant . 
not positive but , if they 're not the same they 're almost exact . love , love , love them ! i spray letter with non stick cooking spray first and they come out so easily : - ) 
approximately 1 1 4 inches 
each letter is 1 1 2 '' tall 
about 1 1 2 '' 
they are about 2inches big . they are a good size . i ordered ones b4 and they were really small but these were perfect . 
dust very well with powdered sugar or corn starch . 
a simple answer would be . . . adequately . they definitely are not as `` insulated '' as a fully insulated cup , however , they do insulate better than your basic plastic or china cup . i sure hope this vague response helps . 
yes 
china is the country where this cup was manufactured . 
i find it best to handwash it with mild soapy water . i would n't want the harsh dishwasher soap to rub off the details ! 
no , except a few texts to look like the real lens . 
yes it does . its wrapped with oversized bubble wrap to keep it from moving around in the box . 
yes 
yes , it is dishwasher safe 
nope -- it 's lined with stainless steel . 
i really do n't know i gave it as a gift 
yes . press the m ( minutes ) and s ( seconds ) key at the same time . this will clear all previous settings and silence the alarm . 
this timer `` will '' beep during the setting of the time . 
yes , it does , as long as you do n't push both hour and minute buttons to clear it . i love this timer ! it 's loud enough to hear in another room and easy to use . 
1. the kitchen timer alarm will sound for 1 minute . 2. count up means it acts like a stopwatch , you press start and it will count upward from zero . count down is when you set the time initially to say , 5 minutes , and the timer will count down until it reaches zero then the alarm will sound . for a demonstration of this facility watch the video on you tube . 
i do n't see any reason why you could not use it in a bathroom ... ( its battery operated ) ... .i do not know if it is water proof or not ... i think it is worth giving it a try ... only you can decided if the alarm is too loud for your liking . i am planning on using mine in the kitchen ... and the alarm on it is loud enough to be heard , but not annoying ... hope this helps 
no 
you hold the button down till it reaches the desired time you want . 
loud enough for my aging mother-in-law so plenty loud ! 
no . it 's a count down count up timer 
3 '' long x2.74 '' tall x1 '' deep 
no . . .you must use a pressure canner for meats , poultry and fish . this unit is n't a pressure canner . 
it is a pressurized canner , not a pressure canner . big difference . this only goes to 3 psi . most pressure canning recipes require 12-15 psi . this is a replacement for the water-bath method . 
i do n't know where phil got his info , but look at the ball website . this is not a pressure canner . no meats , no veggies , no soup . 
yes . 
i have used quart jars many times in the canner and have never had this problem . i use only ball or kerr jars . if you are trying to use mayonnaise jars or some other kind of jar other than those specifically used to can , that may be the problem . i use the canner to heat the jars and also to can them in it . i 've just made several juices in quart jars , canned pickled asparagus in quarts , etc . have you been paying attention to when the book says to use the `` grid '' in the bottom and not use the grid ? in the heating and canning process ? it can also be caused by the jar being too cold when the hot stuff is put in it . or , it can be cold stuff being put into a hot jar . keep in mind that everything has to be either hot when it is being canned in the canner . 
it does not save time but it is much simpler and uses far less water . the typical time for jams is 30 min . it also does not heat up the kitchen as the water bath method . if you pair this device with the auto jam jelly maker , everything can now be done on the counter rather than the stove . 
i am not really sure what you are asking . i successfully made blueberry and peach pie filling and canned it . if you use a thickener you will need to get some clear gel a. i had to go to nichols seed and garden in albany oregon to buy some or could have ordered it on the internet . i would suggest contacting your county extension service . i 've canned several kinds of juice that i then made into sauces and toppings . as long as the fruit is acid enough it should be safe to can . what types of sauce do you mean ? 
there is a 12-minute preheat function where you must put the empty jars in first , that is the sterilization step , you do not put in lids or rims by the way , just the open jars . so easy . i just used the canner today making cranberry syrup . i used the jam setting # 1. i love this appliance . no heavy , dangerous pots of hot water to deal with , especially in 90 degree temps like today . 
we all decide how to spend our money . i bought the freshtech last summer as a bit of a splurge and ended up using it 3-4x wk and was very happy with it . it is much easier than boiling giant pots of water and lugging them around the kitchen . it is not a substitute for a pressure cooker and if you want to can low acid vegetables , meat , or seafood , then that is what you will need to buy . most sources do not recommend canning jams or jellies in a pressure cooker because the heat and pressure are so high that it can break the jell in your preserves . this item does fill a niche , but it is niche that worked for me . i appreciated the convenience and water conservation . 
yes , i have made them using another book 's recipe . i make all kinds of recipes from other books in fact . i use the canner more broadly than just using the recipe book that comes with it . 
i live in a tropical area and have it on 24x7 lately due to it 's the rainy season and it 's extra rainy this year . it fills the 2 liter reservoir in about 12-14hrs . you can connect a drain hose to it and i recently spoke to evadry 's support about this . they said to purchase 1 2 '' id ( inner diameter ) hose as it 's almost impossible to find 12mm hose in the us . 
not at all . although it does draw enough when cycling active that you would not want some other high draw on the same circuit . this thing dry 's my 2000 square foot lower level on auto and has really helped with musty smells ! way better than a conventional dehumidifier . 
turns off . great unit but fills up with water fast ! ! 
we have not noticed an odor . 
from what i am understanding from eva dry , after the target humidity of 55 60 % has been reached , on the auto setting , only the fan runs to sample the air , until the humidity increases , then the machine changes to high speed . however with that said , it still looks like it still uses those 330 watts , i just started mine this morning also , if i 'm reading the manual right , the whole machine shuts down after 10 hours even if the timer is n't set . i like the build of the unit , and the colection bucket is sturdy as well . time will tel just how good it is also it started catching water about 20 minutes after starting the machine . i hope this has helped you , in your decision . take care , and have an awesome spring and summer ahead . 
it probably depends on how much humidity you have . the instructions say each unit removes up to 7 liters of water per day . we have a large living dining room with cathedral ceilings . we have several musical instruments that require humidity to be maintained between 40-60 % . we use two units . on auto mode they usually keep the humidity between 55-60 % . so the units are great for our needs . i should warn you that the conversion of vapor to water does release heat , so it also warms the room a few degrees depending on how much humidity it is removing . there is also a low mode that is very quiet and keeps our humidity around 60 % , and there is a high mode that we do n't use . 
when i do my homework the edv used more energy than compressor dehumidifiers . but edv 's are nice and small compared to a regular dehumidifier . 
on auto mode it takes it between 55 % and 60 % , ideal for many musical instruments . it goes lower if set to high . has a low setting for reduced noise . keeps it around 60 % . we have two running in an exceptionally large room ( combined living dining room with cathedral ceiling ) . taking water out of the air does raise temperature . less need to run as often if room is closed . ours is pretty open . 
yes , the blue led light is very noticeable in a bedroom with lights off . you could probably cover it with tape . 
i have had the unit for several weeks now . we run it in our daylight live-in basement , which gets very damp in the summer . i was hunting something that does n't make much noise , as loud dehumidifiers are annoying . i was n't even using our old unit before i purchased the edv-400 because i could n't stand to listen to it . i could tell it was getting humid and damp . when we received the edv-4000 i was a bit surprised how small it was and the bucket was small as well . but , i have been very happy with it and do not regret it , at this point . the basement feels very comfortable , it sounds like a fan , and removes a good amount of moisture . as far as 1200 sg ft , i do have less area than that where it is running . i would say if it is completely open it would help . if there are many small rooms with doors , it may be a bit much or you may need two units . 
one , i thought it was two also because of the picture but it says 1 unit in the description . 
no 
it took several attempts . i first tried peeling them off , but they left a large amount of glue . i then used goo be gone , but there was so much glue that it smeared all over . i then ran them under hot water and tried using a washcloth and soap , but that did n't work very well . finally , i took a brillo pad and scraped all of the glue off . however , it also scraped away a lot of the plastic bottle , but the glue is finally gone . the whole process took about an hour and a half . it is in the dishwasher now , very scratched surface , and i regret purchasing it . 
yes some but the only way to escape that would be if it was mesh lined . 
no , it comes without a box . 
about 16 inches or so 
i mean if you like a big old sticker on a bottle like that , by all means keep it . 
about 2.5 inches . 
maybe ? i put it in the dishwasher a few times & it did well . 
i assume so but i have n't tried it . would recommend top rack only . 
yes just unscrew the top 
my sticker came off pretty easy . i have googled before how to get sticky off of items left by stickers and i have always found dawn dish liquid to work with a mild abrasive sponge . i read vinegar works and wd-40 can help too . peanut butter ( same as when you use it to get gum out of things like your hair ) . maybe google and find out other methods but it came off pretty easy for me for some reason . 
unfortunately you only get one & # 128533 ; it 's very deceiving , if i knew i was only getting one , i would n't have ordered this 
yes , can make sun tea or use lipton 's cold brew ... would not put extremely hot liquid in it 
you can remove the straw but area remains open . 
i just checked the length and the straw is 9 inches long . 
i only recived 1 and it was broken ! 
it fits great in my car 's cupholder 
we had a 22 # and it fit just fine ... 
dear sarah , we do not recommend using your roaster on the stove top . it is oven safe to 450 degrees and is indirect heating so it does not come in direct contact with the heating element . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . audrey ~ consumer relations 
not sure it 's $ 10k , you may want to recheck the price ! it 's well made and fits well in a big green egg holding a 20lb turkey 
no 
circulon item # 56539 is made in china , manufactured for meyer corporation in vallejo , ca 94590 
no 
a standard twin is 75l by 39w . the foam topper is cut an inch or two less to make the sheet fit properly over it . if you have a extra long twin , leave the extra space at the top . because of your pillow you wo n't need the foam cushion there and the pillows will also hide the uneven plane when you make the bed . 
no . this item is not made of memory foam . i ca n't believe anyone answered yes . they must have made a mistake during the questioning process . i almost answered yes accidentally because of the way amazon asked . they said can you answer a question for this member - is this a memory foam topper ? i was thinking yes i can answer the question , but no it 's not a memory foam topper . but they only had one selection . funny stuff . anyway . you 're welcome . i might mention that my wife and i were so surprised at the comfort quality that we are going to buy another one soon . 
i suppose you could but that would obviously void your warranty . first though , be sure to measure your mattress because many sold at `` standard '' sizes are actually a bit smaller than the stated dimensions to begin with and you might not need to make adjustments . 
the box is only ( approximately ) 17 x 8 x 14. the topper is air compressed ( think spacebag ) . just remove it from the box , open the compression bag , then let it air ( to remove the foam rubber odor ) for 48 hours . and yes , the foam odor does , absolutely , disperse . after airing there is no odor . 'could n't be more please with price , delivery and quality of this product ! 
to me it smelled like formaldehyde . after letting it air like the instruction suggested , the smell disappeared . i have never smelled an odor since i started using it.. 
while it is comfortable , i would n't say it is that comfortable . it is better suited to put on top of a mattress . 
the material is not very thick and thins under weight , so i am not sure how comfortable it would be on a hard surface . it would help some though 
well the foam mattress is 2 inches thick and i would n't suggest to roll it up not unless you have room to carry it other than that is worth a try 
do n't kmow exactually but it fits the dimensions of a twin extra long bed . maybe you can google for that size . 
yes i think it can be used as seating for sofa as the foam is not very thick . 
this is a foam mattress topper . if you have a thin mattress or springs stick up then this is a good one for you . i priced others like this at $ 150 . even at walmart ! i am glad i found this because it served the purpose well . 
i put a mattress pad on it . it will keep the foam clean longer . i suppose you would n't have to . but i do 
i am a very hot natured person and just got this one instead of the blue one and it has not made me hot at all ! i love it : ) 
the foam is dense . i put it under a mattress cover to protect it from liquids and myself from the used mattress . i sleep comfortable with it . it is much better than the egg carton type . 
it appears to me to just be foam 
80 '' x 60 '' 
after you allow it to sit for 48 hours to `` poof out '' it gets very stiff . yes , i guess you could try and roll it up , but i would recommend using something strong to tye it down with , as it will take up a lot of room . good luck ! 
this is just the form . and it 's not like the smudgy foam it 's more of the stiffer side . 
not sure of the density but it is wonderfyl 
yes , will take some work . cut before it expands with exacto knife 
it is solid foam , not memory foam . 
that would depend on the size . all of these are based on standard bed sizes and leave an inch on all sides to ensure your sheets fit over the mattress and topper . the approximate sizes are : twin 37 '' x 73 '' twin xl 37 '' x 78 '' full 52 '' x 73 '' full xl 52 '' x 78 '' queen 58 '' x 78 '' king 74 '' x 78 '' cal king 70 '' x 82 '' 
http : www.ohmattress.com lucid-by-linenspa-10-inch-memory-foam-review type your question to them there . i have one and it does not catch fire but i am not the fire marshall 
this mattress topper is a semi-dense foam 
the queen size topper is 58 '' x 78 '' which is 1 inch shorter on all sides than a standard queen mattress to ensure your fitted sheet can still fit over the mattress topper . 
no ! at least my toppers did n't ... charly 
i 'm sure it can , just like any other foam topper . lots of info on how to do it if you google it . most talk about using an electric knife . just check the internet . 
no 
better than a sleeping bag but nowhere near an air mattress . a kid would b ok sleeping on it every now and then ( sleepover ) but not on a regular basis 
8lbs 2inchs thick 
honestly i do n't know what the dimensions of the king size is . i purchased a queen . 
i do n't think so . i just love the added comfort it added to bed . very happy with this purchase . 
sure ! 
its louder than a regular blender , which in all honesty i think its expected considering the amount of blending power it outputs . 
it is not recommended . the jars though are easy to wash , use the pulse mode with hot water and soap after rinsing . rinse and let it dry while standing . 
i would say wild side jar because you can do anything with it . however , the twister jar is very useful for making sauces , nut butters , ice cream . i have both the wild side and twister jars . 
it works great for apples and everything else i have put in there . i have never tried coconut , but that 's a good idea . i will have to try it ! 
this blender is amazing because not only does it blend anything you can think of , but the amount does n't matter because as the blending begins it draws down the ingredients , unlike that of a conventional blender this blender sucks everything downwards instead of up and all over the place . i use this to do green smoothies all the time , it 's the reason i bought it . it is the best most powerful blender that i know of . watch youtube '' will it blend '' see the power . and everything is blended so smoothly . absolutely no chunks . i hope that helps you . 
i 've never tried the ninja mega kitchrn system , but i 've own a ninja in the past . the blendtec was a replacement for my dead ninja ... the blend tech is a far better appliance . 
yes , easily . instructions are included in the recipe book that comes with the blender . 
i do not own a ninja but i do know that the blendtec is a high performance blender . i have made smoothies containing flax seeds , chia seeds , carrots , fruits , hemp protein and almond milk . the blendtec does a fantastic job of thoroughly pulverizing the seeds and blending all the ingredients making a great tasting smoothie . i have never found one whole seed or even fragments of seeds in my smoothie . 
i have n't tried to make soup yet , but i do use my blendtech almost daily making smoothies , salad dressings , peanut butter etc ... i have not had any problems with the lid . if this is a concern , just hold the lid down while processing . it only takes seconds for this blender to pulverize anything you put in it . 
the recipe book is in english 
the picture is shown with a tea blossom in it , but the pretty little pot looks just like that one . i love mine 
absolutely not 
from the web i learned it is made in china . 
no it is not ! i was scared to use it on my glass stove top . i boil it and then put boiling water in the pot ! 
dear tea lover , surely you can use it in microwave . all our tea-wares are made of heat resistant glass , which means the glass alone can handle temperature shock . you can take the teapot out of refrigerator ( cooler part ) and pour boiling water in . it wont break the teapot ... ; ) let me know if any other questions you have 
just about 3 coffee cups sizes . i have mine on a warmer the whole time so i ca n't answer how long it keeps tea warm exactly . sorry . but i really like this teapot and i would recommend getting it 
it comes with comfort , bed sheet , pillow cases , accent pillow and bed spread . everything you seein the picture it comes with nothing more . 
hi there - it is the actual comforter package that has a clear plastic zippered top and pink material sides and bottom . the package is lined with cardboard to help make it sturdier . i hope this information is helpful . please let me know if you have any more questions . thank you for shopping and take care . divine frills 
hi candelaria - i am sorry but i do not normally carry the full size of this comforter . let me know if you want me to check to see if i can find it for you . take care and i look forward to hearing back from you soon . 
hi there - there is a mixture of light to medium pink and purple plus a mauve color in this set . i think that this set would blend well in a lavender room . i hesitate to say that the light purple is lavender as there is so many different hues of purple lavender colors in a color wheel . the benefit of this set is that there is a wide array of colors that it should blend well in a lavender room . i hope this answer helps you . please let me know if you have any further questions . take care . 
the top is 4 1 2 inches bottom 3 1 4 , height 2 1 2 
yes 
i would not think so if your percolator has the stem coming up in the middle for the water to come through and percolate over the grounds because this basket has no hole in the bottom to fit over the stem of your percolator . 
got this is a replacement basket for a mr coffee machine about a year ago . ( if that 's any help ) 
2 1 2-3 inches.it is a universal filter basket and should fit any size coffee maker up to 12 cups . 
the one pictured in this email is the one you would get . 
solid 
i have the 12 cup . however i believe this would fit . it is a little smaller than my basket but works great . 
i do not know but the grimes stick to the basket must wash it out before putting in dishwasher 
ginger w. no ! i tried it in an old bunn i have , it 's way too small , rattles around in the basket . al 
yes , there is a zipper closure on the pillowcase . 
yes 
no . the boat is sort of a blue gray . more on the blue side . 
yes , it 's safe for machine washing : ) 
the picture is very true to color . they are red orange . i love them ! 
the product is directly from the manufacturer in india ! 
it is 12 '' deep pocket fitted sheet , it is not a misprint . 
can you please let me know you mattress size , we can send you 15 '' deep pocket fitted sheet , and also can customize it upto 30 '' deep pocket if you want , and yes the mattress we provide can fit calking bed with 3 '' mattress topper . but please advise total deapth of deep pocket , and you can go ahead with confidence , thank you 
mine had fallenout only once . just make sure you push it in really well . i do n't put mine in the dishwasher either . i just rinse after every use . maybe if you put it in the dishwasher it changed its size from the heat ? if it diesnt work then return it . good luck ! 
instead of juicing where the pulp is removed at the end and disposed of , this machine pulverizes the fruit and vegetables into more of a solid form . instead of juice it is more like a pudding . i eat my blended raw vegetables and fruits with a spoon . i make my morning drink with a whole lemon with peal & seeds removed , a chunk of ginger , a banana , a half of avacado , a whole organic apple , and a big handful of kale or greens , pinapple chunks if you have any , and add water and put the blender into action . in about 30 seconds it is an edible green shake . i add fresh blueberries on top and eat it with a spoon . delicious . it comes with a recipe booklet and you can add nuts or flax seed to it as well . you eat all the fibre with the juice so the entire vegetable or fruit is consumed . very few particles are in the mix -- depending how much water you add to the container when you are blending the mix it can be thick or more liquidy . 
sure patricia . i have n't actually made almond milk with it yet , but i put whole almonds in my green drinks and i get a smoothe finish every time . so have fun making your milk my dear . carol . 
the only time that happened to me on an old model was when it leaked and dried causing the activator to stick . short of calling customer service 1-844-696-2791 i really do n't think there is much you can do to repair it yourself . 
i would think it depends what u put in it . my smoothies contain no fat , but then i use fruit and vegetables only . calories again depend totally on you , take into consideration the sweets , adding sugar , but then i do n't have to tell you that . i am sure u can find answers going on the internet much better that i can tall you . 
works well for everything , just do n't overfill or fail to use some liquid , 
for grinding coffee and or spices 
hmm , i 'm not sure , but mine personally does n't lean and i use it every day 
milling blade crushes dry ingredients , like seeds , nuts and beans . i use it for flax seed . 
no just 120v . 
the bag is just shy of 16 '' x24 '' . i had hoped the bag would be cloth , but it is a plastic nylon material . it is a cute bag though . 
hi shellie , the bag is strong enough but i would wash it manually because of cute decor ) ) 
it 's $ 2.99 for shipping on the first item and .50c for each item after that . 
no it doesnt ... . it comes with string laundry bag 
no in a little package 
laundry bag for when you go out of town 
i think it is but it 's a pretty cheap fabric and maybe not worth it to embroider . 
it is polyester and i 'm pretty sure it can be washed . 
the height of the juicer is 15 1 2 inches the width is 12 inches the juice container is 1 liter hope this is fine 
blend to drink 
buy a different juicer i ignored reviews and bought it but the juicer kept getting pieces of black plastic flaking off.returned it . 
i do n't know what you mean `` with without the bars '' it 's not to loud . 
it plugs in electric outlet . it wastes too much of the fruit or vegetable . 
i bought a chefs star juicer , only three times , the last run only three minutes to stop moving , and now it has not been able to use , i suspect it is not good quality , perhaps my bad luck ? 
honestly i 'm not sure , i have never checked the voltage ... that would probably be a question for the manufacturer . 
two 
no . wheat grass requires a special blade in order for it to not come out stringy . 
i did n't get any instructions with it . maybe i 'm the only one who bought one . 
dimensions : 15-6 8 '' high x 11-6 8 '' wide x 3 4 '' deep . the background color of the picture is a bright orange in the daylight . it looks much nicer when it is dark out . it took me a while to find the on off switch . if you are holding the picture with it facing you , the switch is on the right-hand side towards the bottom of the print . it is somewhat cheap looking but as i said before it looks much better at night . 
all different sizes but i chose the 11x 16 ones . the depth is about the same as a canvas frame .gave them as christmas gifts and they love them . 
its smaller than i expected but still like 
yes , it is suitable for a walking treadmill without arms - such as the rebel treadmill 1000 - underneath . the desk is very stable , which makes it ideal for use with a walking treadmill . 
the desk does not come with the keyboard tray . you could purchase the keyboard tray separately . 
if a treadmill with arms could fit under the desktop then the desktop would be at a height that would far too tall for most people . ergonomic experts recommend your hands be no higher than ninety degrees from your elbows when typing . 
the desktop is 48 '' wide x 28 '' deep . 
the desk can be cranked with items on it . it 's fairly easy to crank with weight on it . 
the desk adjusts to full sitting position 
i do n't think it can be . maybe with a screwdriver . but , there 's times you 're going to want to sit . so , being able to adjust the height easily is key . 
1 2 '' thick 
it took me about ninety minutes but was not exceptionally difficult . the materials are solid . easier than a chest of drawers . 
no , the finest blade is not that fine , i think it is 1 8th inch . it is more about creating long noodle shapes from the zucchini that taste great , and are very healthy , that will go with all kinds of sauces . it will not create as many shapes as you would get with pasta machine or dry pasta 
they even do butternut squash that i can barely even cut through ! 
that 's what i do 
it is absolutely dishwasher safe , altho to be honest all you have to do is run water over it and it 's clean ... and yes , there are suction cups which hold extremely well on the counter.. just press down on each one and voila ... . excellent tool , and i 'm so happy that i bought it ... 
yes 
with the different blades , you get different types of cuts- also i think it 's much safer than my mandolin . with a food processor , you do n't get the long noodle like cuts as you do with the spirializer . i have all three but am using the spirializer most often .

hi anette , i would just be guessing , but it is somewhere around 12-14 inches long by around 8 inches tall and maybe 6 inches wide . you can go on you tube and type in spiralizer in the search bar and see people demontrating it . i also got some great recipes off that site . here is the customer service number for spiralizer , so you can get the exact measurements . i hope that helps . do n't forget , that you store the different blades for the spiralizer right on the machine so you never have to go looking for them . have fun . nell . customer service 888-739-4172 
my favorite sources of recipes are ( free ) email rss feed subscriptions & twitter for : kalyn 's kitchen ; skinnytaste.com ; once upon a chef ; food52 . after that , do a google search for specific food items , entrees , food ingredients and look at a few of the plethora of recipes that will be presented . 'save as . . . ' these recipes into a folder in your computer 'documents ' library . i also print the recipes i like . there is a 'print ' button in most recipes . or , for practical prints with pictures -- i copy paste the text into a word document taking each little section of text at a time . some pictures will print to a reasonable size but most will take up whole pages of paper . 'copy ' or 'save as ' them to a working folder in your 'pictures ' library ; use a picture editor like `` paint.net '' ( free download for individuals personal use ) if you do not already have a suitable editor to resize them . i find most pics can be reduced 50 % or sometimes to ~30.0 kb and the final print will be easy to put on the print-out page so you can have a picture . double-spaced text ( ingredients ? ) can be single-spaced , other editing done , a by-line added so you will know later where the recipe originated . comments that add to the recipe can be included this way with much editing to eliminate waste space and items . then 'print ' the final version you made in word , 3-hole punch the page ( s ) and store in a 3-ring binder . most of my personally edited recipe prints take up one or two pages ( printed on both sides of a sheet of paper ) complete with one or two pictures and the comments that provide tips & variations . clear package-sealing tape can be used on one side of these multiple sheets to hold them together in the binder . punch holes after taping . the tape also reinforces the edge for the holes if needed . if you do not have word , `` open office '' is good and it is a free download ; be very careful where you download it from . 
yes it said on the description that it is bpa free . 
the width is 10 1 4 inches . the height is 21 '' from the top of the shower head pipe to the lowest hooks . 
paper wrapping . 
i said the same thing however i did have extra suction cups from a similiar item we had before . this unit is much heaver grade than the old one and our vinyl coating is just fine . 
no , no suction cups . i used my old ones from a previous style . 
hi d. , thank you for your interests in this product . yes . you will receive the shower caddy as shown in this picture . 
yes this is a mattress and box thanks 
yes it 's a mattress and box spring set . they delivered both inside one large box . 
it can be flipped . 
yes ready to use . not compressed or rolled up . 
inner spring 
luckily i had a friend who taught me how to use it but i also used this youtube video http : youtube.com watch ? v=6wfhqkti9lo 
no 
there is absolutely no documentation in the box to say . 
did not really care for the spiralizer . it is not a peeler . was not a good buy for me even for spiral potatoes it was not an easy process 
mine did n't come with one which i did n't like but youtube has plenty of info on how to use it , the machine itself is pretty easy to put together without a manual . hth ! 
i had another bowl from my other oven which burned out , and all the parts from the quick wave match it perfectly . the extra spacer , the grills and so on . hope that helps . 
racks ! the one i got broke down on me after 3rd use 
i use the pizza button then adjust the time up or down with the arrow buttons after that press confirm and push handle down . air oven will start ! ! ! 
it is a glass bowl 
be smart and throw it away before it costs more . suggest a nu wave . i love it 
if you can set it higher then 260 degrees then it 's in fahrenheit mode . if you press the temp button you will see that celsius is set lower then fahrenheit . so when it 's 375 f it 'll be like 190 c. when i first got this i had to toggle back and forth between modes just to make sure i had it right . hope this helps 
in china . but do n't buy it . mine broke about a month after i got it and there is no website or phone number to call . it worked great while i had it . 
i have not open or use it yet . 
well , its about 3 4 inch wide . i hope that helps . 
yes -thank you for asking . the new version will be in next week . 
the whole thing may be 6 inches . the part you fill with tea is about three inches but it is round ans hold a lot of tea . do n't hesitate to make this purchase ! it is by far the best one i have ever used and bought my good friend one to after i tried mine . i love it . hope that helps . the bottom slides up and you can just dig into your dry tea and scoop it up into it with no mess and then slide the shaft down over the dry tea . great to take on the go and can be used more than once . best to you . 
no , no bend in handle . 
hi tracy , i thought no , but my husband uses it all the time . he says yes to two tsp . but not more than that . 
hi chandra , currently this infuser has wholes that might allow the rooibos tea to seep through . we are changing our design to have smaller holes for finer teas . we should have our new model in about a month . 
hi ella - yes , we will post a picture of the backside . it will show up within 1 day . thanks for your interest . 
there is a seam on the back of the mesh part of the infuser . 
it 's here - it 's here ! ! ! thank you for your patience . we finally received our new version . the new features are ; new handle for stiring , larger opening with a higher scooping barrel and smaller mesh holes for finer teas ... we hope you love it ! 
we are so glad that you asked . we are officially starting our launch next week . we will replace the current design and start selling the new one on the week on april 18th . thank you for your patience ! 
the surface of the wall must very smooth so that no air can enter the suction . if placing on glossy tile do not let the suctions cross any mortar strips . 
it did n't work on my molded-plastic type shower stall . personally , the genexice stainless steel suction cup shower basked product did n't work for because it fell off the wall every time i put it up . genexice required that i return this shower basket to china . the return shipping costs half as much as the cost of the product . 
i returned it . it did not hold . very disappointed . 
yes , they slide along the bar . read the directions about turning the inside ring to create the suction . i have to say it look really nice . 
if your marble shower surface is flat , smooth and non-porous , then suction will work . however , if the marble surface is textured , rough or porous , then suction will not work . 
it should work just fine ! my old memory foam mattress was 14 '' thick so i was a little skeptical getting the 12 '' this time around , but i am more than satisfied with my purchase of this mattress . 
its a 12 inch mattress , i think the topper is 2.5inch . its a nice mattress for the price . 
no 
it comes in a giant box . i do n't see why you couldnt store it for a couple months 
i believe it 's 3 '' of memory foam and 3 '' of pressure relief foam . i researched the mattress details when i bought it . it does n't appear on the item description , but should . 
its more on the firm side . coming from a costco bought pillowtop beatyrest this bed felt stiff . but we actaully prefer it . its a great matress at the price point . make sure you buy a breathable matress pad because it gets hot if you buy one that isnt . the package said something like 5 years on the warranty . i do n't regret the purchase at all . 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the product title , this listing is for the memory foam mattress only . the bed frame in the picture is only for visual purposes . thanks for your interest ! 
i 'm not sure if you 're asking about a specific quantified number or not . but this mattress tends to be on the firm side . it gives and cradles where it needs to , but it 's not a `` soft and sink '' feeling at all . i 've had mine for a year now , and i love mine ! 
hello , it 's 3 1 2 '' to the basket if placed on the first rung . each rung thereafter is spaced 2 '' apart . hope this helps . 
this one is wire shelves . i have this and it works great . 
my shower is tiled and have not had any problems . it 's like a tension rod so maybe check the tension on it . 
yes , the bar can be used on either side 
does not rust .. it 's been the best caddie i 've ever bought and the most useful . it 's 11 '' wide and the top bar is adjustable - very easy to put together 
possibly . depending on how secure you want them , you could glue . i wouldnt recommend drilling holes because they are fairly thin and you 'd likely destroy some leds on the edge or some of the circuit board . 
not that i 've ever noticed . it automatically turns off after a minute or two , so there really is n't enough time to `` warm up '' even if it might have done it with more time . 
42 
it definitely should ! my girlfriend and i had the same thought when i got them and i did try while wearing a black shirt , and fortunately it did shine through ! i would say the lighter the shirt , the better you 'll see the detail ! 
yea 
yes

the first few times i cooked oatmeal i did it by guess work ... i think 1 cup is to much ... make seure.your using 1 minute oatmeal too and open vent . 
it 's awesome for soup and leftovers , just not oatmeal ( unless it 's instant- which i do n't eat ) here 's info http : sistemaplastics.com products microwave breakfast-bowl plastic but not normal cheap plastic . wo n't stain or melt . we love for soup . 
you actually cook the oatmeal . i love mine . 
i have the pink and the green . i do n't think there is any bad color . 
greetings lucas , you absolutely may ! after you buy the item just send us a quick email with your color preference . thanks ! 
jennifer thompson - you have been duped like the rest of us . amazon should really make this seller change their description . makes me wonder if anyone out there is listening ? 
i usually let it hang in my decanter . hate to waste a drop of my brunello . when i have it seems to drop way less then my last one that would almost fill the stand . 
no , you do not need to attach anything . simply hold the aerator over your wine glass . with your other hand pour the wine through the aerator . as the wine goes into your glass , it aerates . it is that easy : ) if you have any further questions please do n't hesitate to contact me & we 'll take great care of you ! also , this reviewer made a video review that might answer your question here : 
to clean , hold the vinluxe under a faucet and run water through it for about 10-15 seconds . then air dry . we do not recommend using a dishwasher . 
also , this reviewer made a video review that might answer your question here : 
it does not have a metal filter that goes on top like some aerator 's have . it does however have small holes in the second stage that can filter out the larger sediments `` cork for example . '' most modern wines do not really have much sediment in them anyway , and if they do , you can pour them through a cheese cloth or into a decanter . if i am going to drink an older wine that i know will have sediment , i will pour it into a decanter , then pour it from the decanter , through this aerator and into my glass . cheers ! edit : also , no it does not come apart , that i am aware of . all you need to do is run water through it to clean it however . 
plastic 
not unless you are pouring the entire amount into a decanter . 
32 
top is plastic and bottom is glass 
they are made in china 
i fill it to the top , but your question made me curious , so i did a little comparison with my other set of cups . i think you should fill them to the top based on comparing one cup to one cup on my other set . 
no 
i 've had this `` problem '' with almost every container of liquids i 've ever owned . the surface tension of cream and milk will usually tend to make the fluid hold to the container . this can be ameliorated by a rapid `` confident '' pour which quickly gets the fluid flowing down . i have n't noticed that this `` problem '' occurs any more with these cups than any other . it 's just part of fluid dynamics . 
not sure what you mean exactly but if you want to know if there are sturdy yes very sturdy , a little on the short side 
the finish is 18 8 ; that is , the steel is 18 % chromium and 8 % nickel which , as you say , is a finish comparable to better flatware -- bright , hard to scratch , etc . as to the gauge , which is a measure of the thickness of the metal , i ca n't say -- but i can tell you that it is quite thick , heavy , and sturdy . it would take a heck of a lot to dent it ! 
yes . the measurements are stamped into the tops of the handle and are 3 16 '' tall . the top half has `` cups '' and the bottom half `` ml 's '' ( millimeters ) ) . because they are stamped they will not wear off , but depending on your visual acuity you may have to rotate it slightly , depending on the amount of lighting , to see the measures . i think it is fine , though . 
there are two measures imprinted into the handle of each cup in the set , one is in cups and the other is in `` ml . '' i 'm not sure why the other responses say only in cups . they either have something different or do not realize the second measures in ml are imprinted opposite the cup measurement . hope this is helpful . 
yes ! these are very sturdy cups and the handles are fairly short as well , so you can get a good grip when scooping heavy ingredients . 
the quality is very good with the measurements ( i.e . 1 2 , 1 4 , etc ) embossed on the handle . kitchenaide makes a set that are just like the bellemain set except there are half measurements embossed on the side . the cia set you linked appear to have inked on measurements which if true would wear off over time . 
that depends on your frame . is it open without internal supports ? how large the inside dimensions are . look at the size description on the frame info . i believe it is roughly 735411.5 inches . it is designed as a stand alone or could be used as internal frame for your futon as long as your other frame is fully supported on its own . 
the bed frame does not squeak ... and i have used two mattresses on it . 
i 'm 120 , and it holds me just fine 
it does come the tools you need . 
about 4 '' x1 '' x1 ' 
i had a couple break on me too . i contacted the company from the manual . they needed to see an image so i took a photo and sent them an e-mail with the information . i received replacements in the mail a few days later after communicated with me on the issue . i 'd make sure to list how many are broken . i got one more than needed so i kept it as a back-up in case another breaks . 
no 
from my own unit it does n't look like it would properly support rollers casters for the frame . the frame itself is fairly light weight to be moved when needed . having rollers casters on the frame would probably make it more likely to move when you do n't want it to even when locked in place . if the company makes rollers casters for this frame specifically i have not yet seen them available . i have n't found it difficult to move the bed itself when needed though , which is rare as there is already a fair bit of space below to vacuum under the bed without moving the frame . 
no it ca n't 
you can place a mattress directly on top of the frame . you can even use a bedskirt in between the frame and the mattress for a nicer look . 
about 4 '' between slats . plastic caps are slightly wider than slats . this a very light weight but efficient frame . we use it with an air mattress . 
not much just 10in 
it is strong ! it will hold at least 200 kg . 
i bought it for a higher end air mattress . the mattress has a continuous internal pump to keep mattress filled to optimum . it ( the frame ) is quite sturdy in my opinion . i think it would be fine for regular boxspring mattress or foam mattress . with my queen air mattress sitting atop of this frame , i have to do a mini little hop up to get up onto the bed as the air mattress i have is a bit more in depth than a reg box spring mattress . it is easy to put together , just do n't bend the slats too intensely as they may crack . i followed rule of thumb with the wooden slats as you would with hardwood or laminate flooring , i let it sit and acclimate to apartment temperature for over 24 hours . i think the way the slats curved upwards on both sides allows for more weight . it did give me needed under bed storage for my tiny apt . i am older and disabled and could lift it and put it together , and got needed storage , which was the best selling points for me . 
it would take some work , but it could probably be modified to attach to a headboard . 
the apple peeler is made in china . as an american it was important for me to have the apple peeler made in the us . unfortunately , after several weeks of research i found out that there were no manufacturers left in the us who can make the peelers . 
hi sandy , yes it is perfect for apple pies . i bought mine a few months ago and would highly recommend it . i have had no problems at all . 
you can use this for a lot of things , but we have only used it for apples and potatoes . i do n't think it would work good on irregular things , like pears , because the prongs are set . it may very well work for what you want ... . i 'm just not sure . i do n't think you would be sorry if you got it . 
hi mikiala puranen , filled to the brim it holds 18 oz , however , we rate it at 16 oz . so there is no worry about spillover . we hope this helps ! the chillwarmer team 
http : www.chillwarmer.com accessories you can get them on that link : - ) 
there is a very smooth internal seam . yes . 
hi ling yi , the jar itself is approximately 3 3 8 '' ( 8.57 cm ) in diameter with the bottom base at 3 5 8 '' ( 9.21 cm ) in diameter and it 's height is 6 '' ( 15.24 cm ) . hope this helps ! the chillwarmer team 
made in china ... .. 
yes , it is dishwasher safe . 
i do n't know . i 'd also like to know if the little tiny seal cap in the lid can be purchased as one got lost . 
the lid is some kind of plastic material - inside and out . 
have used the dishwasher but generally washed by hand . am familiar with a young couple with two infants that use the dishwasher extensively to clean the fun jar ... .no issues . 
hi suzanne , with the top attached , the jar itself is approximately 3 3 8 '' ( 8.57 cm ) in diameter at the top and at the bottom base is 3 5 8 '' ( 9.21 cm ) in diameter and it 's height is 6 '' ( 15.24 cm ) . with the top removed , the jar is 2 3 4 '' in diameter which is large enough to eat right out of the jar . we hope this helps ! the chillwarmer team 
i purchased a full size , and if memory serves , it was about as wide the regular mattress and it was rolled up in about a 12 '' x 12 '' x 5 ' square box . 
i do n't have a box spring with it , but it 's on a bed frame with wooden slats and works well . 
i am not too sure about it folding far enough and adjusting to the sitting position of a hospital bed like would work . the mattress is great , a bit firm but contours to your body . i know enough about hospital beds so i can tell you from the heart , this might not work . hospital beds have thinner mattresses so maybe you would be better off with a 5 inch one . the mattress is also quite heavy to handle by one person . i hope this helps some ! good luck ! isabel 
i put this mattress on top of another spring mattress originally , on a hard futon frame . however , the spring mattress just made the whole bed jiggley . mattress is lower , but perfectly comfortable on just the hard frame . in every sense except added height , the futon frame acts just as a box-spring . 
it does n't bounce like springs , most people would describe it at really hard compared to a spring mattress . but if you like the firmness you will like it a lot 
one piece ... just like a regular spring mattress 
perhaps a too mushy condition , would result , ,at the moment this mattress provides excellent softness initiatilly , and firmness at deeper penetration weight , perhaps for a medical condition , dictating furthur absorbtion , it may be advantagious , ,however for me it is perfect , as is , ! ! a foam pillow set , would be my choice in the next step , for the perfect ensemble , ! ! alan moreton , ! ! 
futon mattresses are designed to fold . this one is not . you might make it work if you strapped it down at the fold and at both ends but its 8 inches thick and will only fold with difficulty . i would n't try it . 
no , it is not ikea . 
yes it is . 
i do n't think you 'll feel him at all . that 's one of the things my wife has mentioned that she likes best about this mattress . 
there is a cover with a zipper , but i do n't think you 'd want to try to remove it . i 've had 2 of these mattresses for 3.5 years and they are in perfect condition . if you want extra covering on the mattress that is washable i would suggest a thin mattress cover . 
i bought this combination and have been sleeping on them for about a week now . perfect match and i love both ! 
product details size : queen product dimensions : 80 x 60 x 8 inches 
this mattress is the absolute best mattress that i have ever slept on , in the singular point of sleeping comfort . whether flat on my back ( the way i sleep most of the time ) or on my side , the full length of the body feels like it 's being supported equally , you sink just enough so all body parts touch the mattress , without feeling you are on a hammock . that being said , i gave the mattress away after a few weeks of trying to get used to it . getting into the proper sleeping position and turning from side-sleeping to back-sleeping was a chore . plus , other activities usually associated with lying in bed were hindered . when two bodies are lying in the same place , with extra weight being placed on one person , it is like a hammock , as far as you sink into the mattress . extracurricular activities are not well suited to this marshmallow of a mattress . but , if all you will ever do is sleep on it , this is the absolute best mattress . 
it is soft but not too soft . i find that it is just the perfect comfort for me . it gives some when you lay on it . but not to the point where you are unable to move , it other words you do n't feel like you fell in a massive hole and ca n't get out ! lol ! but it is just the right amount of comfort ! 
yeah , it 's a real queen mattress , fits perfectly on my queen frame . 
yes it comes in a box about 3 feet long by approx a foot wide 
it is amazing how compact the mattress is when shipped . i am not sure the actual package size will be of the queen size , but the package i got of a twin xl size was about 15 '' x15 '' x 18 '' . it took about six hours to fully expand to its full size . there was no odor problem detected , and none since i have had it , going on six months . 
yes 
no need to , it 's redundant unless you do n't have a wooden plank or bed frame with wire support for the mattress . 
i think it would its flexable 
the box is approx . 4ft tall and 2ft wide 
if you are just using it as a bed i do n't see why not , if it 's folding into a couch , maybe not , matress may be too thick , i think they make memory foam mattresses just for futons though . 
i think it would be like using an electric blanket which i use all the time with my memory foam bed . but to be safe , contact the company selling the mattress and ask . 
i did , but it 's difficult to get back on . 
yes but you do need something like a platform bed to put it on . it wo n't sit in like the regular metal frame by itself that you use with a matress and a box spring . 
yep , describes me to a tee . great mattress ! 
yes , the 10 inch is actually softer , we have both 8 and 10 inch . i personally prefer the firmer 8 inch , though 
yes . there is a right side up due to the layering . 
reportedly 3lb . see sleeplikethedead.com under zinus : http : www.sleeplikethedead.com memory-foam-nitetherapy.html 
i think so . hubby and i are no light weights ( in the 200 's ) and we are both comfortable on ours . however , the whole comfort thing is very subjective . 
not exactly sure how to answer your question ... .but i 'm a pretty heavy guy and i have n't had any issues with the mattress . the only thing i can say is make sure you have a tight box spring so that the memory foam does n't sink into the box . i really enjoy this mattress a lot . 
the tag on the mattress says all new material polyurethane foam 65 % visco elastic polyurethane foam 35 % outer cover 100 % polyester inner cover 100 % glass fiber it is manufactured in china and comes with a certificate of conformity from the distributor : zinus , inc in california their info is frmanager @ zinusinc.com phone 925-417-2100 all test records are there to be sure it meets federal standards of compliance . 
yes , it 's thick enough to be laid across slats , just make sure you have enough of them . it will feel the best with an even flat surface beneath it , whether you just have it on slats or on a base . the foam is thick enough and it 's sturdy enough 
i would say it is medium . i bought this for my 5 year old son and we 've had it for about 2 years now . very comfortable bed for him and even for an adult . 
it should , it 's the same size as a regular twin mattress just a bit thicker . 
in my experiences with the foam mattresses and pillows , they all have a sort of chemical packaging odor . it goes away by itself , you just have to let it air out for a few days , then it is completely gone . i do n't recommend sleeping on it until then , but it really does go away . i do n't know where you are located or what the weather is like , but you could put it outside during the day to help expedite the process . really though , do n't let the smell be the factor in not buying it . we ordered three different foam mattresses from three different places as well as foam pillows and they all had the same odor and in all of them , the smell completely vanished . 
i just used this mattress on my sons wood loft bed 
yes you do , but you can use any kind of box spring with it . i used the one from my regular bed . 
hummm the one i bought is queen , box spring and mattress set . it 's a great mattress ! so comfy ! i 've had mine a little over a year now and i never want to get out of this bed ! not sure about the twin cl listing . i 'd contact the seller to be sure . 
one box spring 
this is not a memory foam mattress . its a plush pillow top very comfortable ... . no lower back sinking ! i went into raymour and flannigan and laid down and tested the mattresses out that 's how i picked this one i wrote down the name and then went to amazon.com and they had the same mattress for cheaper ! delivered in two weeks no problems ... . hope my info was useful ! ! ! ! good luck ! 
mine came with a box spring but i 'm not sure you could order a low profile one 
don ' t know exactly ... but you can not go wrong this is the most comfortable bed ever ... .you sleep like a baby 
hello , yes we do carry this mattress in a firm pillowtop version . thank you . 
mine was a queen 
the set i purchased was a queen . 
no . only mattress and box spring . 
yes . 
no , just any support will do . slats on a frame , closely spaced , or , just any type of solid support . 
i was suprised when it was delivered ~ the mattress comes in a box about the size of a 42 '' tv . maybe a bit long . very easy and lite to handle ! 
yes you could put this on your floor . i did that with a similar mattress for years . i have it on a platform bed frame which it really just a lifted floor . 
no 
there is a cover on the mattress , but it would be difficult to remove and wash and put back on . personally i have put a nice pillow top type of mattress pad on mine so it feels extra luxurious plus i can remove it and wash it . 
i 'm not sure why not -- most any solid flat surface should be ok. of course , if the surface it 's on flexes or dips it may have some effect on how the mattress feels and responds to pressure , but i would n't think it would necessarily be a `` bad '' thing to do . 
180cmx210cm= 70inchesx82inches approx . queen size mattress is 60x80 and a king size is 76x80 . the bed you bought will not fit exactly so you will either need to buy a smaller mattress or you will need to buy the mattress from the same country you got the bed . good luck ! 
queen size 
as per the instructions provided , it says to use only one side ! ! 
got out my tape measure out for this one . height : 8-8.5 inches length : 78 inches width : 59 inches 
no , i bought a bed frame made for this product . reasonably cheap , much less than a box spring 
we ship our mattresses via fedex home delivery to your door . a signature is required upon delivery . thank you - best price mattress 
i have had mine for about 6 weeks and use it on a adjustable frame . that aspect of it is fine . i think any foam mattress ( and most spring mattresses ) are ok for an adjustable frame . still deciding whether i like the feel of the mattress itself . think i would like a softer 1-2 inch top layer , but a firmer middle layer so that my butt does n't sink in so far ( 2 inches ) . 5'8 '' male 170 lbs . 
it does 
yes . i placed mine on top of my old box spring and its just fine . 
i do n't have the density but i can tell you this mattress is slightly firmer than the tempur models . very good to sleep on though . 
it actually helped my back pain , and at the price i paid for the bed and frame , ( special frame for foam mattress ) , you cant beat it any where else . 
this is in my guest room and so far no one has slept on it . 
i do n't think i saw a warranty document with the package per se - but you can buy this without any hesitation . i 've had it for about 4 months now and have absolutely no complaints . just make sure you allow it to expand to its normal size for a day before you begin to use it 
i 'm sorry , i do n't know what density is . maybe the company it came from does ? ? good luck . 
i was never able to use the scale . a woman that weighs 125 pounds showed 280 pound . it had an `` err '' with an overweight message for me and i 'm 190 pounds . 
on the back of the scale , under the display is a button that changes the display to lbs . 
i have the app on my phone and it works just fine with the scale . is that what you are asking . i can record my weight on my phone at any time . 
i never connected this to my android , but every time i 've been asked for a pairing code `` 0000 '' worked . that 's the number 0 , not the letter o . 
i am having the same issue with an android phone . 
it does n't use a pin . you just start the app on your phone . choose measurement weight . choose a profile on the scaled itself and weigh yourself . 
that 's exactly what they 're for & they are wonderful ! ! 
i have a large hand , but never the less i was able to fit it because they stretch . i think a loose fit would actually be a benefit because it would harder to cut yourself with a loose glove . 
the gloves can be hand washed or machine washed at 80 c with a little detergent , they should be either drip or air dried , do not use tumble drier and do not iron 
this product contains 2 gloves , they are identical and will fit either the right or left hand , use both at once or keep one as a spare 
i brown meat all the time . i put in a tablespoon of olive oil and turn the timer to 15 minutes so it gets nice and hot ... leave the lid off . it browns beautiful in a few minutes on each side . i take the meat out and pour in my liquid ( stock , water , wine or beer ) just a 1 4 cup and scrape up the good brown bits then put the meat back in with vegetables , rice , etc. , and set the timer . dinner is ready in a few minutes . 
less than 10 pounds . it looks heavier than it is , and if you get one , & it 's your first one , you might consider one of his other ones with per-programed settings . then advance as you get use to pressure cooking . try stew meat & fresh vegetables , add one can of beef broth & you 'll have a meal of tender beef in less than 35 minutes . 
1200 watts 
teflon 
yes 
when you first plug it in it defaults to the warm setting , it starts the cooking cycle when you set the timer . 
3 minute increment is what it is actually . 
i would say that it is teflon . so far i have no scratches on it . 
no to both questions . but is ideal as a great dinner cooker making fabulous meals . i have never had a bad meal out of this cooker and use it a couple of times a week . 
this one is n't made for canning . 
based on the answer to the previous question about what is the max kpa ( kilopascals ) , i expect the answer to this question is `` no . '' someone said the max pressure is 88 kpa , which roughly translates to 12.75 psi . it 's a shame because they are so convenient , but i 'm not aware of any electric pressure cookers that go to 15 psi . 
yes 
not sure . i cooked a 6lb pork bbq in an hour and a half . dried beans in 45 minutes . i love mine and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to save time in the kitchen ... . 
you do n't have to push it down . when you line the steam dot with the one on the lid it lifts up letting steam out . when you set it to pressure , it drops down to seal it . it feels a bit funny because it 's so loose feeling . 
yes there are several books on the subject . truly its the best way to prepare meals by keeping the nutrients intact , listen the only thing this cant do is good camilia red beans , this takes cooking in a crock pot or on the stove ; - ) 
yes . same place and various sizes . search `` go wise stainless steel pot . '' 
1300 watts 
yes . i prefer to brown it in a pan first just because it is a bit awkward to reach in the pot . i can brown more at a time in a skillet . i also like to run the fan vent over the stove when browning . 
it has a `` saute '' setting and a higher `` brown '' setting . hope that helps . 
yes and has a self safety release button 
the cooler works between 43 and 50 degrees fahrenheit . once the temperature reaches 43 degrees the compressor turns off and will automatically restart once it goes just above 50 degrees . as per the instructions the temp can not be adjusted and the cooler does not work with an inlet water supply , only with 3 or 5 gallon water bottles ... hope this was usefull . 
there is a built in prong in the unit , just remove the paper sticker , leaving the plastic cap , then put the bottle into the unit . you will hear a pop as the prong punctures the cap . 
it does fill with water but is bad to run it while dry . you wont be able to tell how much is in it . i definitely would not use it without a jug on . 
the hwb2052 is designed to work with either 3gl or 5gl water bottles , or filter systems . the unit can not be connected to the sink water pipe . please contact customer support at 1 855 6872223 or supportusa @ honeywellwatercoolers.com for further assistance . 
no you have to buy purified water 
i do n't see why not . 
please make sure the hot water switch on the back of the unit is on . the lights will be on when unit is either heating or cooling the water inside the tanks . once the water reaches the appropriate temperature , lights will go off . 
no.. 
absolutely . in back there is a switch for exactly that purpose . so you can have cold and hot , or cold and room temp .

it easily fits 4 to 5 medium onions and 6 cloves of garlic . it is great and solved my storage problem . the onions and garlic are lasting longer than in a wire basket . 
total height is 10.5 inch and 7 inch dia . separately onion pot is 6 inch h , and garlic pot is 3 3 4 inch . 
white porcelain 
i now use the top for onions too . the few garlic bulbs i had placed in it smelled so strong , i could n't take it ... they are back to the refrigerator . it could hold many cloves ... more than i ever use . i believe it is made in china . 
no . the top is designed to fit into the bottom section , which has a flat bottom . also , the ceramic is quite heavy so you would n't want to reverse them . 
yes 
made in china with high quality white porcelain . 
total height is 10.5 inch and 7 inch dia . separately onion pot is 6 inch h , and garlic pot is 3 3 4 inch . for onion it may vary on the size of the onion 
yes . almond , milk does froth quite nicely . froth is thick but not stiff . very nice for latte . 
i own this machine , but it does not make super frothy milk . i had a similar machine that would froth milk well and expected the same from this . i do n't think it will jam with cream , but do n't expect it to be super frothy . 
i normally pour about 1 3 of the amount shown as max and the machine gives me lots of foam . good enough for at least 3 cups of cappuccino 's . 
i tried with almond milk from the fresh market ( house brand ) , i used the big round device and turn on the froth bottom . it created a lot of foam . i hope you get good result . 
no . it specifies 120v 60 hz . it might work with an adaptor ( 220v to 120v ) ? but this is just a guess , so be aware ! 
just with hot water . take out the little thing and immediate clean it after using it . no problem . 
i do three cycles to get it hot enough . 
please email me if you find a way to order them ! sully737 @ gmail i 've lost one as well . 
all you do is pour the milk in and push the button . it heats and froths at the same time , leaving a layer of foam on the top . it shuts off automatically . i usually push the button three times because i like my milk fairly hot ! 
the actual pitcher is 4 '' wide , 6 '' with the handle . the height is 61 2 '' , a little over 7 with the pitcher sitting on the base . 
this is a very large bag and extremely well constructed and should meet your laundry needs . 
this bag is more durable than the one i purchased from target . i 've used this bag for several months now and have had zero rips , tears , or broken straps . i use it to carry soiled work clothes to and from work once a week . also , i purchased the largest size available and it was way too big , you may want to consider that . 
hello , its strong but do n't think it will hold to well to send thru the cargo of a plane . 
not bad enough i 've ever noticed . 
blue 
no . not adjustable . it has a draw string close but the actual carry strap is not adjustable . 
hi miriam - hopefully other users chime in with their personal experience , but as the manufacturer i thought that i would offer my suggestion . this is a big laundry bag for sure . as far as too big ? ... that is tough to answer . when not in use , it can be very , very small as it folds up in to a tiny 'footprint ' . you also certainly do n't need to keep the bag completely full for sure . just put a manageable amount of laundry in for day to day use . we decided to offer a bag this big because we saw a lot of other reviewers on similar products that were on college campuses or military bases . those folks needed a bag with a shoulder strap ( we solved that ! ) and needed it to be really big for trips home from school or when travelling away from base . your question is subjective , of course , but i hope that i was able to provide an adequate answer . chris k keeble outlets 
yes ... i washed it in cold water and hung to dry ... perfect 
about 24 inches 
first of all this is not a small bag , these hold a ton of stuff . there is a very large grommet at the top of the strap and across from the strap on the top . for if you wanted to double tie it . there is not one on the bottom of the strap , but it is well made and is holding up . it also has a draw string at the top with a plastic piece that keeps in in place ( i forget what they are called ) and that is nice as well . keeps everything inside in case the bag falls over . after weeks of hauling salon towels , holding up great . 
induction-compatible cookware contains ferromagnetic materials - in other words , it contains iron , or has a layer with magnetic properties . cast iron , enamel cast iron and most types of stainless steel cookware are all induction compatible , but not all types . aluminum , copper or glass cookware will not work unless they have a layer on the bottom with magnetic properties . to tell if a pot or pan is induction-compatible , hold a magnet to the bottom . if it clings , the cookware will work on an induction cooktop . also , many manufacturers have started putting an `` induction compatible '' symbol on the bottom of their cookware or they 'll note compatibility on their packaging . the symbol often looks like a horizontal zig-zag or a coil .

5 '' and 9 '' . i am enjoying the roswell and use it constantly . 
the surface only gets hot because the pan is hot due to the contents of the pot being heated . otherwise the surface does not get hot in order to heat the pot . there is much less heat on the surface that a normal electric stove as a result .

well ... ..this ih cooker is not able to be activated when there is no suitable material ( iron ... etc ) on it . you might have to modify the circuit board to turn off the sensor . 
yes you can use a standard 120 volt 15 amp . outlet 
interior dimensions where the mattress sits are approximately 81 1 4 '' x 60 1 2. length outside measurement is 84 '' plus ( in case you need to be really specific ) there are little caps that cover screw holes that add perhaps another half inch to the length . width outside measurement is 63 1 4 '' . those measurements were taken at the corners of the bedframe - the rails on the sides and at the head and foot are set in just a bit from the corner . height overall is 13 3 4 '' and there is clearance of 8 '' between the floor and the bottom of the rails . 
yes , as depicted , the color is more of a medium cherry with brown . thank you for your inquiry . 
well ... if you wanted to drill holes and screw them together , sure . there is n't any sort of built-in brackets or anything . 
i do n't have that information , but `` google '' best price mattress '' to contact someone there who can answer this question for you . 
the wood is from malaysia . 
i would guess you could . you would need to put risers on the 4 middle supports also . i do like the frame . 
i could not even get them to send me the correct pieces to the frame ! it took me over a year to get my refund . i do n't know that i would risk trying to get what you want . 
floor to top of slats looks to be right at 11 inches and floor to top of frame at the corners is something like 13 7 8 inches and slightly less than that not at the corners . 
i weigh 240 and it handles me fine , and with my wife as well . as i put it together it was obvious it was a good piece of furniture . 
unsure of the total weight , but it can be taken apart if you need to move it . 
thanks for your question , yes , this listing is for a pack of 2 rolls at 25 feet each . i hope this helps ! 
clear 
it 's solid . i live in a relatively dry climate so moisture has n't been a problem . i am not sure how it is in a more moisture driven climate but i can tell you i have never appreciated a shelf liner so much . this stuff is great ! 
yes 
no adhesive . i have just moved into a new house and have lined every cabinet and closet shelf with it . just takes time to measure and cut . i find it easier using a straight edge and mat knife 
ribbed side up , always . when used with glassware , plates etc. , the ribs enable air circulation . if ribbed side is down , it may trap moisture and cause problems with shelf finish . i always use ribbed liner because you never know when the purpose of a shelf will change to dishes and glassware . 
i received two rolls and each roll was 25 feet long . 
they 're lined but not insulated . 
yes 
yes 
they are metal ... ..so depending on how you would hold the handle would determine if it would be too hot to hold ! i have not tried hot drinks ... only use for cold ! not sure if something hot would make the copper change color ? ! ? sorry , do not have a definitive answer for you . 
there is no dark spot . that is just a reflection . the cups are beautiful ! 
no they are n't but they are great ! we love them . easy to carry hold and keep your drink colder at the end than at the beginning . 
the ones i got are 16 .

this set of mugs is 16ounces each -- the perfect size for a moscow mule . i find that the 20 ounce mugs are just a smidge too big . fill to just under half with ice and then add -- 1 2 ounces fresh lime juice , 2 ounces vodka and then 5.5 ounces ginger beer . give it a mix and serve . if you 're feeling crazy , add a sprig of mint . : ) i ca n't even count how often i 've used these mugs since i got them a couple months ago . they are great . 
the perfect size for a moscow mule ! and easy to hold in your hand ... .unlike some i ordered from another site ... . they looked like soup bowls . these are perfect ! 
i purchased the same product at 2 different times and both are `` brooklyn bedding '' , i 've been extremely pleased with all 4 pillows . reason for buying was i was tired of purchasing pillows from the retail stores and them loosing their fluff within 2 months . i 've had my 1st set of pillows for several months now and are still in perfect condition . 
it looks high when you first get it . but , after sleeping on it a few times it goes down . had mine for a couple months now , and it settled to mid way between high and low . 
the queen pillow is 20 inches x 30 inches . the standard is 4 inches shorter in length . the king would be 6 inches longer , but would be a better fit for a queen size pillow . 
i dont think so . it is very lofty and sleeps very cool . if you have broad shoulders and are a side sleeper it is perfect . it is very full and does not fluff much . i would look at the linen spa shredded latex if you want talalay and some maneuverability . 
yes . you can unzip and wash .

if you 're looking at the front- ( where there is a silver circle button to turn it on ) , turn it around , and the lower back side , where the silver bottom is higher up along the blue , there is a tiny little button , that if you push , it pops open the battery chamber . just turn it around , and feel the silver back side , and you 'll see : feel it . it 's super easy once you see it . battery directions ( + , - ) are written on it , and labeled on batteries as well ! let me know if you need more help ! 
that 's what i use it for . dave asprey recommends a blender but this is so much easier . 
i heat almond milk for about a minute in the microwave , in a glass measuring cup . frothed up fine for me . 
i have had mine for only a month and i use it about every day . i have had no problems with it so far . 
it 's made in china . i would not waste my money on the epare milk frother . a better buy is the aerolatte frother ; i have two of the aerolattes that come with a travel case ; they work great ! 
it does not come with a stand . 
i do n't think it is strong enough to do stuff like beat eggs or whisk cookies . it is great for mixing my coffee with cream though . 
yes , you have to 
mine is fine . you have might be defective . why do n't you get in touch with the company ? 
no china.and it isnt goose down . it is just regular poly filled . misinterpreted information . 
believe it 's home collection . they were a gift so i ca n't verify . 
hello l robertshaw , please check this cover out : search of asin : b00mua3gfe in amazon . 
no it does not bounce back . however is fairly comfortable no complaints from the wife 22 weeks in . 
no 
hi , i do n't think that it is . keep a cover on it so you can wash that . 
anita , it is a bit under 2 inches ( 5cm ) in diameter . thanks for your question . don ( schefs ) 
paulk - that is absolutely correct . pushing the plunger part of the handle extends the bottom bowl so you can use it as a measuring cup to get the right amount of tea . releasing the plunger closes the two halves . hope that helps . don ( co-founder , schefs ) 
i believe it is a level tablespoon , that is about the amount i put in it . 
no ! 
the plunger 's only function is to open the ball . it causes one half to slide away from the other half for filling and emptying . 
yes it is good quality . too much sedimate for me . 
no bags ... you use loose tea 
looks like the ball part could be . and the handle maybe not . there 's really no way i would know for sure . i 've long thrown the packaging away . 
not sure , i would think it depends on how fine . i use green gunpowder style but that is a course leaf tea . 
mary , it is just about 7 inches tall . not sure about fitting in the tumbler , could n't find the specs on the teavana website . don 
i never counted , the apple looks like a spiral of apple when done , like an accordian of apple , all cored too , then if you cut in half you have apples being ready for a nice pie . used to have one when i did daycare , the kids were so delighted with it 
my experience : there are no differences except for the paint color . to my knowledge all are made in china . i have bought several as gifts from different companies on-line and retail . one ( green color ) i bought from bed , bath & beyond several years ago and still used frequently was $ 19.95 less a $ 5.00 certificate . go for your best price . loopy is a good company . received in 3 days after ordering via amazon . 
i try to find the most regularly shaped apples for that reason . sometimes , however , the nicest ones are not so perfect in shape . i figure if i have to do some touch-up it is still better than doing it all by hand . my issue with this device is that there does n't seem to be any way to adjust the thickness of the slices , and that is something i would like to be able to do . 
we just recieved this a few months ago and peeled @ 10 lbs . it worked great . 
the arm attachment does not extend that far . 4 '' diam is about as large as you will be able to get through it . 
yes , it does work on softer vegetables , like zucchini . you 'll have to cut the vegetable to fit into the space between the fork and the blades . you will get a core which you can chop into smaller pieces or leave as a thick chip . please note that the peeler wo n't work on pitted fruit like peaches as the fork will not be able to pierce the pit . 
the peeler is made in china , carefully selected from several manufacturers . new packaging will be released on 1 may 2014 together with updated instructions and a free recipe ebook . we will send the recipes and instructions to all customers who bought the product before the packaging was updated . appreciate your patience . new exciting colors will be introduced on 1 june 2014 . 
no you can not adjust the slices , but it 's the coolest little gadget that i have purchased this year and the kids love the slices ... 
yes - do it all the time 
have n't really had that issue . i guess it would depend on how much is spilled ? for me typically there are just a couple drips that might run down the cup and never even get to the `` saucer '' just a nice backup to full saucer 
it 's an 8oz mug . 
i have only hand washed it , slide the washcloth or sponge between the bottom of the cup and the coaster and then rinse does it . i 've also have had no problem with coffee or tea stains , which had been mentioned in other reviews . excellent product , really ingenious design . we love ours . 
i use mine with my keutig . make sure it 's set on the 8 oz . 
being a porcelain product , the height will vary with each unit , but approximately 4.6inches 
overseas i think it was funny because it came from over there and i had to send it to england 
one 
it seams to be . this is actually a very nice and strong cup . i had ordered a cheaper one and broke it before i used it . this is a quality cup . 
you can add if you have them ; they come out easily ( and go back in easily too : - ) ) . it depends on what you are going to hang and how much space is going to take . 
here is a link to the installation video http : glideware.com video i put 2 screws in the door frame . flush with the cabinet frame and 2 screws in the back of the cabinet . i too have a drawer above . it worked out great . 
the width of your cabinet needs to be 2 '' wider than the width of your largest pan . so , for example , if your largest skillet is 12 '' , the opening of the cabinet should be 14 '' . this will give you 1 '' clear space on either side of the pan when glideware is extended . 
i do n't know if it 's can be removed but i would check with the person you are having install it . it is wonderful , i love mine and it 's well worth the price . 
the glideware unit is 5-1 4 from the top of the unit to the bottom of the hook . subtract the height from the overall opening to determine if it will fit your pans . the length of the unit is 22-1 4 '' and all standard 24 '' depth base cabinets . 
a standard cupboard is too short for the biggest pan to glide on this organizer . we had to send ours back , but glideware was suppose to come out with smaller hooks 
i can confirm that it comes with seven . 
i do n't think so . you just lift a little to get the pan or pot off . there is contact but it 's not like banging . 
the answer will vary depending on what type of cabinet doors you have . if the doors are not recessed ( the lip of the cabinet door rests on the outside of the cabinet frame ) , then yes you can use this organizer . it attaches to the back wall and to the inside of the front frame . if you have more modern , recessed cabinets with drawers above ( like mine ) , then no , you wo n't be able to use this unit . attaching it as designed to the inside of the front frame prevents recessed cabinet doors from closing . 
yes cco9 , contact me for shipping charge 
it runs continuously . i have a device that measures electricity costs and if the fan runs 100 % ( without the compressor turning on ) i am showing only a cost of about $ 2- $ 3 per month . a lot of models seem to be this way ; the claim is that it keeps the air circulating and makes the unit more efficient to run . if it prolongs the life of the device ; it will be worth it in the end . 
the tank for catching the water is 9.5 pints the 70 pints refers to the amount of water per day it will remove 
yes , and at the bottom front half . 
once the item you are fermenting is finished , it will need to be refrigerated or it will continue to ferment . you can not store it in a cupboard or pantry , only the refrigerator . in the past if have froze sauerkraut in small containers and just thawed it in the fridge when i needed it . : - ) 
i believe it is a galvanized stainless steel . i have been using mine for a few months , and they are in perfect condition . also , the food does not touch the lid anyway because you have to leave about an inch or two at the top for the bubbles and air . 
yes , small glass ones that work fine 
it is a 12 pack , i have corrected the listing , but it may take a few hours to post . 
when the box was delivered all three bowls were stacked inside the other with the lids on top . 
these bowls are not dishwasher safe . 
no is not water tight 
they come off with a determined child . i would n't trust them . 
no you can not the outside is plastic and the inside is metal 
the thermobowl has a very good locking lid 
the color is as shown on picture . 
yes , of course . 
yes it can . just watched a review on youtube actually with same subject before seeing your question here . he compared the 600 & 900 watt versions . he blended celery ( +a little water ) for same amount of time ( 20 sec ) , then he poured each thru mesh screen , both models left no evidence of stringy bits , only smooth fine pulp . hope this helps ! 
no pulp , it is amazing . even berry seeds break down ! 
contact manufacture is a good solution 
i have had it for about a month and have used it twice a day without a problem . the o ring came out once but was easy to put back in . i went ahead and bought a couple replacement just in case it happens to break . as long as your careful about what you put in it like too much frozen fruit , dates and the like , you should be ok. when it has trouble mixing , just take the container off and shake it , which you may have to do a couple of times as well as add some liquid . always clean everything as soon as your done by rinsing under hot water and dry it . most of problems people are having are caused by themselves pushing the unit to hard . it never takes more than 30 seconds to blend anything . go on youtube for ideas to . enjoy 
there are two kinds of blades for the nutribullet . the first contains a double set of blades which pulverizes and purees wet foods . the other contains a single blade designed to grind dry foods such as nuts , coffee beans etc . 
it does n't chop up frozen fruit and seeds well at all . 
i use mixed flash frozen berries which gives me the same nutrients without having to worry about fruit either spoiling or running out . i mix with silk almond milk for further nutrients & a smoother smoothie . both give me the coldness and eliminate the need for ice so my smoothies are more nutritious and taste less watered down . also if you do n't use filtered water for your ice cubes , you can get a bleachy taste and chemicals from treated water . if you still wish to use ice cubes , there is no set number , it all depends on keeping your ingredients below the max line , which is another argument against their use as they take up so much space . 
it 's easy to wash if you can get it to work : - ( 
no , it does n't extract . you could use a high power hand blender and get the same smoothie effect . 
these have a 1.6 lbs . pull force in ideal test conditions . they are n42 . know that the higher the n # the more fragile the magnet . the magnetic strength per weight can increase but with that they increase in brittleness , they can break to pieces much easier . n42 provide the magnetic strength with durability for the best design for craft magnet uses . 
yes i think they will work for that . for there size they are real strong . 
not sure what you mean by `` on fabric . '' if you use them to attract a metallic object like a political button through a sweatshirt then yes they are strong enough . 
yes you would . i use them in the freezer . the only thing is it may be hard to get the label off once you use them in the freezer . 
cinthya , this is anthony wayne , founder of chalky talky . the answer is yes , you can wash them in the sink without removing them and they will stick . with that said , we do wash these labels on jars at our home , but not in a commercial setting . i am not sure if you are washing multiple times a day how long they would stick . however , if you do go ahead with it and they do not last to your needs , please drop me a line and i will reimburse you . it would be interesting to know that data . i have a feeling they will outperform expectations , even in commercial use . that would make for a great review ( hint , hint : ) ! 
there are 3 different designs in the package -- 12 of each 
no not index size its 2 3 8 '' x3.50 '' 
real chalk , i really like them ! 
i am not sure about the heat i used them for canisters . 
the only thing i can say os that , i use them on mason jars and they did not leave any glue residue when i take them off so i dont think it can damage clothing 
i tried it and it works i could take it off with out leaving any residue , but i dont know what would happen in the long run 
they would make perfect drink markers . it has been our experience that they do n't leave any residue and they are easy to remove . if you are placing them on jars that you plan to reuse as drink holders again i would hand wash those jars with the labels still on them ; the labels do stay on . 
it does not come with a pen . 
i believe it would melt the top . 
my # 1 best meat thermometer gives me a reading in less than 10 seconds . i 've only used it on chicken @ 165 degrees . it might take longer on higher temps . 
no absoluty not . 
no , it is n't . it will get ruined as there is n't a waterproof seal . 
it is an instant read so use it whether you are grilling , baking , pan frying or whatever . this is a great unit , i wouldnt be without it and actually bought one for my parents as well . 
no 
i have not had any problems . i use avast for an antivirus and they filter all the junk mail . 
it does n't ! ! ! it broke after the second time . beware do n't buy ! ! ! 
china , where else ? i must say that the probe is stainless steel ( the only part that touches food ) and well manufactured even if from china . 
it does n't say anywhere on the thermometer , but i would assume it is manufactured in china , as are most items of this type 
mine did 
any vacuum pump will work so long as it seals against the black plastic disk seen on the top of the lid . i used an normal electric vacuum pump with a plastic hose held against the disk . does n't take much effort or time as mason jars have a low volume . 
hi jennifer . yes , we do sell the lids without the pump , both the regular size ( small lids ) and the wide mouth size ( large lids ) . see here http : www.amazon.com mason-vacuum-packing-5-pack-regular dp b00nye8tys ref=sr_1_5 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1412049648 & sr=8-5 & keywords=thriftyvac regards , tom cannon

yes and works quite well . 
hi s. this product comes with five wide mouth mason jar lids , that have air valves attached to them ( the black object in the center ) that only allows air to flow out the mason jar . the white vacuum pump in the photo fits the air valve ( called a check valve ) and lets you manually vacuum out the air . you can release the vacuum by pressing on the side of the check valve , as shown in this video : https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=wjbvzbciqcy & # 8203 ; regards , tom cannon 
the `` standard '' size thriftyvac mason jar lid ( patent pending ) fit `` regular '' size jars and are 2.75 inches in diameter . the wide mouth lids are 3.375 inches in diameter and fit wide mouth jars . 
they fit the wide mouth , store bought , mason jars . as an aside , these things are awesome ! i keep all herbs , spices , seeds , grains , coffee and whatnot sealed up and they are very fresh when opened . this little device does get bunged up if you try to vacuum seal powders though . just keep enough head-space between the lid and the powder so it does n't get drawn up and it will seal fine . 
yes but air dry to avoid cracking over time 
yes . the manufacturer offers an adapter that mates the foodsaver vacuum hose with the thriftyvac check valve , the black center piece of the thriftyvac mason jar vacuum lid . 
hi bridget . yes , but be sure to order the `` wide mouth '' vacuum lids , because half gallon size mason jars only come with that size opening . regards , tom cannon . 
yes , provided you have the thriftyvac check valve adapter . however , you can get a much stronger vacuum using the manual pump that comes with the thriftyvac system , and you would not need an adapter . 
yes it does . and it works wonderfully ! ! in fact , it works better then some of mine more expensive sealers 
amazon sells them ! 
the set includes the comforter , one bed skirt , 2 pillow shams , 2 european square shams and 2 toss pillows . 
sorry , we do n't have it

no you will not ! there are replacement battery packs you can get , even here on amazon . i own a dc44 and the battery pack is a 6 cell 2000 mah battery from factory , so if you get one aftermarket you have to get at least 2000mah or you will have less run time if you do n't . they will have replacements for this model as well as soon as they update their products . i do n't know the spec on the dc59 though . ******edit***** 2 18 14 i now own a dc59 animal and what a difference in suction ! ! ! way better . the battery has 2100 mah battery pack and is now held in place by small screw . but still easy to replace and yes dyson sells them for around $ 70 each and a charger for about $ 30 
actually,110-240v.all dyson cordless cleaners is ok from 110v to 240v . 
see my review -- the charge does not last 26 minutes under any circumstances . they say `` 26 minutes '' because they include the time you 'll be carrying the vacuum around without pressing the trigger ( yes , seriously ) . on the non-max setting , you can expect 20 minutes if you do n't use the motorized attachments , and 17 if you do . on max it 's 6 minutes ( not sure if that 's the same with or without the attachments ) . 
i think the difference between the dc59 animal and the dc58 non-animal ( i do n't believe there is a non-animal dc59 ) is the attachments . the dc59 comes with the long floor attachment to allow the vacuum to be used as a full length floor vacuum ( along with a bigger carpet attachment ) along with several other upholstery and a ceiling fan attachment . the dc58 just comes with the regular attachments but does n't have the long tube to extend or any of the powered attachments . so basically you 're paying extra to be able to use this handheld like a full size and have several attachments designed to get pet hair ( and other stuff ) off the couch cushions and the stairs and the ceiling fan . . . 
sure ... .it 'll get those pesky cheerios ! 
the charger base is 3 1 2 inches wide and 11 1 16 inch long . but you do n't have to put it on the base to charge it . the charger base just gives you a place to hang it . the charger itself is separate . i charge mine with the charger and i do n't use the base at all . 
yes 
this unit just came to market so as far as life span no one knows yet . but i will answer on previous model . if you take care of it like anything else ; it should last a long time . i used my dc44 about fifteen minutes daily on average and had it for about two years and never replaced battery or had the need to . the run time never diminished over the two years and nothing broke on it either . just take care of it ie . taking out the wound up hair in the beater bar and cleaning filter once in awhile you will be ok . 
i 've never timed it with precision , but i think it 's about 3 hours . 
hi , here is a link on how to install the caddy - https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=ola1kuzuj3s . i am sure you can find more on-line or on youtube . the caddy holds the attachments . 
i am not familiar with the eureka easy clean but i am not overjoyed with my dyson either . it is just not the quality i was expecting and i find it awkward to use . it does not last very long either on the battery . sorry to disappoint you - i love my other dyson products . 
its the charger for the battery . note that the device can not be used while charging . 
works for 17 minutes then dies . bummer ! but recharges in about an hour . you can do the entire car in 17 minutes ! 
the attachments from my previous handheld ( 5 or 6 years old ) did fit my new handheld . 
only 2 , the brush and the thin one . 
well i think they are the same thing , totally identical in the key parameters . and i also received a dc58 . 
it does work for pet hair but i think you 'd be better off with something more powerful , less portable , and longer lasting for a sofa . 
yes . 
i do n't have a cat but from my experience the best solution for pet hair is a moving brush , which does not come with the dc58 . the vacuum is quite powerful but as you know , pet hair is stubborn . if you add the rotating brush ( `` dyason tangle free turbine '' - http : www.amazon.com gp product b008sh85j0 ) my guess would be that it would do quite well on cat hair . 
no 
made in india 
no it 's not ... it 's the same material as outside ! 
yes i have the bowls and they do nest for storage but with the lids off of course which need to be stored seperatly . 
no , the cover is not a good fit . it wo n't hold anything liquid . overall , i 'm not happy with the design . because of the loose fitting lid , the food does not only leak but cools rather quickly . 
no these dishes are not dishwasher safe . they will expand and come apart in the dishwasher . 
these dimensions are for the box the thermodishes sizes are the largest 9x9x4.5 the med . 6.5x6.5x3.5 the sm 5.5x5.5x3 and its designed to nest one in each other to save space . 
if the thermodish is used with proper instructions both hot and cold hold the temperature up to six hours . 
the thermo dish is not sealed but has a locking lid so if its in an upright position it wo n't leak . 
i think they have a shop in usa but it is an indian product i think . not sure . but it is good quality : ) 
these are really great mitts and i 've never felt heat while holding any pots or pans . they are really thick and padded . 
they are very flexible and very comfortable to wear . they provide a good grip too . 
no the lining is not removable . you can turn it inside out and wash . 
no 
yes , they are interchangeable 
no 
yes . 
two 
they are made of a flexible silicone material with a inner cotton liner that is quilted 
yes , they are really thick . 
it 's so tiny that it cools ( or warms ) the person . yes it has a fan only setting . 
this heater is wonderful , my son wants to buy one ! it is 9 1 2 inches wide and 10 inches tall . it could go under your desk if your desk is big underneath because this little heater kicks out a lot of heat on high , but i guess if you have it on low , it would be ok for under the desk , because high would be too much for your feet and legs . any other questions i 'd be glad to answer , so enjoy it ! ! 
the cord is about 6 feet long . 
i got ta say i feel it 's pretty quiet and i 've my share of heaters in the last few years . the best part for me is the dial because i have bad arthritis it 's just super easy to use . i spoke to my mom this morning on speakerphone next to the heater as i have a north facing apartment and it 's cold , but she did n't say anything and i could hear her just fine . hope this helps ! 
heater needs 110-120v - normal u.s. household outlets . 
no it needs to be plugged in to an outlet 
it 's quiet i keep it under my cubical and nobody hears it and we 're pretty close to each other 
i do n't know what turnover protection is but maybe this will help , there is a button on the bottom and if that is not flat on the surface the heater will turn off or will not turn on . 
wattage on low setting is 750 and the amps usage is 60 
no to small 
it working great and a perfect fit for my blender 
there is no imprint on the blades . the metal base is imprinted with `` rubber ring side `` in english and spanish . 
i have no idea but if its the basic model and looks like it why not take a shot ... you can always send it back if it does n't . 
it fit my oster . do n't know about the 10-speed blender service # 6630 
if they are the same size as a standard blender i do n't see why not but i do n't have those to test . 
there is not enough information in your question . you need to provide a model number . and you can usually ask the company directly , although sometimes they jump on here and answer ! good luck ! 
laura , if your original blade assembly base plate diameter is 2-1 2 '' , this will fit 
i ca n't say for certain , but i do n't believe it is . it does n't have the oster label anywhere on it . but it is exactly the same size and shape as the one i had and works perfectly with my blender . i have had no complaints with it at all . 
yes 
the remote has a little light bulb on it that you press and you can change the color of the light . the lights are not that bright , its more of a background glow type of thing . 
yes 
it wo n't stand up plus it needs ventilation it 's really made to be hung on a wall you would also lose the lights on the side 
the heat comes out of a small vent on the top 
on this one , they heat comes out top . if i recall , it is nothing flammable within 12 inches . i found a neat , metal `` shelf '' @ hobby lobby to use as a mantel , of sorts 
i will measure and get back to you just email me at ventersorlando @ yahoo.com 
no it is n't . it runs continuously on a high or low setting . 
yes it does . it was supposed to come with the floor stand too , check the fine print with your offer because i did not receive the floor stand and had to contact them to send it to me separately . 
it 's no bigger then a 32 inch fall screen tv and with stand it 's about 2 inches bigger . this is in our family room on top of a wooden dog crate and it 's amazing and every one loves it . we are satisfied . 
not sure of difference , but i love mine . i have a choice of logs or stones in mine . i paid a similar price for another one at costco , but much much smaller . 
this grinder grinds very well . if you turn it back upside down , and grind with it upside down , it will grind extremely fine . definitely enough for a vape . but not on the first grind . hope that helps . 
yes 
yes..you certainly could ! it might be a bit tricky like you 'll have to cut the cinnamon sticks in pieces first then grind it , same as the cloves . the teeth of this grinder is extremely sharp so i warn anyone using this grinder on not throwing caution to the wind..it could cut you without you even knowing it so be very careful using this . other than that it 's a superb and finely made grinder . i have used mine for many things including herbs like thyme and rosemary , whole peppercorns and big seeds . a highly recommended product and you can not possibly go wrong getting this for yourself for it comes in handy . i hope i answered your question . : ) 
by far its tge best grinder ive owned you may have to clean it because it gets sticky but other than that it still polverises even the densest . product ad the keef it collects is outstanding best ive seen other than a space case 
i 've had the opportunity to use a space case for a short while . i want to start by saying it is a really great grinder and that i can see why it 's considered the best . both griders do the same thing , not one better than the other . i would say the space case is built a bit more heavy duty , but that is mostly for aesthetic purposes . what it really comes down to is if you want to spend that extra money for feel , not extra function . the ggg really is top notch . it looks great , grinds well , the keef screen never clogs , and there is plenty of room in the middle chamber to store . space case is viewed as the best becase it has function and feel , but that comes at a price . ggg gives the same level of functionality , with slightly less aesthetics , for a much much much better price . so overall if you have cash to burn i guess get the space case , but really your not going to get much more bang for your buck . 
it grinds both very good . i used dried when i got it and fresh a few days afterwords . its good for either ! 
manual . but it 's a very smooth twist . 
antonio , thanks for the question . the magnets are very strong and just in case you are not totally satisfied , write me and i 'll take care of you . no worries at all . 
yes it does an amazing job with fresh herbs ! 
this grinder can handle small or larger quantities quite well .

99 min . and 60 sec . i love the little thing . 
only about 15 seconds , then stays silent . if you miss the alarm you 're out of luck ! 
yes . if you buy that many we can eliminate the shipping charge 
about 1 2 inch wider than a credit card at the rounded top and about the same length 
yes , it has a little metal piece that you can use as a stand 
yes , it can ! it can count down even 1 second . 
aaa 
hi , it is white and i have only had it months and it looks horrible . the white side is pilling horribly . a million balls everywhere . it looks bad . i tried to return this as i feel it is cheap material . 
it is shades if green if you email me at lisag30 @ yahoo.com i can send you more accurate photos from the actual product . shams are not sold with this item but are available . when you email me i can send the amazon links for purchasing the item . thank you hope this helps 
110 x 96 `` it is cut to have shams . if you email me at lisag30 @ yahoo.com i have more pictures if you would like to see the fabric and bedspread . if you would like to see the color better . 
big enough to amply cover a king size bed . look up dimension for king size beds !

i have not used since winter . texas is hot after may . i use in my rv . i think it has a default setting 
three heating settings : eco ( 750w ) low ( 1000w ) high ( 1500w )

you mean bpa ? i do n't think it mentions in the manual , but the smaller containers are all glass and the strainer seems to be made of something like pet . the bigger container is probably the most likely to have a bis phenol issue , but if it bothers you , some small canning jars the same size as the included jars will work pretty well . 
if you are experiencing any kind technical difficulties , please contact oster direct for more trouble shooting assistance . 
yes the lids are on 
yes , i actually use 2 one quart plastic containers much like the included one with great success . the lid of the yogurt maker does n't fit all the way down but i increase the cooking time to 12 hrs . the mason jars work the same . i like greek yogurt so i use the larger quarts and strain , then i fill the mason jars . 
yes . 
no , this model does not automatically shut off . i do n't find it to be an issue , though . 
definitely yes . i do it this way all the time . i just double my recipe and put part of it in the jars and the rest in the container . it works fine each time i 've done it . i think you 'll be happy with the results . 
every time i put that large unit differently and see no difference . so i guess you can put the glass jars instead of it . 
no did not look for glass container . two large would fit , but i only have one . 
the ckstym1012 does not have any replacement parts . 
it is not u.l approved it is etc conforms to u.l std . 1278. this heater does n't do what they said it would do . it 's supposed too heat 1800 square ft. not . have to put it 2 feet away to warm my feet . have two of theses heaters only a 900 square ft. house @ 25deg outside . inside 57 deg . have to run two more heaters with them to keep my house warm 
actuallay its plastic ... metal on the rear of it.. 
hello , sorry we do not sell parts for this particular item . thank you 
no both of mine start in off mode . 
there is a vent in the rear so i would't put it against the wall . i have 2 of these heaters and use both so their is a least a foot of clearance on all sides . 
reason i bought this heater was an elderly woman from our church has a double wide mobile home that is uninsulated and she was constantly cold . they had a couple of radiator type heaters for their bedrooms that kept it bearable there but the living room kitchen dining area is wide open combining all of the above and that was unbearably cold . going over reviews written , checking the stats from the manufacturer , i came to the conclusion this was the answer . it arrived earlier than scheduled and just in time for the first cold front that same night . took it down to unpack and hook up . warmed the living area quite comfortably within a half hour of hookup . went to check the next a.m. to see how it did . the answer i got was she cried so i would say you should not have a problem . 
yes . it has wheels so you can easily move it . 
i bought one which was woefully inadequate . i complained and they said they would send another . nothing happened . i am very busy and have not pursued it . my advice buy something else . i suspect it is a cheap rip off of something else . 
2 triple a batteries 
ca n't say i remember but the one i bought is heating an uninsulated area comprised of kitchen , dining area , and living room of a double wide mobile home and could actually heat the two bedrooms one on either side if they left the doors open . one of the women living there just turned 75 and has circulation problems like a lot of those of that age and she calls to thank me every couple of days for getting it for her . 
no . there 's an opening on top with which to drink through . 
hello sherry d. the packaging states that the item is bpa free . thanks for your inquiry , julie 
holes are probably small enough for most leafy blends . the problem with this product is that the infuser tube does n't extend far enough into the jar so it only works when jar is full . so it 's great for making a small amount of tea ahead of time but not so good for fruit or herbal infused waters to drink over several hours which is what i bought it for . 
mayb a mayonaise jar 
no it does n't it has a slit to drink from 
it is a lid for wide mouth mason jars ( you can even buy them with a handle ) - for drinking , water , ice tea and lemonade are great - it has an infuser to put lemon or mint leaves in for flavoring in water or tea . i love to use it for flavored water ! 
unfortunately , no . only in the wide mouth size . 
depends on if you put it in a wide mouth pint jar or a wide mouth quart jar it 's just the infuser lid dose not come with jar fits both i love this thing cut up a lemon and put in there it works great 
the lid does not have an open and close hole . however , it is designed so that it would not spill much . 
i 'm not sure . it is made of hard inflexible plastic . i guess you could , but i would look into a cuppow for hot drinks . 
hello , if you mean hot tea and coffee , yes they will work . thank you for your interest . 
yes ! i put bot the lids and the straws in my dishwasher . the straws are large , so they go well in the silverware bucket and do n't fall through . 
hi sybil . these were made in china . 
yes . i use the lid and straw for my juice drinks and ice water . i love the tops . it turns the jar into a perfect reuse able water bottle . i have never liked plastic or aluminum water bottles , so this works great for me . 
the opening is `` across the center . i 'm sure it would accommodate a fairly large straw . wherever did you get glass straws ? i want some ! 
wide mouth only . but you can also buy standard . 
yes , but disposable straws are significantly smaller than the supplied straws ( and more wasteful ! ) . 
yes 
they are pba free plastic-diswasher safe too . love them . 
they can but i would n't recommend it 
no not a bit also if i have a glass of ice water in the late evening ( 9 pm ) and the ice is still there in morning ( 6 am ) . these glasses have really good stainless steel construction . 
like it a lot but not lid . i order from greenpaxx there silicone non toxic lid cap that works well . also order there straws which also works great along side there lids . 
definitely , the edge of the cup was very smooth 
i do love the tumblers ~ however ~ they do not keep beverages hot or cold for any additional time ! additionally ~ lipstick is extremely difficult to remove ! 
ive had these cups for about a year and they are my favorite mug . i will say that the covers do have an odor to them for a few weeks . i washed mine several times to get rid of the smell . it did take several washings but it did go away my mugs are solid stainless steel inside and out . they must be referring to the cover , it did have an odor . the mug looks like it did the day i purchased brand new . im glad i got this response because i plan to purchase a few more . i checked a month or 2 ago and they were not available . 
no ... the inside of this cup is the same as the outside . stainless steel all around 
as it states in the product description , it is indeed 6 1 2 '' tall . 
yes . it keeps a cup of coffee hot for about 20-30 min . the lid is the shortcoming . it 's silicone so it smells plasticy and is n't that secure - not like a screwed on top . it works . 
no 
it 's 6.25 inche 's tall , not dishwasher compatible stainless steel and the lid is smelly silicone . it does however keep coffee very hot for plenty of time to drink entire cup hot to the last drop 
you screw two screws into the wall and the board slides over the screws . it comes with a paper mounting template , the screws and spacers so you know how far to screw the screws into the wall . it 's really easy . 
it is a continuos magnetic field . you do not have to search for the magnets . 
how does wood scratch metal ? this is a wonderful product for matching kitchen dcor . g 
i used and recommend anchors in drywall . the included ones that came with the block were nice beefy ones and i used them . i have to think screws alone into drywall would work loose over time . if you have any wobble after the install you could tighten the screws a bit more into the anchors until the final install is flush and firm to the wall . this mounts by slots on the back of the block sliding onto the screw heads so you control how tight the install is to the wall . 
people have used 3m extreme mounting tape http : www.amazon.com scotch-414-dc-extreme-mounting dp b009np1jqc ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1431543018 & sr=8-1 & keywords=3m+extreme+mounting+tape 
without having cut one but looking at the veneer job , i would guess not unless you can hide the cut end and do not splinter the veneer . also you would have to be careful not to cut into the magnets inside . the hangers are very nicely finished and it would be a shame to cut something so expensive . and they do work good , but my wife would not let me hang up the knives on the kitchen wall like i was planning - she said it looked like a kitchen from texas chain saw massacre . 
the distance from center to center of the keyhole mounts is 10 '' , and 1 '' from the edges . 
they are very strong , it is difficult to remove them actually . but they are made for a stable kitchen environment . 
you could try and use some heavy duty double sided tape , or glue it to the fridge with heavy duty glue . down side is will it hold the weight of your knives ? also what happens when the fridge breaks down do you loose the wood with it ? things to think about . 
it goes the full length 
yes , it is safe to leave this unit on all day , as far as i know . i have left mine on for a couple of days , and only turned it off to see if it actually collected more than a few drops of water . i find this unit ineffective . perhaps i have a lemon , and while it does not overheat , it also does not remove much humidity . 
a 10x10 room should do well with this i did get quite a bit of moisture out of the room which has bigger dimension but had to run it a long time , and it was n't the most quiet thing . i did like the removable water dish which i used to water plants 
this unit is adequate for a small room only -- -do n't get if you want it for a large room -- -get a unit for a large room . since it is a cheap unit , i hardly think it would filter air -- -i am sorry now that i ordered it ... ... ... .. 
my first suggestion would be to go with one of their more powerful models , but if you do n't want to spend more , i would say that this will bring it down a few notches , but the larger the space , the more dilute it 's effects will be . it will still pull the moisture out , but it may not be powerful enough to bring it down more than a few % . and it 's also going to depend on air circulation . if the air does n't circulate , it will bring it down in the area where it 's located , but not in the entire space . 
no , we have it in bathroom , run it 24 7 year round ( freezing winter weather at times ! ! ) another in a bedroom ! ! 
filter free . or it has a filter built in that does n't need replacing . i 'm not sure . the only thing that can be opened accessed is the water reservoir . the instruction manual does n't mention a filter . it 's a very simple design . that is not to say the technology is simple ... 
one year 
i do not recall there being a hose option on this small de-humidifier . i found it insufficient so i re-boxed my de-humifier & stored it in my storage locker . 
the relationship between wattage and cubic feet ( on an x y axis ) is not linear . meaning one more watt of power will not increase the cubic foot coverage by an equal increment . 
i would say yes - it does warm up a small bathroom ( but not a large florida room ) ... and i would never leave it unattended . that being said ... does amazing job of dehumidifying these rooms for such a small unit ! 
yes , it 's a mechanical power switch not digital so it resumes after restored power . 
no . it just stops when the container is full . i wouldnt honestly waste money on this product again . we use it in less than 400sqft ( a 34ft travel trailer ) and it 's not enough . yet it takes 12 days to fill the tiny container . it 's not super efficient . 
nope , i run it in my small bathroom with no noticeable effect in temperature from this running all day long . it really keeps the area dry though ! 
you should be able to pull it back out . maybe fish it out with a pair of tweezers ? 
no , it is a 110v appliance . 
i have never heard of this before and think it would be a defeating action in both cases and a waste of energy . there are food drying machines on the market and i have even heard of drying food on screens in the sun or in the oven . 
yes . i use one in the bathroom but i also use a fan during the shower . it takes time to work but it does remove a lot of moisture from the air . 
i do n't see how you could . the tank is adequate in size and dumping it is very easy . you would n't really need to have it drain automatically . 
ac power only . no battery option . 
no 
yes ... the bags are in the kenmore box . the filters are sealed in plastic bags . 
i 'm sorry , i ca n't answer the question . i do n't know . i bought kenmore o bags for the kenmore progressive . 
sure is , works perfectly . 
i 've measured it flat and it came out 6 '' wide by 17 1 2 '' long . the canadian part number is : 20-50510 and us part number is 20-50690. it 's the exact same box of 2 you 'd find in a sears store . 
this are two cushions . 
we have a light beige color of cushion as an option . please , contact us directly and i will send you a picture . thanks 
i think the easiest way to explain it is that each chair is 26 '' wide from arm to arm . you can measure that easily to your table . lovely chairs by the way ! 
my chairs came with a table . put rattan ottoman in google . i bet you can find one there ! 
i do n't know i bought the chair to be in a office . 
dimensions of the seat and the cushion is 20 '' w and 22 '' d . 
dimensions of this chair are 29'h x 25 '' d x 26 '' w 
not as fizzy if you do n't refrigerate . 
really ? 
we had to return this inferior product . it continually leaked . we got a soda stream instead . 
yes , one cartridge . fortunately you can buy them in bulk here . 
14 pieces . 
greetings robert : the box also shows a 3 3 4 '' paring knife and protective blade cover is included which would account for the 14 pieces . we hope to serve you soon ! blumonga trading 
there are 14 pieces in this set . http : ecx.images-amazon.com images i 31a7zm25rol._sl500_ss100_.jpg please see the secondary picture - ( we have no control over how amazon displays these pictures ) . there is a bonus paring knife with sheath .

black felt and the hinges inside are covered with felt also so you ca n't see them . my daughter just loves it to store her school books and computer in . college books are so big but this is perfect size for that . 
thank you for your inquiry . this item is only available in the dark brown pictured . 
yes its a dark brown almost blk . the top of it is smooth . 
the bench has a matte finish . there is a sheen but not glossy like patent leather . 
some of the reviews mention some big people using it as a bench . seems decently sturdy but i would n't use it as a trampoline . we 've had maybe total 250 worth of people on it with no issues . i 'm sure it would take more .

13inches 
as long as the blankets are not real thick . maybe 3 pillows and 2 blankets . nice for the $ $ . 
no , is not required any assembly . 
its quit frim not took soft but comfortable 
i do n't have the exact weight since i got this about a year ago , but it came in two boxes , one about 120 lbs and the second about 80 lbs . 
it is faux leather , but not sure of the exact fabric name . 
hello , thanks for your question . according to the information in the product description section of the product page , the left end reclining chaise lounge is included in this set . if you 'd like to confirm this directly with one of the sellers , you can go to their storefront page and click on `` contact the seller '' which you 'll find in the bottom right corner of the page . have a great day ! 
they are flexible . if you look in the product photos , you will see a photo where both hands are balled up in `` thumbs up '' fists . there are a lot of silicone mitts you can not do that way , but you can do our super flex silicone oven mitts like that . we can do that because most of the mitt is designed to be thin enough to be really flexible . there are thicker raised areas ( the circle and spokes ) spread out in the main palm and thumb areas . these thicker raised areas are what normally make contact with the hot surfaces of pots and pans . but even the areas without the raised areas give really good heat resistance . silicone is really that good at insulating . add in the quilted comfort lining , and you have even more heat resistance . hope that helps ! : ) 
russell , this is ken at the help desk . my hand is quite large . my width is 4.75 '' and the thickness is 2.25 '' . they slip on fairly easy for me , though i think a larger hand would have problems . measure your hand width and thickness just below the thumb joint , and see if yours is larger than my hand . length really is not a problem . hope that helps . 
thanks for asking . the outside length from the tip to the cuff is 11 5 8 '' long . there is no extended cuff . the mitt does normally extend at least 2.5 '' past the wrist , though , so it does offer protection for the wrist area . how big hand will it fit ? it will fit hands up to 2.5 '' thick ( measuring the thickness of the palm at the thumb ) and 4.75 '' wide ( measuring the width of the hand where the thumb connects to the rest of the hand ) . so , it will fit a fairly large hand . a hand that is 2.5 '' thick and 4.75 '' width will be snug in the mitts , but can still work comfortably . i hope all that helps . : ) let us know if you have any additional questions . 
this is ken over at nurturing planet . i can not say for sure that you will find the mitts perfect for you . i have had a very few ladies with very small hands say that they love the mitts , but that they find them unwieldy , and have returned them . i would say that if anyone else will use them besides you , then you will find them a very good compromise for a `` multiple person '' kitchen . i would suggest you try them . returns are not a problem , and you can get all your money back if they just do n't work well for you . looking forward to your decision . : ) 
you can not detach the liner , but it can be pulled inside out . my recommendation is , if you get bbque sauce in it or something , to do the following . reach inside and grab the very end of the liner between 2 fingers , while pushing in the mitt from the top so that the liner will be easier to grab . in one swift motion , pull the liner completely inside out . then pull the thumb area out from the rest of the liner . hang over the edge of the sink and wash the liner with whatever soap you want to . take care to not get water into the inside of the mitt itself , to speed drying . dish soap is actually fine because it will cut any grease better . rinse thoroughly under the faucet to remove the soap . then either lay on the counter to dry or hang on a clothes line . let it dry so you feel no dampness in the liner . then carefully stuff the liner back into the silicone shell . hope that helps ! - ken , nurturing planet awesome support

yes ! i normally bake roasts at 500 f for a short period of time and have never had a problem when i 've had to take the roast out to check it -- while at the 500 degree temp . hope this helps . all i can tell you is that they are by far and away the best mitts i 've ever used -- and i 've been cooking and baking for decades ! ! ! : ) 
the brush is an extra bonus , and yes , it is a gift . is n't that nice ! i have found it very useful for basting on the grill . i like that it cleans up easily as well . 
should n't be a problem . the lining is pretty thick . they are really good mitts . 
no these do not have any logos , and if it 's a nice work towel you will love these ! i keep a wicker basket under my isle and toss these in when i have finished using them and since their are so many you can use a new one every use or every day . the clean up is wonderful for drying clear glass and not leaving streaks . plus they make me feel like i am in my french kitchen ! love ! 
we recommend washing in warm or hot water and drying in low heat . if these care instructions are followed , the towels usually shrink up to 1-2 inches ( to anywhere between 13 '' x 23 '' to 14 '' x 24 '' ) . these towels are 100 % cotton and they are expected to shrink a little . as they shrink a little after a few washes the threads should become more tightly woven , resulting in a more absorbent lint-free towel . if you dry the towels in high heat , you should expect a little more shrinking ( up to 3 '' ) , to about 13 '' in width by 21 '' -22 '' in length . some of our customers like to keep their towels in the best shape and dry them in low heat , while some customers like the convenience of drying all linens together in high heat and do n't mind the additional shrinking . i hope this helps . lisa liliane collection 
no hanging loop . 
no . these towels have gone through lots of use and laundering and are holding up beautifully . however-i dry them on my drying rack to prevent more shrinking . since i have 13 towels , i do n't miss the 3 or 4 that are drying . 
fabric softener adds a layer of 'water repellency ' to fabrics , giving them a softer hand . you 're really not supposed to add fabric softener to your bath towels as it diminished their absorbency -- -but who wants to dry off with sandpaper ? for the first wash , i washed mine in the hottest water , with just laundry soap -- nothing else , and subsequent washings were just done the way i do all my laundry : with a scoop of oxy and the downey ball . they work perfectly . 
yes . they will be much softer and more absorbent if you do , and become nicer with each washing . they bleach beautifully . 
yes they do - i have granite counters , and often use these towels when cleaning them . 
i did not look . i will now.. it states bangladesh ... . they are awesome.. i have had them for several months now.. i bought several sets.. they get wet and dirty fast , so having several make it nice.. 
i am not sure about that because i have never used flour sack towels before , but i can tell you that if you follow the care instructions , they are the best kitchen towels i have ever had . they are absorbent and they take to being bleached really well . i bought this set and then purchased the bigger version . hope this helps . 
yes , these towels are thin yet absorbent , nothing ventured ... nothing gained 
60hz . 
sorry for that happening to you . i ca n't remember but i do n't think mine arrived that way . you may have gotten a machine that someone was actually using thus the grinds all over the place . i 'd phone the company you bought it from and the rancillio company . 
5 and 7 8 '' with the grind catcher removed . 
i confess i have cleaned mine only once in the last 3 years and only then when it got gummed up and the motor stopped . it is n't particularly hard to disassemble , clean , reassemble and recalibrate the burrs . also , the burrs are replaceable if they become worn . there are a number of youtube videos showing how it 's done . take a look at a few of them and see if you would be comfortable doing the work yourself . 
hi leo , i have n't used my moka with it yet , but i would guess that 12-13 ( untamped ) would be about right for most roasts . 
depending on your preference , roast , and beans used , i 'd say around 25 seconds . it does not have a grind timer , so you get to stand there with your finger on the button and let the noise , aroma , and anticipation carry you away ! 
the aeropress will not fit directly below , you would have to hold it at an angle and therefore not hands free . 
no , the hopper is not removable . we have taken to putting just enough beans into the hopper to make a single cup , so we can switch beans ( say , to make a decaf or have a different espresso ) . would be nice , but no . 
it works fine for coarse grinds . we do both fine and much less fine for coffee maker . 
i 've used it only on 110 v. i believe the burrs are conical . they also sell replacement burrs . i 've used it exclusively for espresso grind . it works very well and easily gets fine enough . 
a tamper , the ss drain pan , under overflow pan , the water container , the water container cover , the coffee basket ( handle ) and 2 coffee grind interior cups . ( one for single shots and the larger cup for double shots ) it 's a real good non-auto espresso machine . it 's even good enough for small restaurants 
there is space for the mug if you remove the tray . 
yes , it does much to our chagrin . the tank is food grade plastic and the tubes are silicon . we use it anyway , because it has so many other components that do not have plastic or aluminum . it makes great coffee ! we use spring water in the tank , and figure it 's getting heated in the brass boiler , so at least it 's not a lot of leaching ... .after looking into so many coffee makers , this one won over the rest . my husband wants to make a stainless steel or copper lining for the tank . hope this is helpful . 
i just called rancilio to find out because we had the same question . ( i looked on their website , under 'world-wide branch locations ' . i called the u.s. office in woodridge , il . ) the woman said that all machines being sold anywhere are v3 , or as she said , `` the latest model '' . she also recommended two businesses nearer to our home that sell them with free shipping ... and she recommended that we look to see if places offer extended warranties . some do and others do not . ) hope this helps ! it may be worth a call to them to see if there are locations near where you live . 
before you spend to replace parts , try to fix it yourself . unscrew the top and take it off so you can see inside . you will have to lift out the water container to get the top off so you can look into it . ( after unplugging it , of course ! ) there are three thermostats , two on the top and one on the side of the boiler . locate the side one , there is a red button on the top of this thermostat . press this button . you may not hear a thing , but do it anyway . now replace the top , plug in and see if it works . this is a reset button -- the boiler may have overheated . if it does n't work , at least you tried ! then you can looks for somewhere to spend your money trying to get it fixed . will rancilio do anything for you as far as repairs ? one other thing i should mention , if it is heating ( feels warm on top on the lid when you touch it ) , but no water comes out , you may have to prime it . fill with water , make sure both plastic tubes are to the bottom of the water container , turn on the middle switch of the three on the left , then turn on steam wand handle counter clockwise , now turn on power . ( main switch ) in about 15 seconds a stream of water should come out of the wand , so have a glass under there ! now it 's ready to be used again . 
hsd is the new model it 's the same with very small difference , you ca n't go wrong with either one , specially if the price is to high.ps must buy a good grinder ! sc 
the speed of the water and intensity of the coffee are controlled `` the old fashioned way '' by adjusting 2 things , grind and tamp pressure . the art of using a real machine like this is that over time you come to understand how roast , grind ( with a real burr grinder ! ! ) and tamping pressure control and shape your coffee . i suggest you watch videos from seattle coffee works on you tube and you will being your apprenticeship ! ! 
your more then likely packing your coffee too full ? 
3 pin . 110v 
no 
there is none after 30 days . mine broke after 3 months . have not been able to find someone who can fix it . 
95 to 185 and no you ca n't use it without heat . 
hi , it has 10 trays and the tray 's are chrome-plated with stainless steel and the whole thing are stainless steel . 
super q dehydrator model : pt-40 
yes , the trays are metal , it is a nice set up . donna 
i 'm not sure as we sent it to a rear shop to be fixed.it never worked but 2 hours.we were very unhappy with amazon and the people it came from.this was a christmas gift that did n't work and to expensive . to be treated so bad they did n't stand behind their product 
i bought it and have n't used it yet . it 's a replacement for another type that burned up in a fire . i will not have another plastic one though as i found them hard to clean and not as durable . 
dehydrator outside dimensions : 17 '' w x 20.5 '' d x15.5 '' h ; 10 trays : each 16 '' w x 14.5 '' d ( 2320 sq . inches total drying space vice advertised 2400 . ) 
yes the are and they are made very sturdy . very easy to clean i am very pleased with mine . mitch 
it is made in china 
you only need one hand to pump the plunger up and down , but you need to somehow hold the bottle steady - maybe holding it with your arm against your body , or maybe between your knees ? 
the needle is sturdy . it is a significantly wider diameter than a sewing needle . and it requires almost as much force as that needed to twist a corkscrew . but easier to do because you 're just pushing it straight down . hope this helps ! 
for no earthly reason . this opener works on any color or bottle size . maybe they want you to buy two , one for red and one for white ? 
just pump 
yes , you do remove the cork from the needle . there is a plastic disk that you push on so you do n't have to touch the cork or needle . it took me a minute to figure that out , but it does slide off easily once you get it . 
yes . as long as you 're able to hold the bottle steady with one hand , you can pump the bottle opener with the other hand . 
thank you for the question . we would recommend a 8 year old not to use this product because it has a long teflon needle . but it is very easy to use . it only requires 3-4 pumps and the cork pops out ! 
hello . this is not a co2 it 's a hand pump it uses air . 
there is a clear circular ring above the needle , so when the cork is removed , just gently press the plastic ring down and that pushes the cork off of the needle . easy as it comes . 
the purpose of using a silicone mat is one of health . aluminum , when heated , leaches into the food . metals like al have been strongly linked to alzheimers and other diseases . one should not use al cookware , al foil , etc . unless there is a barrier between the al and the food . even when cooking in al foil 'wraps ' , one should put a layer of parchment paper on top of the al foil , folding the parchment around the food and then folding the foil . not a stupid question ; hopefully you do n't think it 's a stupid answer ( coming from a biochemist ) . 
this is a little thin for a trivet . it would get hot on the table below it if you put a real hot pan on it . that being said , i have used it for a trivet by folding it in half and it worked good ! test it first to be safe . i hope that answered it a little bit : ) 
yes , yes , and no : ) it is a special fda approved food-grade silicone raw material , which is bpa free ! no fiberglass so you can cut it to size if you want ! thanks for the great questions ! 
yes it is ! ! and the mat has a very nice thickness and is so supple : ) 
absolutely sarah ! i have used it many times for cheesy breads and it works perfectly ! ! many mats do not go to the temperatures this mat can go to so have fun : ) 
it is 45 x 30 cm or about 17 3 4 x 11 3 4 inches ! 
hello ana ! it depends on the cookie sheet you have ! mine is a little bigger and just comes up and over the sides . most cookie sheets are a little bigger , so they fit perfectly . it does n't matter if it is a little big ! enjoy ! 
this mat is very durable and supple at 1.1mm thick : ) 
the seller 'in print ' said you can cut the mat to size . i should think cutting should not void the warranty . 
you can cut it down to size a toaster oven . i had a different one that i put in the toaster oven that caught on fire because i did n't cut it down . lesson learned . i 've never used it in a microwave , but i believe silicone can be microwaved . 
i think most are good up to 500. you can not put them on a burner or under a broiler . some you can put in a microwave . 
it holds 8 cups 
just to make sure . spray a lil bit of pam . would be enough ! great product ! ! ! 
i have n't tried but i do n't see why not . it 's pretty sturdy 
i just hand washed it . 
it holds 8 cups . 
my silicone bundt pan works perfect , please note that you have to take your cake out of pan only when it is not hot anymore ... aproximately after 30 minutes otherwise it can `` slouch '' down . so if you bake it for 30 minutes , then let it cool in open oven , if you put cake from the oven into cold place it definitely will `` slouch '' down because difference of temperatures . it is especially important for sponge cakes and alike ... 
it 's about 8 inches across , and maybe 5 inches high . these are just guesses . 
yes , so far as i know all silicone bakeware is microwave safe . 
3 
there are no markings on the scoops , but i did a liquid test with them . the small one is approximately 2 tablespoons , the middle one is approximately 3 tablespoons , and the large one is approximately 5 tablespoons . 
there are no marks on these to identify the place they were made , sorry . 
there are no numbers . sorry . 
i believe so . i love this set of scoops , i use mine all the time , especially for cookie dough , muffins , cup cakes . pancakes etc . it is a really good set . 
about an inch , maybe a little more 
yes , they are . 
it can be used to fold towels ... but i would look elsewhere . very flimsy construction which does not hold up with regular use 
it sure does ! it will work on anything . if you 're using adult clothes and the bottom of the shirt is longer than the folder , just fold that up until it 's even . but , with kids clothes , you 'll never have that problem . this is a great way to fold when you 're limited on space . since everything folds to the same size , you can store more in less space . good luck ! : ) 
plastic . poly propelyne and poly ethelyn 
it 's good ! i 've been using mine for a couple of months now . it 's showing no signs of falling apart . 
i do n't recall getting clothes pins with mine . sorry i ca n't help . i 'd pay close attention to where this is manufactured - that could give a clue . 
no just depth 
the folded dimensions is 22cmx28.5cm , thanks . 
yes ! i fold xxl shirts on it all the time ! it can fold any size shirt ! 
you can fold anything on it ! i use it to fold sheets , pants , shirts , towels ... .you name it , it folds it ! 
absolutely ! i use the largest of the three for this purpose regularly . 
it does n't say and i threw out the package it came in . it only had a small sticker on the handle . maybe if you click on northern lights usa inc they can tell you where it 's made . they 're the ones it 's sold by ! 
no , the mesh is the same 'grade ' on all three ... i would say that it 's on the fine side , but not super fine . super helpful , right ? : ) 
they fit in the top of a wide mouth jar but there is a small gap so i have found if you pour slowly it prevents anything from getting around the strainer . also the small fits perfect on the smaller mouthed jars and jelly jars . 
it is very fine mesh , i use when i make soup and it strains everything out but the broth . 
these are good quality , very sturdy & very well priced . definnetly recommend 
i 've done it - so i guess it 's safe to do . i think it would depend upon how long you hold the strainer over boiling water . it 's stainless steel so i think it would hold up for time to steam your vegetables . these are my favorite strainers and i use them for so much ! probably more than they were intended for ! give it a go - try it with a small one first just to check it out . have fun ! ( i love steamed vegetables , too ! ) 
just a single layer 
the largest one has a depth of about 1-3 4 inch , the middle one about 1-1 4 inch , and the smallest one about 3 4 inch . these are approximate as there is no way to measure without a depth gauge . they are relatively shallow , but extremely well made and serviceable . the mesh is fine enough for me to use it for sifting small seeds and flour . i would buy them again , if i needed to replace them . 
the mesh part is about 2 inches across . 
http : youtu.be ll4qkt4jz00 this will help to explain some differences on video , also dc40it is easy to empty out the vacuum 's canister . the roller ball makes this machine easy to maneuver while limiting what the vacuum can go under like couches and beds . the dc40 lets you turn off the brush bar when you are vacuuming hardwood floors . there are complaints that the dc40 has a high pitched whine , though it is quieter than competing vacuums . cons the dc40 's cord length is only 25 feet . the dc41 's cord goes an extra ten feet . you may end up unplugging and plugging back in the dc40 as you clean a room . its bin only holds 0.42 gallons of dirt and debris . if you are cleaning a dirty room , you may have to empty it more than once . the bin does n't attach as securely as prior dyson vacuum versions like the dc25 . the machine has such powerful suction that it sometimes stalls on shag rugs . the dc41the dc41 is designed for people who own animals . it does a great job picking up cat and dog hair . you have to clean out the suction chamber regularly to maintain its strong suction . it is also supposed to be able to handle more types of flooring than the dc40 . this vacuum also has a wider cleaner head , so you 'll need fewer passes to clean the floor . the dc41 has a larger bin at just over half a gallon . this vacuum also has about 10 % more suction power . this vacuum has auto-leveling wheels to help it get all carpet or tile equally well . the dc41 does n't need to be adjusted when you transition from carpet to tile or hardwood floors . cons the power cord is not retractable like earlier dyson versions . and while this is the latest edition of the vacuum , it lacks the headlight earlier versions often had . the vacuum wand does n't have much reach . if you want to use the vacuum wand , you have to attach a crevice tool to the hose which adds to the time it takes to vacuum corners and crevices . and then , because the crevice tool is seven inches wide , it does n't fit into the small nooks and crannies that need to be vacuumed out the most . 
it switches from floor to rug with just the touch of a button . you 'll love it . 
long skinny tool for along woodwork , brush attachment , small flat suction tool 
yes , outstanding on carpet 
my wife and i estimate the chord is 30ft ( 10 paces ) and the coil and wand extended is 12ft 
no 
i think the 41 is a bigger machine physically than the 50. i do n't know if there is a difference in suction though . i can tell you that my dc41 has a lot more suction than my previous old dc7 and i think it does a great job . 
no 
just the mini turbine head and a hose extension in the handle for it .

2.2 hp motor 
yes 
the vitamix 750 , g series , is shorter than the original vitamix 5200 , c series , and claims to fit underneath overhead cupboards . however , it does not fit underneath my overhead cupboards ( maybe my cupboards hang down lower than other cupboards ) ; if i take the lid off it fits . it does not create a problem for me because i do have an area on my countertop without overhead cupboards . you can measure your spacing ; the unit is 17.4 '' tall . 
yes and yes ... ..just make sure you watch the dvd first ... you will be very happy that you did ... .love , love , love this machine 
not sure . 750 is the artisan series only sold by higher end kitchen stores . has better book by the actual chef and the biggest 2.2 hp motor as well as 40 % quieter than older versions . 
yes 
with a converter 110 to 220v it should work 
vitamix 750 
no 
no , is not hard , like any other blender , still you can always take the parts off and scoop from under , i recommend you the blender 100 % is my most beloved appliance in the kitchen ! : ) is not hard to scoop no worries . 
when mine arrived the knives and block were separate . once i placed the knives in the block , i had no issue getting them out . 
i bought them for 12.99 which may have been an error . they are pretty good quality for that price but not sure at 199. i use them a lot and have had no problems with them . they set kind of jumbled in the holder but still look nice and work very well . 
yes they are , i just got the set today . see my review : ) 
i dont know the quality of those other brands . but i would not think these were high enough quality for that . good luck . 
not sure where they 're made . but , if you 're concerned about the quality i can tell you it is a nice set . do n't expect the knives to match the quality of any real chef knife ( $ 500+ per ) , but if you take care of them , no dishwashers - hand wash , and sharpen now and again ... they are very nice . i am super happy with the purchase . 
the newisland replacement filters are available on amazon now . normally replace filter about every two to three months ( depending on use and local water quality ) . it can work with most type of water bottle . simply place the device on any bottles without screwing it on , still works ! hope this will help ! 
no you can not . 
the satechi ones do not work ! i thought they might and they are too thin and have a hard plastic case . i found a web site for the humidifier and will be emailing them to see if they have replacements . the product comes with 2 filters and us und distilled water i have n't had to replace yet . 
i dont think so . it sits on top of a water bottle and there is no reservoir that you can put the oils in . 
it does n't even work upright , nor does it attach securely to the bottle . just kind of props there . 
yes , when the water in the bottle is not full to the top . and one time the plastic cap that the filter goes into was not twisted all the way in . 
it 's very quiet . it is not noisy . 
it has blue light when you plug the usb cable with the computer , and it turns off if you unplug it . 
it 's cool mist . 
it is best for space under 108 square feet . any small room is ok 
it says 100 % silicone , so i assume there are no bpas . 
9 '' by 3 5 8 '' on the inside of the pan 
mine has been stable , i use regular dish soap . i do n't stick it in dishwasher 
label says china . i 've been very pleased with mine . 
there is no cover . a pullman loaf pan would have a cover , but it 's metal . if you want a cover , put a flat baking sheet on top with a weight on it . for no knead bread , you are better off using a cast iron pot with a cover or some other kind of large heavy duty pot . this loaf pan is too small for most no knead bread , and i 'm not sure if the walls get hot enough . 
i 'm not 100 % certain jello would n't stick since i 've only baked bread in it . the bread does n't stick , and the pan cleans up easily . i use mine on average 2x a week . a few of the `` tabs '' on the bottom have come off , but that does n't affect the pan part . it would make an interesting jello mold-shape ! 
it 's not as bad as others but still a bigger middle . 
yes , you can certainly make meatloaf in silicone pans . i usually do n't because the grease sinks to the bottom and it has nowhere to go . other than that , nothing sticks in the silicone and it 's so easy to clean . 
probably ! it would be a gigantic ice brick though . it holds up well against extreme temperatures . 
210 mm by 75 mm that is to about 8 by 3 inches . it is flexible pan and my measurements may be a bit off . 
china 
ice chamber is plastic , the rest of it is glass . we made a mixed drink in it and the glass was so thin it broke it a perfect circle when we were stirring the drink with a plastic spoon . not sure whether we had one defective product or if it 's an overall issue , but would not recommend the product . 
its plastic 
just under 1 foot and a quarter inch . 
yes it is removable . you can use the jar with or without it . one piece of advice . make sure if when you get this to tighten the spigot valve from inside the jar . i am very happy with this purchase . 
it unscrews from the lid . i do n't use it for my purposes . 
it is a threaded lid . i liked it a lot . i used it to make sangria . my only admonishment is to make sure that the screw behind the spigot is tightened . mine came loose which i did not find out until the sangria was in . i had to pour it out tighten the spigot and pour the sangria back in . after that it worked perfectly . 
you sure can ! 
depends on the refrig and rack adjustment . its taller than a milk bottle . 
container is glass , lid and inside ice tube are plastic . really good for the price . has lasted me 6 uses so far with no leaking . 
hi again , matt . i just found out that the omelet pan does indeed have the red removable silicone handle . i 'll update my listing and photos . regards , jamaica @ the healthy corner store 
this has edges , so rather like a rounded square . not circular like a standard skillet . 
yes , xtrema products are made in china . however , they are designed in the usa and the facility in china does everything by hand in a 3-week small batch process . 
just a follow up : there is a way to make it compatible . however , you would need a special induction disk that fits on top of the induction burner . 
no 
that 's a great question . although there are similarities , rest assured that we did not copy them . our ceramic mandoline slicer has a different design ( especially along the sides ) . it is sturdier . also , the handle is different . 
its not a chopper . it does slice very thinly . you can criss cross over the blade and get a cubing effect . 
no extra blades 
approximately 1 16 of an inch , though there is a little variance . i hope this helps . 
no , it is not . 
mine fell apart the second time i used it . 
i do n't have a ruler , but it fits beautifully inside the 4-cup mr. coffee coffee maker it is made for . i imagine it has the exact same dimensions as this other , `` no handle '' version ( http : www.amazon.com mr-coffee-permanent-include-handle dp b000wmtbd8 ref=pd_sim_k_4 ) , which a commenter said were these dimensions : `` ... 3.5 '' outer diameter upper rim ; 2 7 8 '' od bottom ( solid plastic ) ; 2 '' height ... '' 
it 's 3 1 4 '' across by 2 '' tall 
yes . that 's what i bought it for , and it works great . 
i did n't find that to be the case . 
you know i 'm not sure , i assume it is 
i have a mr coffee but it is not programmable . but i am under the impression that this filter fits most 4 cup coffee makers . 
i ca n't be certain as this was automatically recommended by amazon when i purchased the 4 cup mr. coffee machine ( model # drx5 ) . perhaps go & see if your model is available & then see what extras ( if any ) are offered ? 
i wash mine by hand , but it may be ok in the top rack of the dsihwasher . i 've never tried it . 
i could be mistaken , but it does not appear to be nylon . it has a gold color and feels metallic to me ( and it is flexible ) . hope this helps . 
yes , and i am very happy with it . easy to clean and does not create the paper waist of a standard filter . 
i would suggest looking in the booklet that came with it and calling the telephone number tats there and asking them . hope this helps . i am so pleased with my ninja cooker . 
go to this page 
i do not know if it is ptfe or pfoa free . i have not had my metal handle or edging rust . i do not have a glass lid . they do not come with a glass lid . that you would have to buy seperately and mine has been backordered since june . i would suggest hand washing everything though because i have read where people have put the rack in the dishwasher then started rusting . 
it does n't weigh as much as a ceramic pot , but make sure to empty it of food before you try to lift it . 
from 250-425 degrees 
sorry . do n't know . 
yes you can 
17 1 2 wide including handles,12 1 2 deep including controls , 10 1 2 high including lid 
no 
i do n't know 
the height of the arm is 26 inches . note that the arm is slightly higher closer to the back of the chair , where it is 27 inches . the height starts to increase at about 9 inches from the front of the arm , which is about 14 inches from the front of the front legs . 
i returned these . i took one out it was already scratched and scratched at the tiniest use . i have three boys . they 're beautiful but not for everyday use . especially children 
at least 200 pounds for sure . 
no assembly is required . 
it 's 18 '' up to the bench and 36 '' up to the back 's end . 
yes , there is a recycle logo . i knew that when i bought the chairs and i must say it was the first thing i looked for when i unpacked them . i was relieved that the logo , in my opinion , is not prevalent . it 's not something anyone would notice unless someone pointed it out to them . happy to send you photos . 
not that i know of 
yes they do stack . 
i ca n't claim to know maximum weight but if it 's any help , i had a 220lb guest sit on them without any trouble . 
i just bought two of them and they are completely clear - no tint . 
there is a sausage setting . i have done sausages once . came out perfect like everything else . 
best things about opti grill is you do n't have to worry about it- the lights and beeps will let you know . we did turkey burgers from frozen to cooked in less than 10 minutes . we did a chicken sliced in half the other day . took 37 minutes- longer since it had bones etc.- but it was the juiciest best grilled chicken i have had in a long time . the skin was golden brown- almost like fried chicken but less grease ... .i highly recommend buying this item . 
yes , they pop in and out very easily . cleaning the cooking surfaces is not a problem . 
you get the grill marks like you do on most grills . i have not noticed the top or bottom being hotter then the other so i would say it cooks well on both sides . now when you use the word `` crust '' you must be asking about its ability to sear ... that i have not seen this grill do . the only one that i know that does a great job at this is the breville http : www.amazon.com breville-bgr820xl-smart-grill dp b003sin0bc ref=sr_1_10 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1401304965 & sr=8-10 & keywords=breville 
if you put the food on the grill before it indicates it is ready to cook it will automatically switch to manual mode . i learned that the hard way . so the proper steps are : 1. power on . 2. select type of meat sandwhich . 3. press ok. ( if you are grilling frozen meat select the frozen food option , which is the snowflake button ) . 4. wait until it warms up which should be indicated by both the slow flashing doneness light on the right becoming steady and a beeping tone . 5. put your food on the grill and close the lid . you will then see the doneness light at the right turn blue . it will change color and alarm at each doneness stage . for example . when it gets to rare it will beep and the doneness light will be yellow and progress all the way to red and well done to which it will give you a different alarm continuously until you press ok. hope that helps . 
mine did that once i unplugged then ran through the steps again , power on , select food type and it started working . if you are cooking multiple items where you are pulling food off and putting more food back on the grill you have to shut the power off then power back on select food and let it go through the pre-heat stage again . hope this helps . 
oh my , yes . and better . so easy to clean . i make very fancy paninis in mine . perfect every time . 
when you here the the beep `` do do do da do '' it has preheated and you put the meat on then , it is blue while preheating but when you put the meat on it turns green and starts the cooking process . hope i helped . 
when i purchased my grill a year and a half ago i did n't get any steaks . 
the electrical cord is 46 inches long . 
after two months 
i do to ow the year but it is plenty roomy and warm.. 
yes it does and it 's a great machine . 
i use daily when i 'm not traveling and love it ! 
celsius . product book states it recommends you operate at 50 degrees celsius 
i use lysol wipes . it dries quickly . 
it 's got a year warranty . if a heating panel goes out , you have to replace it . when you bought it , there should have been a paper in it with instructions to replace . they are fast so just call and send the current one back and get a new one . 
i loved mine at first but after a few uses it caught on fire ... while i was in it . luckily i was just finishing up my session and notice the burning as i was getting out . it was a small burn but could have been much worse . i returned it . the company was a nightmare ! ! sorry i ca n't give any positive feedback . 
if all 3 parts dont work you have to return it , all 3 part must work 
yes it has a velcro on the side .u can open this flat the whole thing and i roll it to store it . 
read time is 6 to 8 seconds which is due to the reduced thickness at the tip of the probe . 
the thermometer comes with a very handy and easy to read plastic card with all the meat and poultry temperatures on it . this handy little card is attached to the plastic sheath with a silver chain . the print is easy to read unlike thermometers that have the temperature printed on the sheath . if you did not receive a temperature chart please contact us and it will be mailed out to you at no charge . 
yes . the instructions call it `` self-calibration . '' it instructs to put the stem into one inch of ice water and then push the cal button for 2 seconds . 
we have n't , and i would't 
the probe is just under 5 inches ( 12 cm ) long and made of stainless steel . 
yes 
made in china 
instant reads only . you do n't want to leave it in the oven or bbq while cooking . it is a great thermometer . 
i have gotten an accurate reading with only 1 2 inch of penetration . one inch is more than enough . 
for a beef medium well temperature of 165 degrees i have found that it is very accurate . i have compared to a analog thermometer and it was within 2 degrees each time . not bad for an instant read . hope this helps . 
yes 
the support weight is 300 lbs . 
hi freda , our portable folding guest bed weighs roughly 32 lbs . sincerely , sleep revolution 
not designed for wheels . it is not very heavy and so can be moved around easily . 
our queen bed only has 7 inches clearance and you need about 13 inches . we store ours in a walk-in closet . 
14 '' off the ground . seems a little lower than a regular bed . could be because the mattress is only 4 '' thick . 
all of our mattresses meet the requirements of 16 cfr part 1632 ( cigarette smoldering test ) and 16 cfr part 1633-federal flammability . our mattresses are certipur-us certified which means they are made without cfc 's , pbde , and formaldehyde . 
comfortable cant eel the springs . good bed 
yes 
24 inches 
yes . we put a queen tempurpedic on top and it fits . 
i have not used the frame with an air mattress , but i think it will most likely not work well . there are points where the support wires are welded to the outer frame . i am sure these would puncture the bed fairly quickly . if however , you placed plywood or other rigid material over the frame and then put the air mattress on top , it might work . i have wood under one of my mattresses ( to support my back and it stays in place just fine . another thing to consider is that the air mattress will slip off the frame pretty easily because it is very light . i have six of these bed frames and i use them with heavy foam mattresses , and they still slip some from time to time , despite being the weight of a standard spring mattresses . hope that helps : ) 
yes 
no 
i did not buy risers for this frame . it fit with in the rails of the bed i had which is what i wanted . however the clearance seems high enough to use under bed storage without risers . i hope this helps . 
its two frames connected with two brackets , that should be placed in the middle to hold frames together tightly.. yes frames can be used as two twins or king size.. high off the ground great storage underneath and with a good sturdy mattress box spring not needed 
yes it is , do n't know why they show double . very well made ! i am 330+ pounds , works well ! 
there are holes on this to thread a bolt through to the headboard footboard . i am not sure if it will be too high for your model headboard and foot board . the holes sit 12 3 4 inches from floor level 
innerspring 
yes . 
no , no rubber on the feet . i 'm sure you can get inexpensive `` furniture glidders '' from a place like home depot or walmart to place on them . we have carpeting , so it does n't do any damage . 
i really am not sure because i did not put them on yet as i do not have a headboard to use . but i would say , wait until you have a head board , and line it up on the back and make the call on where to put the braces to make sure you get an exact fit on the headboard . 
i did and it worked fine . daughter brought friends home for an extended visit and i set up the den with air mattress on frame . worked ! 
the full size includes 2 bed frame pieces each measuring 27 & # 8243 ; x 75 & # 8243 ; 
we have been using it as my daughter 's bed for several months . she is 15 , and it has been fine . very sturdy . 
just like the photo - 2 frames clipped together for all sizes except the twin 
absolutely . however , keep in mind that this already brings the bed 13 '' off the ground -- which is twice as high as a traditional frame . so with a typical 9 '' box spring your mattress will start at around 22 '' off the floor . a typical mattress is anywhere from 6-18 '' so you could end up with a very high bed . 
this frame is designed to be used as a frame , platform , and box spring without needing any additional support . 
yes 
yes 
surprisingly no , very soft and comfortable . does fray around the edges . 
i 've had mine for several months now ... i use it as a cover on my love seat for my dogs to lay on . i wash it every week . it just seems to get softer ! 
this blanket would be perfect for that use , and is actually what i use mine for now ; to protect a leather couch form pets and kids . also , this is probably the softest blanket i have ever owned . 
i 'm the person that said it knots up when it gets washed . it will knot up more and more as you wash it ; it would probably take 5 to 10 washings to be totally knotted up . once it is knotted up it loses that super soft rabbit-hair softness i like . pill is when it knots up ; so yes it pills if you wash it . it does not shed . 
mine operates on 4 `` aa '' not `` d '' cells . 
total height is 32 3 4 inches . i have to add that this trash can came without a dent or a scratch , and it works perfectly . i would buy it again . 
no 
bought for my mom in chicago an she said its to beautiful for garbage 
it will hold a few 1 gallon milk jugs , but the pizza boxes would have to be folded up , if they are for , say , a 16 '' large pie . i burn my cardboard and use half gallon waxed cardboard milk containers , and burn them also . 
queen comforter measures 86 '' x 90 '' 
no 
yes , the shams are reversible : yellow on one side , chevron print on the other side . 
bedspread , fitted sheet , flat sheet , 2 pillow cases , 2 pillow shams 
comforter ( 76 '' x 86 '' ) , two shams ( 20 '' x 26 '' ) , flat sheet ( 81 '' x 96 '' ) , fitted sheet ( 54 '' x 75 '' x 12 '' pocket ) and two pillowcases ( 20 '' x 26 '' ) 
white with coral polka dots 
the front of the sham are the exact pattern as the bed spread and the back are a bright yellow the same as the reverse side of the comforter 
good question . it is okay to fill the cups 1 4 or 1 2 full , or even leave them empty . you will not hurt the product in any way . happy baking . 
recipes will be sent to you automatically in email . you will receive 4 emails starting about 7 days after your purchase . if it has been more than 7 days , then check your spam junk mail folder . you can also check your amazon account for messages and it will be in there . if you contact the supplier through amazon , they can respond to you that way as well . the recipes are great ! ! ! good luck ! 
yes . that is primarily why i bought mine . i have frozen homemade veggie broth , spaghetti sauce , sloppy joes just to name a few . makes it very easy to pop them out and store in a freezer bag ! 
outside dimension is 1 17 16 '' or just short of 2 '' 
it 's silicone , so yes , it 's flexible bends . 
i do , it 's easier to pop them out . 
testing for `` white steaks '' is not a valid test . over 90 % of the earth 's crust is composed of silicate minerals , making silicon the second most abundant element in the earth 's crust ( about 28 % by mass ) after oxygen . [ nave , r. abundances of the elements in the earth 's crust , georgia state university ] . silicone in its natural pure form is white silver light gray , but can have traces of other colors . if you google around , you can verify this . i would put a link here , but amazon does not allow links outside of their website domain . if you see white ( or could be light gray or silver ) when you contort ( severely twist ) any silicone product , you are just seeing the raw materials used in the product , which is a good thing . 
12.9 x 9.9 x 1.5 inches 
i 'm sure you could , i have not tried , but i ca n't think of any reason they would n't work . 
there should be a link , a website , or simply the product company on the cardboard wrapper . check the back , too . go to the website and look for a way to register products . 
i believe that we bought the 2.5 l. that is enough for a family in one sitting . works well . 
there is no plastic in contact with water on the inside of the samovar . everything that is in contact is either tempered glass or stainless steel . i hope that helps ! 
it depends on the type of tea pot . if you take a look at one of the pictures posted , the lid of the samovar has a dip in it . the dip measures approximately to 3.5 inches . if the teapot you would like to use has a bottom that is less than that size than it should work . i hope that helps ! 
the lid for the samovar where the teapots sits has a dip that fits the bottom of the tea pot exactly . the bottom of the teapot is designed to sit nicely into the dip on the lid . i hope that makes sense . please let me know if you have any further questions . 
i wrote to the company - they say it is stainless steel 
i hope that crock-pot will see fit to offer the inserts for this model . i chose this model because reviews were better regarding it not leaking , and i like the power base idea ( i have an electric kettle that has a similar power base ) . please , crock-pot , start offering inserts for this model , so users can prepare multiple meals on the weekend , and tote the inserts to work . thank you ! 
no . 
it will warm food that is frozen . personally i have never warmed frozen chilli . i would give it about 3hrs and see how that goes 
this unit features an integrated carry handle so we do not have a travel bag for this model . 
yes 
it 's relatively quick between and hour to an hour and a half . i 've left food in there as long as 4 hrs and it did n't do any more than warm the food . it really is handy 
standard usa 
50w 
i 'm not sure , it 's on my desk at work , but i think it 's about 20 inches . 
just 110v . 
i got this awhile ago , but i do n't think there were directions . it 's just got the one button , so they 're not really necessary . 
yes both tools are included ! this is an excellent crepe maker . 
no 
yes 
no . but it is a great little unit . instructions states to cook crepes on setting seven . five works better for us . hope this helps . 
do n't know the one you 're asking about , but this one works fine for me~~ 
wood is . 
under the image is the same product just different brand and price . greetings 
i do n't think i would use it commercially , it 's small compared to the crepe makers i 've seen in restaurants . it works great though ! definitely not `` fast '' if that 's what you 're looking for . 
yes it does , and it 's twice as good as the ones i paid twice as much money for , excellent product . 
i did n't use any special sized peppercorns . i think you can actually adjust the grinder , but i have n't found that necessary . i use it just about every day and i love it . 
made in taiwan 
just one . i am using mine for pepper ... 
you can adjust the courseness but beware the plastic housing that holds everything together cracked in multiple places 
yes it does . i did n't mention in my review that it has a nice shape that makes it easy to hold and use . 
i have no problem what so ever.i love my mill grinder 
no 
yes 
6 aa but they seem to be lasting quite a bit and we use them all of the time 
yes . 
7.6 inch x 5.5 inch x 0.5 inch 
it uses lithium cr2032 3v battery . it is small , light and lasts for a long time . one battery is included so you do n't have to buy the battery for a while . just remember to take the plastic piece behind the battery to active it . you can get 5 batteries for less than $ 3 on amazon with free shipping or 2 batteries for around $ 2.2 with free shipping ( no minimum purchase required for either option . ) thank you ! 
press button on back of scale 
hi , thanks for your question . we would personally recommend the size # 2 or size # 4 melitta natural brown cone coffee filters . however , you can also find them at any larger retailer including target which offers their market pantry brand . hope this is helpful ! 
hi , thanks for your question . the diameter of the base measures 4 inches wide . 
hi dfrandan , thanks for your question . the dripper is designed in the us and manufactured in china . 
hi deemom , thanks for your question . unfortunately , this listing only permits amazon prime purchases in the us . we 'd have to create a separate listing for amazon prime canada specific orders . feel free to reach out to us directly via our website at neecoffee [ dot ] com and we can handle your order separately . thanks ! 
i never took the chance to get the temperature . but it only gets the milk warm and not hot as opposed to using a steam wand . i returned this machine and got me the gaggia classic . ca n't beat fresh made coffee . 
yes , that 's how it 's supposed to work . i assume there 's a compressor inside that makes the noise 
china 
it is only set for 120v 60 cycle power as far as the unit i purchased . i am not aware of a 220v unit . 
unfortunately k-cups are n't compatible with the nespresso machine . 
i have only used regular whole milk , with that said i would think it would work fine . 
yes it works great 
no 
typically with a variety pack . 
mine is set up for us use only 
the vacuum comes with its own permanent filter . dyson suggests that you clean the filter regularly for optimal service . for reference i have attached a youtube clip from their official channel describing how you clean it : http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=cjlbad_jwv0 i hope this helps , if you have any questions or need any further information , please do not hesitate to contact us directly . 
it is very light , i have a hard time lifting much of anything , and this is much lighter than the dc25 it replaced . i hope this helped . 
the box is 24 in x 10.5 in x 10 in and it weighs about 15 pounds . 
i use it to vacuum up cat litter and cat food , and the i use in the kitchen . do n't know about grouting between tiles , do n't have any flooring like that . but i think it would work just fine . the main vacuum head is very good about adapting to various floor types . 
there are two attachment holders so if you have more than 2 attachments then no 
the dc50 comes with two attachments a small hard floor attachment and a skinny attachment . the vacuum weighs 12 lbs 5.44kg 
i have 2 dyson milti floor plus compact vacuums for each level of my home . i have a variety of flooring including hand scraped wood , carpet and stone . the dyson is great on each surface . i 'm amazed at how much pet hair my old vacs were not picking up ! if you have pets , this dyson is excellent ! i have 4 long hair cats and a lab plus 2 teens and husband and the dyson cleans all their messes ! 
absolutely . the collection bin is a little small , so if you have a lot of hair to pick up , you will be emptying the bin frequently . otherwise , this is a spectacular vacuum . it cleans better , and maneuvers better than any other on the market . 
i bought this model for its light weight . the suction power easily picks up the hair of our dog and two cats . very satisfied . 
yes it is but the bottom where the legs are are not 
i 've spilled stuff on it and wiped it up i would not recommend for outside if that 's why you were asking 
not completely , how it 's showed right now is how close it would be to vertical . and yes it is at a slight angle . 
do n't worry about that , i would not purchase this it has about 5 rips in it already and ive only had it a few months , the first rip started after one month . i hope this helps but i give this futon a -1. i hope this has helped 
there is an opening , but this futon in very comfortable to sit on . as of yet we have not needed it for sleeping , but i have lad down on it and it feels firm but good . 
yes i did . it was very uncomfortable and it ripped at the seams that were stitched 
about 12 '' off the ground 
hello , that 's a great question . according to the information available on a supplier 's website , the dimensions are as follows : 69 '' l x 30.5 '' w x 29 '' h i hope this is helpful ! 
no odor that i can detect . 
the same as a regular twin bed . i use those fitted sheets for it and they fit fine . 
dry flour will not work . you can use a wet batter . this device is a tiny convection oven . it will not change the outside coating like frying in `` wet '' deep frying oil . 
i doubt it , however the recipe book that comes with it has vanilla souffle ; chicken tenders ( breadcrumb ) and croquettes . the point is these dishes that need flour required premix of oil with the coating prior to air fry . i tried the croquettes and it was kind of dry . the only way is to dip the croquette in oil or brush it heavily with oil to make it crispy . anything with flour coating seems a challenge here . i am very happy with fried chickens ( no coating ) as the skins are always crispy ! 
no , it is not as efficient as a convection oven , it does n't even `` fry '' food evenly 
i have never seen the older model , but the accessories that go inside are the same for both models available in the us , so i would guess they are about the same size . i believe the bigger model is sold in europe , but is not available here yet . i have a family of 4 and the capacity in this air fryer fits our needs just fine . we use ours every day ( ca n't imagine a bigger one ) . 
i was wondering the same thing so i searched the reviews . i discovered this in d. greenbaum `` doctordave '' 's review on march 19 , 2014 : `` crisping up some tofu was amazing . '' that pretty much sold me ! 
sim possivel . a minha esta no brasil . mas ela no tem conversao para celsius .

120v 60hz 1425w . i absolutely love this machine . we 've used it almost every day since getting it . 
we carry many different latex mattress models . we carry models that have latex only , with no other foam types , and we have hybrid mattresses , which consists of latex and poly foam mixed . the roma mattress consists of a 6 '' core of latex , encased in a cover padded with poly-foam for contouring cushion . poly foam offers a different type of feel than latex , which some customers prefer . if you are wanting an all-latex mattress , with no other types of foams , we offer the naturale on amazon . this mattress consists of 7 '' of dunlop latex , encased in a cotton and wool cover . there is no poly-foam in the mattress . 
i just called the company . the mattress has a 20 year warranty . the second 10 years of that 20 year period is prorated at 10 % per year for replacement . over the period of a year he has roughly 30 warranty calls in regards to a mattress derpression out of hundreds sold in that year .

hello we do not add any flame-retardants to our roma or naturale mattresses . in the roma , we use rayon as a natural fire-barrier . in the naturale , we use the wool as a natural fire-barrier . thank you kindly , have a terrific day ! sleepez 
i have no idea . we are still really enjoying it here . 
yes , i 'm using it on a platform bed without a box spring , and it works great ! 
hello and thank you for your question . the organic cotton knit cover is padded with rayon fiber which acts as the natural fire barrier in the roma mattress . please feel free to call our factory showroom directly at 480-966-9282 if you have any other questions . thanks , sleep ez 
100 % natural dunlop latex . 
yes it can as long as it gives good support and does not have large gaps between wood or springs . avoid foundations made from all metal that have large open spaces . although inexpensive this type of foundation reduces the life of your mattress because of improper support . 
the roma mattress is a stand-alone special . it is equipped with 6 '' of dunlop latex , encased in a non-zipper cotton and foam cover . this mattress is not available in any other type of latex or covering . thank you for your inquiry ! 
i just flip it once a month both side fill good to me 
this latex mattress is the perfect answer to any adjustable bed frame . not only does it mold to your body but it molds to the adjustable bed frame . in addition it has two sides- a medium plush quilted top and a firm quilted bottom-giving you the two most popular options for your sleeping comfort . as close to a custom designed mattress at a fraction of the cost . ninty five percent of all adjustable bed frames sold are twin xl ( 38x80 ) as two of these make an eastern king . roma mattress contains 6 '' of natural dunlop latex made up of one 3 '' layer firm dunlop latex and one 3 '' layer of medium soft dunlop latex . these layers are encased in an organic stretch cotton cover quilted to 1.5 '' of super soft reflex foam to match and marry the feel of the latex contained inside . both sides are quilted as sleep ez brings back the tradition of a two sided mattress flippable mattress . 
this is what i found online about soy foam which is what is in this mattress along with the latex . but i would suggest you google it also to see what you can find on the subject . `` the current market is in a craze over soy-foam . marketed as being better for the environment than polyurethane based foams , we did some research to see what this 'green ' foam was all about . as it turns out , soy foam is not much better than poly-based foam , and some people would argue that it has the same impact . soy foam is actually made the same way as the polyurethane based foam , with 20 % of the mixture being replaced as soy product . so the foam is 20 % soy , 33 % isocyanates , and 47 % polyurethane . ? due to the polyurethane content , the foam still requires the toxic flame retardants , and the foam contains the same level of isocyanates . currently , soy foam also biodegrades at the same rate as poly-based foam . the reason for the low percentage of soy content is that when soy is present at higher levels it produces an undesirable , burnt smell . in addition , the use of pesticides and fertilizers on the soy crop have a negative impact on the environment , as do the mono cultures in which soy is planted . soy is such a diverse and valuable food source that it may not be used best as a plastic substitute . '' 
i talked with a sales rep from sleep ez and he told me that the mattress cover is made with an organic cotton knit material . he also told me that they use 1 4 inch of rayon as a fire retardant on each side and include 1 inch of soy foam under the cover on each side for a plush feeling . he also told me that the firm side of the mattress consists of 4 inches of dunlop natural latex with a 40 ild rating and the medium firm side consists of 3 inches of dunlop latex with a 26 ild rating . the company now has a label on each side of the mattress to identify which side of the mattress is firm and which side is medium firm 
a standard twin roma mattress weighs approximately 70 pounds . please let us know if you have any other questions . thanks ! sleep ez 
twin xl is 38 x 80 compared to a standard twin at 38 x 74. twin xl is one half of a standard king 76x80 ( sometimes called eastern king ) and is the most popular size mattress for a king mattress with two adjustable bases underneath . the roma mattress with dual firmness , depending on which side is up , allows you to select either firm or plush comfort levels . 
twin 
if you looking for a quite firm one , this is not the right one for you . it 's medium firm i would say . 
i 'm not an expert on chemicals , but i bought this natural latex mattress specifically for the reason that it is natural , and avoid allergic reactions that me and my then 6 year old daughter had against the best memory foam mattresses around . we are both perfectly fine with these mattresses . i highly recommend them , and the price is right at amazon too . 
the product dimensions are as follows . 14 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches 
i did receive the free over the door rack !

yes it would , but save yourself some money and buy a bulk roll of inexpensive , lower grade ( like grade 10 ) cheesecloth . it will still let your lawn breathe , let the sun in , and keep the birds away , but at a substantially lower price . dale - brighenti culinary support 
yes , it 's okay to wash our cheesecloth in the washer , but we recommend placing it inside of a tee-shirt or some other piece of clothing to reduce the amount of fraying . wash in cold or warm water to minimize shrinkage . also , if you are going to be reusing the cheesecloth for food prep , we suggest you rinse it again thoroughly after it comes out of the wash to ensure no lingering detergent odors or chemicals get transferred to your foods . dale - brighenti culinary support 
i have n't used my yet so i still have the info sheet which shows a u. s. flag and made in usa . there is a website also . www.brighenti-culinary.com 
hi ashley , all cotton these days is gmo , unless you buy from small organic farmers , and there just are n't enough of those to fulfill the needs of the textile industry . we certainly wish the cotton was non-gmo , but sadly , that 's the world we live in today . 
this is grade 60 cheesecloth which is a really fine mesh , so yes , you could polish a car with it . however , i believe the finer mesh of grade 100 is what they use to polish cars . you can see me using this cheesecloth when i cooked a turkucken recently . search the net for `` t-roy cooks turducken '' and you will find my video . 
the cheesecloth worked perfectly for juicing blackberries . no squeezing required , the juice just ran right through . but making jelly is different from keeping babies safe and clean . i wish i could give you an answer . 
our cheesecloth is 36 inches wide by 180 inches long - 5 sq . yrds . - one continuous piece . 
yes , they 're rather eager for good reviews . 
hello stephen , we have customers who use our cheesecloth for filtering coffee , but it does take at least 2 layers to do an adequate job . the more layers , the finer the filter . 
hello sabrina , we have n't signed up for international shipping because of the expense ... sorry . 
hello wendy - the board is about .5 '' thick and does not have any feet . hope that helps . mike . 
we had the same problem . first i just dishwash soap and a brush to get it off . didnt work . then i out some hand soap on the stains , rubbed it in with my fingers , let it sit for an hour and then washed it off . all stains were gone ! 
hello jeanne - we would not recommend using in the dishwasher . best wishes - mike . 
hello - it is made of slate which is a stone . hope that helps . mike 
hi , this does n't come with a powerstrip , however any 6-outet will fit thanks 
yes ! i leave curling ons and stick it on there while it warms up . 
yes . 
hi , for this item a power strip is not included . thanks ! 
hi ! the diameters are 2 3 4 inches for the big hole , and 2 1 4 inches for the two smaller holes . thanks 
unfortunately no , this item was not designed to be wall mountable . sorry ! 
hello ! the temperature range is ( -58f to 572f ) ( -50c to 300c ) , thank you ! 
yes it would work fine . 
does n't look like it . the battery lid is a simple screw top without any insulation . 
the thermometer is about 6 '' long . it does have a clip on the sheath that protects the probe , but the thermometer is not suitable for candy making unless you want to use it as a quick way to check the temperature . it will not fasten to the side of the pan like regular candy-making thermometers . sorry . 
i would say less than a minute . 
it is capable of reading the temperature of a roast or a turkey , but not to be used as a conventional meat thermometer and left in place during the entire cooking process . 
hello , this item can not be used in the oven . it has a plastic housing . thank you ! 
within 2 numbers example says 52 when it is 54 degrees i also use floating therm too one of the reviews recommended put in a plastic bag my husband did not want to do that and it got full of water to put it in a plastic bag i am now going to put mine in a plastic bag of it seems to make no difference in anything as far as degrees go better safe than sorry for the price it is worth it 
yes . put the empty container or the scale , zero out the weight , then add what you are going to weigh . 
the smallest increment it will go by is one gram . it wo n't register mass until it 's at least one gram . 
it 's 8 '' wide by 7 1 4 '' long and is only 1 4 '' tall - so it 's very slim and would easily fit into a back pack ... .as a former culinary instructor , i would say this would be a great tool for you ... . 
the box says `` made in china '' . 
it would say 1 lb . 8 oz . 
how long is a piece of string ? it will vary from person to person and depend on how often you use it . under one month is n't great , though . 
it uses one cr2032 button battery . 
1 - lithium , 3v cr 2032 
no , not that we have found . we use a clear glass plate and zero it out before putting larger items on it . at least them we can see the screen . 
i bought one a couple months ago and keep it stored upright without a problem . 
does not come with mattress . i 'm happy with it ! just what i wanted . 
they seem very sturdy . we 've used our daybeds as sleeping beds for adults with no problem . 
it was very easy ! i did it myself and it took about an hour . i also put together the trundle that goes with it . it 's a great deal ! 
74 '' long x 38 '' wide 
no . it does not . all you get is the frame . 
about 18 inches . 
yes 
yes - it should fit , from the bottom of the bed rail to the floor there is a 14.5 inch clearance . most trundle bed frames and mattress need 12 inches . 
i have a cheap foam mattress from ikea ( moshult ) that works fine . i 'm not sure how memory foam would work . 
yes 
it takes type o bags , but you can put in type u. type o are the cloth hepa bags and type u are standard paper bags . 
six feet 
the flexible hose is just a few feet long and the extension which comes with the cleaner is 30 or 36 inches long . so , you can use this vacuum to clean sofas and in and around furniture and tables . but , not to vacuum anything which is more than 4 or 5 feet from the floor . 
i did some research on your question as i have never heard these . this vacuum seems to fit the description of buypass . with a bypass system the motor is placed behind the hose and behind the bag . a direct system would be one which pulls dirt through the motor and then on to the bag . i believe a tandem system has two vacuum motors . 
no this model . thank you 
mine came with a 1-year warranty , the usual kind , limited to provable normaluse breakage 
dear melissa , no , this vacuum only has a brush adapter and carpet edge tool . however , it does better than the dyson we bought for $ 500 ... suction and ease of use is well worth the money ... 
it does not , you should pick up at home depot a 5 hp small wet dry vacuum . it is powerful with no beater and works . 
hose is always attached at one end . hose reach is short , sometimes you have to maneuver vacuum to allow a bit more reach . vacuum highly rated by consumer reports and they did mention hose length being short but i never thought it would be a problem . 
if you mean like a roomba , no . if you mean does it have enough power that you just push it ( most of the time ) without feeling its weight -- then yes . 
it does n't get unusually hot..no more so than most stoneware . 
yes 
we do n't have any problem with loading them in the dishwasher . we put them in the top rack usually and they just lean against each other . hope this helps ! 
stoneware . similar to porcelain . they 're very nice ! 
yes they are ! 
the item description says 20 oz . 
yes , this model does have a removable drip tray . it also has specific settings to use for moist or dry foods , so that helps in the prevention of spills . hope this helps ! 
yes it works with jar sealer 
perfect . sealed packages do n't leak . 
it will depend on the brand of bag you use . foodsaver brand ... yes you can . 
since it vacuums out all liquid , you probably will need to pre-freeze . when i need to do sauces , or meats , i make a foodsaver bag , then freeze my food in that , and vacuum and seal it the next day . hope this helps ! btw , we use it more than i could have imagined . it is a nifty device ! my husband loves it . 
to the best of my nowlage you put what ever in the bag and seal it you have to hold the bag there it aslo have a hose which you can buy canister for it and it also has a jar lid one to seal jars if you want it but the canisters and jar sealer are sold separate . i use the canister so far to save my oat meal it works realy good love it . best of luck i hope this answers your question 
you could pack something like that with no problems . the bag you make will have to be a certain size to seal the first end of the bag , and then have enough room to seal the other end . so you can have a `` pencil sized '' row of vanilla beans with a bag about 4 to 5 inches wide . 
yes it is 
i would use the foodsaver bags myself . they are pretty heavy duty and are built for the machine . i would imagine other types of plastic bags would work , they would have to be thicker though . 
have no idea . 
you could slide a piece of cardboard between the mattress and the suspenders 
i do n't have a temperpedic so i ca n't speak to that specifically . my mattress is 13 inches thick and untill i got these suspenders nothing worked . i can not sleep on wrinkled sheets . these i have helped me get sleep . unless your bed is shaped like a circle i would say these are adjustable enough to fit most rectangular shaped beds 
i am so happy with these sheet suspenders . heretofore , each morning i had to practically remake the bed . now , a few tugs and the bed looks as if it had n't been slept in . 
yes ... thats what i have them on 
yes 
there are four in the package . so worth it . i would have paid more . my sheets do not come off the corners . 
yes it keeps the sheets in perfect place . the sheets i purchased were for a deep pocket pillow top mattress so they were way too large and now that i have them strapped they do not move one bit . 
if the flat sheet is folded with hospital corners , it keeps them in place 
no , not yet . 
i do n't have a problem fastening my cal king on all corners . i think a two fastener would work just as well as three . 
in the `` product details '' section it said 34.5 x 1 x 22.8 inches ; 3 pounds 
our mats are flexible but strong enough to hold 3 gallons of water without the mat losing its form . the mat is made of an eco-friendly low destiny polyethylene . 
my under sink plumbing was rather low and worried me if the tray would work but it did . fit perfect ! no adjustments needed . if your pipes come up from the floor then you can easily drill thru this material . just make sure your width and depth measurements are correct . i love this product . hope this helps . 
yes 
yes , very nicely . 
yes , the mat size is 33 '' 3 8 x 21 '' 5 8 x 1 '' . the mat is flexible enough so if the dimension is off a little bit , it 's still okay . 
dimensions 33 & # 8243 ; 5 8 x 21 & # 8243 ; 1 2 x 1 & # 8243 ; ( bottom of mat ) dimensions 34 & # 8243 ; 1 2 x 22 & # 8243 ; 3 4 x 1 & # 8243 ; ( top of mat ) 
yes , it will fit . you 'll have to get creative to get it in around the center support , but i have one and too and i was able to get it situated . 
probably not . the mat is fairly rigid , so i do n't think you 'll have much leeway . however , its rigidity is its saving grace , in that it will stand up well to contain any spill that you have . the edges wo n't flop over and leak anything out . it has saved my posterior many times in the short time i 've had it . 
as far as i can tell , the dimensions were accurate . the raised portion is pretty sturdy but is flexible enough flatten out for a bit , enough to slide under a pipe . hope that helps . i love this sink mat , btw . it has already saved me once . 
hi there k.k , they are 1 1 8 inches deep , 2 5 8 inches at the top and taper slightly down to 2 1 8 inches at the bottom , hope that helps ! 
straight , they are not big , i wanted big extra large muffin tins , i did n't know to ask for jumbo muffin tins . so these are good but for me the wrong size . 
there is a facebook page that has many of them as well as a link to more . i think it is under the makers name . 
measures 13-1 2 by 10 by 1-1 4-inch . it is not jumbo size 
the glasses are large but very easy to hold . they are not what i would call textured , but they are not smooth . you can feel the ridges you see in the picture . hope this helps . 
the exterior of the glasses starts smooth at the top . the lines on the glasses intersect 3 times , after the first intersection the lines become slightly more pronounced ( you ca n't tell looking at them , but i 've been holding one for the last 5 minutes and you can deff feel them around the glass if you start at the top and drag your hand down ) creating these narrow diamonds all around the glass in the middle bottom , changing the glass from a circle at the top to whatever the name is for a 12 sided pretend circle at the bottom . so yes the glasses are smooth , but the design of the glass alters its shape as it goes down providing terrible grip at the top , and a more secure grip in the middle and bottom of the glass . i also have incredibly small hands , ( i 've met 10 year olds with bigger hands and my ring size is 4 ) that being said i have no problem holding onto these hope that helps ! 
yes . 
i am sorry i am unable to answer your question . i am not even sure how to measure circumference for you ... 
yes . these have been through the high heat of the dishwasher dry cycle without issue . 
9 inches 
i have n't put them in the dishwasher yet 
i have the box they came in it says optix 28 ounce tumbler assorted colors . us acrylic llc libertyville illinois 60048. i do not think they are tupperware i really like them nice glasses for the price and they are bpa free ! hope it helps 
i purchased the clear ... and i do n't have any problem . but i only use them inside . 
hello mari , thank you for your interest in our products . yes , we will be coming out with a smaller version in early november . us acrylic , llc 
yes , do not come with it , the frame and headboard . mattress , it is , just . -yoda 
yes very easily 
it has a cover 
it comes pretty compact , then poofs out to full size . its pretty cloppy , with two people i 'm sure you could stuff it in a duffel 
yes , mine is on slats and it 's working fine 
i do n't think so 
i would classify it as medium..no too soft . 
yes 
no , you can not fold it up . 
no i do n't think so . you would ruin the matress 
king bed size 76 '' 80 '' 38 '' x 80 '' standard king california king bed size 72 '' 84 '' 36 '' x 84 '' not as wide but longer than a standard king 
the mattress is medium firmness . my wife likes firm mattresses whereas i like softer . we are both satisfied with this mattress . it 's been nothing but a good buy . quality material and just as good as the big time name brands . i also believe the manufacturer makes them as they are ordered . it 's heavy though so open it by the bed frame lol . 
no i had to buy one separate i am also experienced bad new on the bed the top layer of foam went bad i am the only one that sleeps on it after 8 mos i am fighting with the company to get a replacement since it does have a warranty 
i have mine ontop of the boxsprings ( 11yrs old ) . works perfectly fine . i should review this since i bought it few months ago . its been great for us ! .. 
yes . my husband is 6 ' and this fits him just fine . and it 's super comfy . we know 2 others that have ordered this same mattress and they love it too . 
not at all . i used to get hot on my other mattress but i think this one has a cooling layer because i have not , and i got it last summer so i it is not because of weather . 
yes 
yes you will 
not really but the mattress is great 
no , it does n't . i just have the mattress and i put it on a ikea bed frame and it fitted perfectly . 
i thnk you could as the memory foam is very comfortable but i would n't recommend it since it 's only 6 inches . 
it 's a twin . i bought one for my daughter at christmas . it 's large enough for one adult to fit comfortably . two snuggly . and it 's extremely soft , requiring no box spring . hope that helps . 
no , i have n't had an issue being hot . but i also get cold very easily . 
mattress 
ok & # 65281 ; lt is very good & # 65281 ; 
yes 
it comes in an average sized box it will deffinatley fit in your car when u get home u take it out and unroll it and let it expand 
yes , i have a twin sized one , and it fits perfectly into a standard wooden frame . as far as i can tell , it is sized exactly the same as a traditional spring mattress ( except for the thickness ) . 
you are right . it is not a topper . a proper mattress . 
i do n't think it would make a good futon mattress because of its thickness and firmness . i do n't think you would be able to fold it like a regular futon mattress . if you left it as a bed all the time it would work great . 
i weigh 160 and sleep on my side and stomach . i was worried before i bought this bc some reviews said it was too firm . this bed is perfect ! i literally daydream about getting in bed , it is so comfortable . i have had it for almost a year and it is still like brand new . 
it 's very dense however in terms of firmness it 's probable medium firm . 
i bought at the same time the best price mattress new innovated box spring platform , metal bed frame foundation , for 239 $ and it is now 115.99 on amazon and it works great . i hope this answers your question . 
we used this mattress with an existing bed frame from ikea and it holds it up well . no issue with the wood slatted bed frame ; however if the slats are too far apart , it might be an issue . 
yes 
do n't buy it i went thur 2 of them top layer flattens after 6 mos 
i really do not know . all i can say is that i have slept better on this mattress than any other i have ever owned . 
in have been thur 3 of these beds i have given up the top layer goes bad after about 4 to 6 mos and i am the only one that sleeps on it do n't buy 
amazon has a version that includes smart base brackets for the headboard and footboard . make sure you get that version . if you made the mistake i did and ordered this one without the brackets , they can be ordered separately from the company . 
hmmmm - i 'm going to say , `` no . '' this is the issue : the frame itself is rather `` wide '' . it looks like this frame ( mine is a calking ) is just a bit wider than my former frame ( which was wooden - and held the boxsping inside ) . i currently have a sterns & foster calking set on this frame - once i added the boxspring and mattress -it became higher than a traditional bed set - but i love the frame . absolutley no `` wobble wiggle '' . hope this helps . 
yes you may , but you do n't have to place a box spring as this product can replace old box spring and bed frame . 
its not an adjustable frame but it is firm straight out of the box . 
yes it does . my son 's full size mattress fits perfectly ... the frame is a tad bit bigger but you ca n't tell . the mattress does n't slide or move at all . 
shipping box dimensions are 39 '' x 28 '' x 7.5 '' . 
it does not squeak at all ! ! ! 
probably . make sure you count all the legs . btw i still would n't buy it 
it would depend on how much longer it is than the frame . i would think a couple inches at either ennd would not matter . however anything more than that i doubt it would work . 
i 'm not sure what you are asking as steel is a type of metal . however , as far as i can tell , the bed frame is made of all steel . it is very sturdy and well made . we are very happy with the quality and recommend it highly . we would definitely purchase it again . 
it sure would with no problem ! ! 
sure . and what works best imho is an electric carving knife . cutting foam with those is the only reason i keep one around . 
you do not need a box spring . it is extremely comfortable based on memory foam . you do need a bed frame for support . i do not have a box spring but do use a wire frame which i also ordered from amazon . enjoy ! . 
i like mine . it is on the floor . if you had it on a box spring , it might have less support . so put it on 3 4 in plywood . 
i am afraid i can not help you . mattresses come in the mail vaccum packed or deflated in a roll . i am not sure how to get them back in that state ! 
no . i put it directly on the floor and unless you are on your knees you wo n't feel the floor . i 'm 6 ' 3 '' 185 . 
the amazon specs show shipping weight as 26.6 lbs . i 'm a 5'3 '' grandmother and it was very easy for me to handle compared to a traditional twin mattress . 
the mattress has a cover that you can remove by unzipping it . other than that there should be nothing stopping you from cutting it evenly with the proper tool . 
yes 
about a 6 or 7 compared to solid ground . quite firm , but very comfortable . 
if your air mattress is a standard size queen ( 60 '' x 80 ) it will fit . there are small brackets to hold mattress in place and there are no sharp edges or protrusions to cause a puncture . it folds flat so it travels well . 
you could still easily sit a box spring on this , although , depending on the thickness of your mattress and box spring , your bed might be too high off the ground . 
you can use the 2 halves independently , but they wo n't be the same width as a twin . they will be 30 '' wide . 
i do n't think so do n't see any place to attach it sorry 
these items ship via fedex ground . fedex may or may not deliver the package directly to your door if you live in an apartment complex . fedex will go by their standard protocol for deliveries to apartment complexes . 
it folds flat , but is as long as a mattress . it would work great for a blow up mattress , as long as you have space to store it flat . you could easily fit it under a regular bed ( flat ) and just open it up when needed . 
i have found no noise or squeaking in the one i purchased . the person who sleeps on it does n't move around a lot . hope this helps 
the spa sensation sold by wal-mart states it has a 1200lb weight limit on full and 2400lb on queen , king and california king . it is a similar product . i cant guarantee that this is accurate , but based on the construction of the frame it is very sturdy . 
no you do not have to get rid of your box spring for this bed frame . you bed overall may be higher . but try it to determine your preference . 
yes it is very sturdy my husband is 6 '4 '' and 300 pounds and had no problem sleeping on it 
hi tina , the spatulas are manufactured in china . hope this helps . regards , matt - starpack team member 
hi jo , we test all of our products thoroughly and found these spatulas to be particularly odor and stain resistant . this would be due to the quality of silicone we use . in addition , the whole starpack team use our products at home and we have n't had any reports from them or any of our happy customers of the spatulas retaining any odors at all . hope this helps ! 
the handles are symmetrical . they do not have molded grips for left or right hands . i am able to comfortably use mine with either hand . 
hi dustin , yes the spatulas are bpa free . no plastics , just 100 % food grade silicone . hope this helps . regards , matt - starpack team 
the heads of the spatulas are smooth , slightly concave , no ridges . 
starpack sent an e-mail with a pdf attachment 
i have washed my spatulas in the dishwasher but never felt the need to sanitize them and they are still fine . they are supposed to be good for high heat but i do n't know how high heat the sanitize cycle is . 
no 
spatulas are not meant to be firm but have some give . i would not say they `` flop around '' and i use them to mix when i cook but if i have something stiff , i use a spoon which is the proper utensil . i love my spatula set and i like my spoons . both work well for their intended purpose . 
these are the same on both sides 
400 pound by their literature . 
i assume they mean bmi . there is also a `` stability factor '' for which i do n't know the algorithm , but i assume it is obtained from the steadiness of the reading when i step on the scale . if one is swaying about , it takes a longer time to report the average so it could simply be related to the standard deviation of the readings and how long it takes to get enough data to record the mean value to within 0.1 lbs at a selected probability . 
the blip care units will still save the information but ca n't be seen until uploaded and need an internet connection to upload . in other words you weigh yourself on a blipcare scale or take your blood pressure on their monitor when you have no internet connection , you will see the value on the scale meter but it will not upload and be stored for analysis until your unit has internet access . 
i do n't think so . i do n't have a fitbit . the tech level of this scale is lower monotone , not higher complex with some options for network connections . i love the scale though ! it 's great to have the graphs and bmi on the account page . you 'll love it . 
we are approaching the app developers to see if they would allow us to integrate .

its a little dark red . did n't say about weight limit no more than 300lb should ok . 
it is extremely comfortable , very thick . i told my mother about this since she needs a new mattress and box spring and she is going to order this one that i have . i told her about the free shipping and she really liked that 
the mattress is about 10 '' and the box is about 8 '' so you should get about 18 '' together 
yes , it comes with both 
its about 10 '' 
i see its available now 
i just set my old mattress by the curb on garbage day and someone picked it up ! 
no , you have to run off the wort from the grain into another vessel for boiling . unless you are doing some sort of biab . 
you do n't need to worry about it.the top of the false bottom is above the outlet valve and holds the grain up so the mash flows through the outlet . 
yes , it has a false bottom that can be lifted out . 
inside diameter is 13.75 '' , inside height is 13.75 '' , bottom is thick and laminated , i guess for even heat distribution . it is well made , you have to install drain and thermometer . ignoring price and rated from 1 to 10 i would give it an 8 . 
not sure where made . but the inside appears to be the same as the outside but for the color which is white .

the red ruffle canisters are the following dimmensions : xl 11 3 4 '' h x 7 '' w l 10 1 2 '' h x 6 3 4 '' w m 9 '' h x 5 3 4 '' w s 8 1 2 '' h x 5 '' w customer service 
i bought this tuscany canister set , as well as the bread box in mid january . i have n't had any moisture problems . i live in northern maine and heat with wood so the air in my house is dry and i use a humidifier . let suggestion would be to check the humidity level in your house . 
thank you for your inquiry . sorry , there is no white one yet . 
the large one holds about five pounds of flour . second one holds almost five pounds of sugar 
no , and i would n't buy them . they are to fragile to use everyday . 
it 's a bright true red . really perks up a room . i love my canisters . 
the color is very bright red as in cherry or coke . i have struggled with the capacity of the largest as it only holds about 3 lbs of flour or sugar . the next largest size holds about 2-3 lbs . but , i love them as they look so great on my counter and get many compliments . 
i 'd say one package of the average size store-bought cookies . 
thanks for your inquiry . measures appox . 8 '' h without lid x 11 1 2 '' h with lid x 7 '' w from top x 6 '' w from bottom . it holds about 3-4 pounds of sugar or flour . 
thank you for your inquiry , the red ruffle cookie jar is 8 '' h without lid x 11 1 2 '' h with lid x 7 '' w from top x 6 '' w from bottom customer service 
thank you for your inquiry , yes , the red ruffle cookie jar comes with neopene gasket . customer service 
hi laurel , the dimensions are from large to small . 10x5 , 9x4 , 8 1 2x4 1 2 , 8x4 . i love them . they look beautiful and hold so much in each size . debbie m . 
it is hard to give the shade a label , but i would probably call it `` medium green '' . i have been very pleased with the quality and the color . 
thank you for your inquiry yes the consistents work for flour tea coffee sugur ... ... .etc 
hi donna , the canisters just have a seal along the edge . they are not air tight . the lids fit loosely on each one . i keep pre made coffee filters in them for the week and they always stay fresh and perfect . i love them so much and they look beautiful . i hope this helps a bit . debbie 
i think it is . i just tested it and it seems firm to me . 
this is not a true memory foam mattress . it is a foam-like core ( not springs ) , but it does not feel firm and dense like memory foam . this is a soft bed . i would not suggest this mattress for heavier adults or for couples to share . i bought this for my teenage daughter and she has been raving about it 's comfort . i slept on the mattress last night , while she was having a sleepover , to test it out and she 's right . it is incredibly comfortable ; especially for the price ! 
this mattress is sold as a standard twin size 38x74 and a full size 54x74 . the mattress is 7 inches thick . 
i 'm a 240lb adult and this thickness of mattress is comfortable enough that it turned a horrid futon bed into a place where i can actually sleep . 
it 's 12x12x40 in the box 
yes , we live on oahu and received our mattresses in two days . 
we have those wooden slats that are attached with fiber strips . ( they come rolled up - ikea ) a box spring would make it too tall for a bunk bed . several pieces of wood would probably work . for comfort , you do n't need a box mattress . 
you could fold it in half and it would fit in the jumbo size ziploc vacuum storage bag , no problem . 
i think depends on weight . i can say that it is very firm and soft at the same time , very well made . great for a kid or light weight adult . i 'm 300lbs and it is comfortable for me to lay on but probably would start to lose shape after a while . i bought this for my daughter and she loves it more than a expensive pillow top . 
in the box i received was a twin size mattress that was compressed foam rolled up like a jelly roll . once i pulled off the compression tape and rolled it out the mattress expanded to a 7 inch depth within 24 hours . mine did not come with any liners or pads , or frame . i hope this answers your question . 
its two mattresses if you read the description below ... '' the mattress is available as a twin or full size by itself , but you can get even more savings by purchasing the twin twin option and receive 2 twin mattresses or the twin full option and receive 1 twin and 1 full mattress . if you decide to choose the two mattress option these beds will ship to your home in the same shipping box . '' 
with the twin option you are getting only one mattress . if you order the twin full option you are getting one twin and one full mattress . we offer a price break on the combo bed orders because we can ship them together in the same box . 
sorry , i had it for a month and trashed the box . i think it 's 12 '' x 12 '' x 40 '' and about 30 lbs . 
no 
no you need a box spring or you could get a piece of plywood cut to the size for the bunk bed . 
75 x 37 x 7. the twin twin is two twin sized mattresses . 
20 lbs 
yes 
the quilting is only on onevery side . 
bedding is firm , but has a softness to it , i am 64 yrs . old and i sleep very well in it.another thing , there is no way you can jump on it , you may prefer to buy a thicker mattress . 
correct . it is foam all the way through and as such , is easier for them to ship . the package is like a really long document package so outside of length is easy to move around a house . 
this mattress is currently on the top bunk . i ca n't remember if it has slats or not , i bought it for my grandaughter . there has been no problems at all as the top bunk . if the bottom bunk is the same as the top bunk i see no reason to use it there , it is very sturdy . 
well it 's just like sleeping on a regular mattress ... . once it expands , it stays that way ( like a regular , normal mattress ) . it 's just the way it 's packed for shipment that makes u wonder how it 's a matress ... 
i was very shock by the package , it 's in a box that is 4ft tall , square box . it fits really well and it van definitely fix in your car . 
i think it would be too thin and uncomfortable . i have it on a bed frame and i had to buy a 2 inch mattress topper for it and it 's okay now . 
no . just mattress 
yes the measurements and weight are correct . you will be shocked in the box that it arrives in . they squeeze every molecule of air out of it . just stand back when you release it for your own protection . : ) 
our came airtight white plastic 
no 
yes it is and it is very comfortable . we have it on an ikea daybed . i weigh 185 pounds and sleep on it fairly often w my 2 year old . we are very happy with our purchase . 
hi julia , yes these mats are 100 % bpa free . they are made from a fiber glass weave coated in premium , food grade silicone that is fda compliant . i hope this helps . regards , matt - starpack team member 
hi mary , these mats are made at the top silicone manufacturer in china using the highest quality , fda compliant silicone . the quality is comparable to big name brands like silpat , but are better value as you 're not paying for the brand . we hope this helps . if you have any further questions just ask . thanks and regards , matt - starpack team member 
i 'm not sure why you 'd want to , as these mats are for baking . dough : yes . hot glue gun : not so much . 
hi carrie , this is a common question but the answer is absolutely no way should they ever be cut . the reason is that the underlying structure of all silicone baking mats is a fiber glass weave which should not be exposed by cutting the mat ( or cutting ingredients on it ) , nor should it be folded creased . best advice is to acquire a better suited pan , which will then be protected by the mat . i hope this helps . any further questions just ask ! best regards , matt - starpack team member 
no 
thank you for posting your question . unfortunately this item can not be shipped to australia . it is currently sold by a seller who sets their own policies . have a good one ! 
unfortunately the calendar for 2014 was n't signed . i tried getting his signed 2015 calender when it first came out on districtline.com joeygraceffa , but they were all sold out . your best bet if you want a signed 2015 calender would be to go on districtline.com joeygraceffa . they 're a little more expensive , but there should be some in stock . also more joey merch there . not to make anyone stray away from amazon.com though : 
yes all 12. i just got mine . love it ! : ) 
joey said on the vlog about this that it will probably ship international . but not 100 % sure 
joey tweeted he 's working on international shipping ! = ) take care & lt ; 3 https : twitter.com joeygraceffa status 422796513589198848

yes , as a matter of fact , this was the main reason for me to purchase this item . if you get the 3 lb bags of apples - they are small - like a tennis ball - they slice perfectly . start it off without the gripper so you get a flat side of the apple , then put the gripper on and slice fast ! they do slice thin , probably about the thickness of a greeting card . i pop them in the oven at about 190 degrees for about 45 minutes and they turn just a tad tan and get crisp . i do n't season them at all though you can sprinkle some cinnamon if you want that flavor . they turn out great and you can eat a whole gallon ziploc bag of them without any guilt ! 
yes i can . i love it 
blades are very sharp stainless ... the rest is plastic ... easy to use and store . 
even though i have a dishwasher i often wash the set by hand . it 's no more dangerous than any other grater cutter.. i have never cut myself washing it ( although i did julienne my finger when cutting a carrot one time - my fault ) . just be sure to make all your washing strokes in the opposite direction from the one you would use when cutting and you should be fine . 
yes , that is what the box says ! 
yes they are . i would recommend putting them on the top shelf only . 
this particular product only comes in one size . 
sure it should work fine 
china 
yes , but the cheese should be cold and preferably a harder cheese . the apples turn out perfectly ! 
the main color of this bedding is beige . the gray is just in the pattern on the bedding . if you 're looking for a gray bed set this is not the one you should go with . if you are looking for a beige taupe this is perfect . the set is really nice . 
i would describe it as an off-white or cream color . definitely not beige . hope that helps ! 
yes , it is stitched in a number of places . i have n't washed it yet though , so i ca n't comment on how well it holds up to washing . 
i doubt it . mine is a queen and it fits well . it would be too short i assume on a king 
well , that is a good question . i really do not know if the fill is cotton . the accessories are cotton . at least one of the pillows is cotton and perhaps a polyester . what i do know is that i am very pleased with this comforter set . it looks amazing ! the picture really does not do it justice . 
it comes with shams for the standard and european style pillows , but it does come with small decorative pillows . 
it is more of a whiter background but not a stark white . i bought sheets at bbb in slate that go well with the grey in the spread . it is not a heavy comforter which is good for my flashes ! 
alex , the filling is listed as 100 % polyester on the tag . have a good day ! 
the stainless steel part can easily swing up to clean underneath it . 
yes , i recently installed one in a stainless steel sink and also wrote a review of the product 
it is updated now . sorry that i could n't catch your question sooner . our old picture contains no background , which does not correctly reflect the look of our clear ( transparent ) sticker . i replaced it some time ago to include the background in the photos , as suggested by our customers . the new photos clearly illustrate how our sponge holder looks on a stainless steel kitchen sink , a ceramic kitchen sink , and a plastic utility tub . thanks very much for the questions . 
there is no definite lifespan . it depends on the pressure exerted on the sticker and the surrounding condition . we are confident the sticker can support the holder for at least 3 years under normal room temperature . 
sorry that i could not answer your question soon . unfortunately , your application is quite deviated from our current design . i do n't think our sponge holder is a right fit for those sponges with the soap in the handle . i will discuss your need with our team . thanks very much for the question . 
our sticker will certainly bind on a granite composite sink . as to the mark residue , i will check with our sticker 's developers and get back to you . at this moment , from the seller 's view , i recommend only to consider our products in the granite sink if you do n't plan on removing it in the near future . 
yes , our sticker will work on a composite sink . granite composite sinks are about 80 percent granite and 20 percent acrylic resin . since granite is a porous material , these sinks are prone to stains over time . because our sticker uses a clear adhesive and most of granite composite sinks are matte-finished , a mark can occur after removal depending on the compositions of the granite . in most cases , the mark is not noticeable . on the other hand , the area covered by the sticker is protected from daily use , as compared to the exposed area in the sink . at some point , the different could result in a mark . 
i have n't tried moving it , but the description says you can . 
it can hold just about anything . depending on the shape and size of the brush , it should fit through the center hole . 
just a little wider and a little deeper than a regular size sponge . one sponge fits in there nicely - no room for anything else . love this product ! 
the last ones i got were not boxed , just shrink-wrapped . but they were still the same as the filters that i received the last time i ordered and got the 'boxed ' version ... 
arizona 
i 'm sorry . i have a watts system . i do not know what to use for the whirlpool system . 
yes it does . i have a watts wp4v reverse osmosis system and i bought this kit a couple of months ago . i exchanged all 3 filters of the system from this kit . the extra carbon and sediment filter i put aside and will use them in another 4 months . this kit does not include the reverse osmosis membrane . if you need to replace it you must order it separately . the membrane should last for at least 5 years or so . 
they are aprox . 3 '' inches us apart 
it 's about 6-7 inches from the ground i think . you could probably store rapping paper rolls or super slim shoe boxes , but there really is n't that much clearance for me to put much else under there . 
detailed desc . says 10.25 '' to top of slat . 
no , we do n't use one . i believe it is made to be used without a box spring . the slat supports seem well made , stable , and supportive . 
yes , the legs attach separately . 
the bed feels pretty solid . i have a tempurpedic mattress on it and it fits well does n't creak or shake . my partner and i weigh about 300 pounds combined so we are n't particularly putting a lot of strain on it , but i toss around in my sleep and have n't felt unstable nor have i heard any squeaking in the 6 months i 've had it . 
i imagine you can because it will sit on top of planks . functionally it should be fine . i use a mattress only though . you will want to be careful of the total height because it will take away from the look of the headboard . also , you will need to completely cover the box spring because of how it sits inside the frame . a bed skirt will not work with this frame . hope this helps . ryan 
it could absolutely ! however the center legs for the slat supports would need to be cut down or something shorter in their space . since the slats sit a couple inches higher than the frame . 
i have an 18 inch thick mattress and it looks great with this bed . 
those are crossbar supports to give some added support in the middle . you need to drill them manually . seems like something that was included last minute since everything else does n't require additional tools . 
mine came with all the hardware needed to bolt the frame to it . be care not to over tighten because the frame is wood . but it needs to be tight . its a good idea to check it about a week after use and re tighten as needed . a little tighter than the previous time until it stays tight . just a suggestion is all . 
height is 50 inches . width is 63 inches . 
yes , if you have a frame . 
i would say yes but not 100 % sure . the top half of the headboard is separate from the legs when it arrives . i have a platform bed with a ridge on all four sides and i just propped the top half on the ridge and scooted the mattress up against it . it stays just fine . and it 's not too heavy so as long as the mattress is against it , it 's sturdy . looks great , too ! ! ! 
i 'm not at home right now but i believe so ... .but it changes the entire look of the room . 
50 its a bit short for my bed . but my bed is tall 
i have mine against the wall so i really could not tell . 
21 inches from the floor to the bottom part of the upholstered headboard . i use mine with a regular metal frame and box spring . there is no gap from the top of the bed and the headboard if that 's what you were asking . 
18.5 '' 
standard plastic air lock -- chicago brew werks 
yes , with a rubber grommet . 
i did not notice an odor , however , i did have to return it . i bought it for my kids and they took one step and went flying . a big slippery . 
i do n't see pvc free anywhere in the description . i see material : pvc , and made of allergen free pvc . it 's has a rubbery feel that 's all i can say for sure . 
yes . : ) 
it does stay in place . : - ) i also do n't leave mine in the tub , we remove it after bathing which leaves the suction cups time to dry out and prevents mildew , etc . 
it is not very thick as far as i am concerned but the suction cups do create a space between that does add a padded feel . 
i do n't have a textured tub but i would think it would actually adhere better . great mat 
yes it is . 
no it does not have any smell . 
hi liz : the tranquility bathmat has small holes in the surface of the mat for effective drainage . therefore , it is remotely possible that hair may wash through the small holes and collect , but we have not heard of specific issues from our customers . i hope this answer helps . please advise if you require additional information . 
hi , they are manufactured in china . 
mine came in a sturdy cardboard box that fits nicely in my kitchen drawers . 
i have n't made cheesecake , but i have found that these are extremely easy to use and really do n't stick . 
they are made from bpa free silicone . 
the cup is approximately 1 3 4 '' tall , it has a 1 3 4 '' diameter for the base and 2 3 4 '' diameter for the top of the cup . i used approximately 1 4 cup batter for each and did n't have any overflow . 
turn them inside out and use a sponge with soapy water . cleans like a breeze and the baked goods slide out of them better than any other brand i 've used ! ! 
standard 2 1 2 '' diameter 
i did the first time , but they said you could just put them on a baking sheet so the second time when i was making 4 mini quiches i just put them on a baking sheet with a rim and they worked perfectly . 
yes , the silicone baking cups can be used in the freezer . i wanted large ice cubes for my pitchers of sweet tea and had no large ice trays . so i filled each cup almost to the top with water , set them on a tray to make carrying them easier , and froze until the cubes were set . the ice-cubes popped right out and looked really cool too ! ! 
they are fairly thin and flexible . i have not tried them standing alone -- they work wonderfully in a muffin tin . i think it would depend on what was in them - a thickish batter would probably be fine . 
no . the directions show the cord wrapped around the base . the lack of a retractable cord would n't deter me from buying this again though . i love it 
its a `` smoky '' color plastic , but i do not have any problem seeing the water level and or filling the unit whosoever . of course , i was taught years ago to have `` good lighting at all times '' when ironing and that is important at all times . this is the best iron i have ever used in the past 55 years of ironing ! for the price , its amazing ! it just has a creature-comfort `` feel '' that is unlike any other i have used . to each his her own of course . good luck ! skip ... ... do n't forget either , this unit is recommended to use only `` tap '' unconditioned water ! do not use distilled water - use straight from the tap . there is a warning regarding this and , in checking with you water company if you have `` hard '' water or not ; if so , then you can use a mixture of distilled water and regular tap water . 
i have this iron , and i find that it heats quite rapidly . 
*wattage : 1725 watts *voltage : 110 volts 
it does not have on off button only the temperature choosing role 
have n't had to clean the bottom , starch does n't stick . really does move smoothly over any fabric . i have n't actually cleaned the calcium build up from water , after using the steam iron i just unplug and hold off the sink , put on a full steam and then press the steam button on the handle . that seems to clean the steam vents and the steam is excellent . 
i am not certain of that , upon searching their website , i could not find an answer . you may have to give them a call at 800-395-8325 or go to their website and send them an email . 
this iron is 120v . 
i returned mt t-fal because it leaked badly ! 
ca n't say exactly , but it less than 3lb 
they are 600 watts 
110 volt us 
i do n't see why it would n't 
600 watts more than enough power breakdown greens fruits fantastic machine 
i use them for egg muffins , and have n't been brave enough to try it without a spray of pam in each cup . i hate scrubbing eggs off of pans , so these are excellent . the egg muffins fall right out . however , these silicone pans are flimsy and need to be supported by another cookie sheet underneath to transfer from the counter to the oven . 
this muffin pan is thick and sturdy enough to stand directly on the oven rack but not as rigid as a metal pan . it will bend a little between the cups so you 'll want to make sure each row of cups is on the rack . hope that helps . 
there is n't any problem with gluten free baking 
simple home creations is based in the us . this product manufactured in china . 
absolutely , any standard size liner should work . you just do n't need to use them . 
yes it is . it is somewhat heavy but i do n't have hand strength and i can use it easily . it is so much better than any other one i have used . put unpeeled clove in , close and out the garlic comes ... open , peel out the peel and continue on . i highly recommend it . 
no tool . but , funny didnt think about ... all i did was rinse 
garlic press should be the same , but what 's the garlic peelers ? 
the propresser garlic press works on ginger beautifully peeled or with the skin on especially on those `` little fingers '' that can seem too much trouble to peel the skin off first . simply cut in quarter to half inch slices that fit the basket and press . one recommendation , however , if you need more than one or two tablespoons of pressed ginger , peel the large pieces of ginger before pressing to speed up the process . saves on cleaning out the ginger skins . for most work , however , you wo n't need to peel at all . terrific tool ! ! ! 
one does not have to peel the garlic . just put it into the compartment , vigorously squeeze , and scrape out the crushed peel . 
it 's made in china , `` exclusively for orblue '' as stated on the box . 
it 's sturdy and works great at pressing large several cloves , but it might not be the best for your needs 
it is 8 '' long and 3 '' wide at its widest point . 
i do n't know the exact dimensions without getting it out to measure , but it 's about 1-1 2 '' by 3 4 '' and close to an inch deep on the deepest end . good sized for most home kitchens . 
very easy to clean . 
the collection comes with a bed skirt , comforter , 2 shams , and throw pillows ( i think 3 ) . it is an awesome bed set . 
i 've washed mine 4 or 5 times now with no issue . i just use tumble dry low . 
i really have no idea , but for me it does n't matter . i was completely surprised by the quality . this is by far the best bed set i have ever bought . it 's soft , warm but not bulky . i totally love it . 
the comforter will hold up with washes , however we do not suggest washing it excessively . 
it 's not heavy at all but if you use it to cover up its very warm . 
hi krissy , the peeler is made in china . best regards joe kenny 
i have n't tried it on zucchini yet but yes the carrots came out nice and long . i would not cut the top of the carrot until i use it ( just to have some way to hold them ) unless their tips are better . i have n't read their tips yet , but again despite all that the carrots came out fine . 
i use a toothbrush & it works great ! the bristeles have never gotten torn or stuck . 
i do n't have it in front of me but id guess 3 inches wide-ish , the entire peeler is stainless , and no no cover and its sharp ! 
i do n't really know , but it is super easy to wash it ! i just put it under the sink 's faucet and use a kitchen brush if is necessary 
yes 
it is thicker than literal paper-thin , there is definitely some substance to it . i ca n't tell you exact measurements . 
i 've seen it suggested that , because these blades are so sharp , it is best to hand wash to retain the sharpness . 
it does not working as good as i thought . i cut my finger the other day . 
not that i know of . 
well , i have to make a confession . i wash them on gentle cycle in the washing machine , and air dry them . i have had no problems at all . i wash them with my other dish towels and kitchen rags . i know i 'm supposed to hand wash them , but i , well , you know . so far , i have had no problems washing on gentle cycle . i may be shortening the life of the glove : i 'll update and let you know . but for now , gentle cycle is working beautifully for me . they take no time at all to air dry , and i have used them slightly damp before . they still work ! excellent gloves , and i ca n't recommend them enough ! ! 
yes 
i have large hands and the gloves are very big on me but are fantastic gloves so good i bought two pair . if they do n't fit you can easily return 
have not washed mine yet but this is what i am going to do . i am going to treat them like they were a gentle item i wash , i am going to spray them with fantasic because fantastic takes off everything it is amazing.. i am then going to put them into a pillow case tie it shut and wash them on gentle cycle.. i then am going to air dry them ... or in summer i will lay them out on my patio table to dry in the sun .. god bless 
i have n't experienced it , but i 'd have to equate it to a wet hot pad - will burn and how ! i 'd avoid it . 
absolutely . i grabbed a pan straight from our smoker after it had been on for about 6 hours - and they worked perfectly . 
i do n't see why not . they are rated higher than that . 
the length from the tip of the middle finger to the end of the wrist is 10.5 inches ( total length over all ) from the wrist joint to the end of the glove is just over 3.5 inches . ( 10.5 - 3.5 + 7 inches for the hand ) i have not found this to be a issue . however depending on far into the oven you are reaching this could present a problem . hope the info helps you make a decision . they are excellent gloves and have been washed twice and still provide excellent protection from heat . 
yes . the refillable coffee filter is included 
i always do since it makes clean-up so must easier and faster . i just place the tea bag in the little plastic cup where you would notmally place the coffee grinds and then screw the top part over it and voilla , you are ready make a lovely single cup of tea . nothing could be easier . i purchased two since once the rubber flapper stops sealing i have another one i can use . best thing since sliced bread . i hope that this helps you . 
i have both this and a keurig vue brewer , and i 'm thinking about selling the keyring since i use this daily . i 've noticed that it is faster for me at least . my tap water gets super hot very quickly so i do n't have to microwave water , but even that would just take about a minute and a half . also i 've tried the same flavor type of coffee in the vue brewer and the my jo , and i enjoy the myjo more . it does n't taste burnt like the vue often tasted . but it does brew a tad weaker than the vue brewer , but i prefer that . i 've tried iced tea , cocoa , and apple cider pods and they turn out great . 
there is a silicone valve , in the upper reservoir , designed to keep water in when no pressure is applied . that valve has a slit that may not have been fully opened during manufacturing . it is a simple fix . take the valve out ( something you 'll do from time to time for cleaning anyway ) and pinch it to make the slit open . once you 've done so , re-insert the valve and you should be good to go . 
i usely wait about 10 seconds between pumps , ,makes a much better coffee , and use 10 oz water 
i 've had mine for months , the gasket seems fine . what can happen is that air escapes if the seal on the compressor , for lack of a better term , is not seated properly . i run the bead that contacts the container under the tap to moisten it . this insures a proper seal with no air escaping . as an aside , gaskets can be hsd very inexpensively . 
any brand will as long as they would fit in a keurig 
the coffee will probably be weaker since the grounds do n't react the same with hot and cold water . unfortunately this will probably break before you get much use out of it though . i got 8-10 uses from 2 of them before the reservoir gasket fell out . 
it is very light i would say about a pound . it is about 4 '' in diameter and about 10 '' tall when fully assembled . 
yes it is 
it feels like it is just fabric with no plastic inside . 
we wipe them down with a soapy dishrag at end of day . my two preschoolers manage to keep them fairly clean and they work very well . 
i do n't think this bag would be big enough for 2 lunches - unless it was a light lunch or just snacks . i guess it depends on what you 'd want to pack . i believe they make a larger size that would work better . ( i also agree with the suggestion to get the one with the zipper . that 's what we have . ) 
it depends ... i use it to put my expressed milk in which is usually 2 tommee tippee bottles ( very fat bottles ) and 2 medela bottles ( more normal sized bottles ) . i could not put more than 2 tommee tippee bottles in this one where as the other lunch style bag i have i can store 4 tommee tippee bottles . the bag is plenty tall , it 's the width that is the only thing that would limit you . hope this helps ! 
it will hold three 16.9oz bottles of water . that 's pre-bottled like poland spring or something similar with the same 16.9oz of water . as for bottles you fill yourself , it can fit three 20oz rubbermaid bottles or three sigg metal .06 liter ( 20.3oz ) bottles . tried it with a 22oz camelbak bottle to find it does n't fit . mostly because of the swing of the lid the carabiner attaches to , and the rubber nipple . camelbaks , unless you use the kid size bottles , are too tall . stick with any water bottle with a flat top that can carry 20 oz of water and you can fit three of them in packit with no trouble . 
seven cans fit into the bag after it is frozen and the bag will still zip closed . 
i 'm pretty sure the measurements are part of the description on amazon but it 's bigger than i thought . i 've only had it 2 months so `` over time '' i ca n't attest to . 
hello , and thank you for your inquiry . i apologize that the inside dimensions are not listed . if i get any more lunch bags to sell , i will make sure i will measure both inside and the outside of the lunch box . i did a little searching , and though i could n't find the dimensions of the inside of the bag , i was able to find the dimensions of the bag folded and standing tall which are 10 '' h x 8 '' w x 5 '' d ( 2 '' h x 8 '' w x 5 '' d folded ) . thank you for visiting my store , and have a nice day . 
i can fit a 16.9 oz drink bottle & rectangular containers with room for more . it is roomy and can fit a good amount of food 
does n't sweat on the outside - only the inside . you should be good . never noticed moisture on the outside . 
the comforter is on the bed in the guest bedroom and i have n't had any complaints . 
its definitely for summer . its very light weight . in the winter you will have to switch to a heavier comforter . i have washed it twice , and its fine . i love the look of it , as well as the decorative pillows . 
i live in the caribbean were it is summer and hot throughout the year . if you do n't have your ac on and on a 17 degrees celsius it can get really hot . 
to fill both sides , you actually need more than one box of cake batter . i feel like i used 1 plus another 1 3. but it turned out amazing . 
the bottom is 6 1 2 '' round & 3 3 4 '' deep . the top is 7 '' round at the widest & 3 1 2 '' deep so final cupcake would be around 7 '' wide and a little over 7 '' tall . hope this helps ! 
is unstable and is mushy 
you do n't need any liners . just use cooking spray . 
absolutely you can . this is a very comfortable chair . 
for me this chair is really comfortable and imo this is the best chair you can get in that price range . i live in seattle and it took 4 days after i placed the order . 
linda , maybe not . the depth of the seat ( edge of seat to back ) is roughly 22 '' . i 'm 5'8 '' and the seat fits me perfectly ( legs bent at knee and feet on the floor and with my back firmly against the back rest ) . find a chair to set in it and measure the back rest to where your knees bend . if it 's less than about 22 '' , you may have some discomfort setting in this chair in a non-reclined position ( as you have probably have found in setting in a lot of seats ) . hope this helps . don 
it would be a tight fit , and it is also on the narrow side in the hip area , as well . 
hello , this chair is currently $ 238.14 total . $ 233.65 plus $ 4.49 shipping , total cost $ 238.14 . at the moment i am offering the chair at the lowest total price . that is what you will pay at check out . nothing more . pay that , and the chair will be delivered to you home . thank you , joel , supplied2you 
hello , no tax , free shipping ! : ) thank you , joel 
hello , true ! thank you , joel 
on the right side of the chair , there is an indentation in the chair with a small handle which you pull up and back . this allows the foot rest to actually ppop up , if you do nit attempt to put your legs on the foot rest to allow it to bring it up gently . i found it extremely difficult to bring the foot rest back into the a '' chair position '' for the first week or so , but now it is doing just fine . i found no button or lever to cause the foot rest to go back to the original position ; it must be pushed back until you hear a 'click ' . 
light enough that my daughter and i picked it up and carried it into the house and set it up in my bedroom . ( e.g. , pretty light ) . 
the chair is very small . but it recliners fully at 6 inches from the wall . it is like a wall-hugger . 
the short answer is yes they are egyptian cotton . they are bright white , but have a bit of a texture to them almost like linen , and they are a very decent weight . for a larger napkin which is heavier and has no texture check out the satin band napkins by typing b00cen2nbu into the search box . i get asked all the time what is egyptian cotton , so here is the technical answer : egyptian cotton is `` extra long staple '' mostly made from a cotton plant called gossypium barbadense . these plants are , in fact , grown all over the world including in the us , china and india . egyptian cotton does not necessarily mean that the cotton was grown in egypt . if the cotton is actually from egypt it is called giza cotton . the fiber length is around 1 3 8 inches which is extra long and does make for a softer more luxurious product . 
if you are looking for a very soft napkin , this is not the one for you . these napkins hold there shape after many launderings , a characteristic that i was looking for . 
i try to keep these napkins at a good price year around so i do n't often discount them . i do , however , try to offer discounts for larger purchases , so i create a promo code for you ( and anyone else reading this ) . at check out , type in tendozen and we you receive 10 % any order of 10 dozen or more napkins . i hope this helps . thank you for considering these . russell 
i do offer promos for larger purchases . please contact me by clicking through to the `` contact seller '' button and reach out to me directly . thank you for your interest . russell basch 
they do not have a tag on them and i can not see anywhere that may indicate they were made in china . i am pleased with the ones i purchased . 
yes perfect for monogram 
i do n't have a swatch , but i sell these in packs of 4 napkins or if you email me i will send you one napkin . additionally , you can buy them through amazon prime and if they are not to your liking you an return them . they are very nice fabric . for a larger heavier napkin , i am also selling satin band napkins on amazon . 
these exact napkins are sold to restaurants and catering facilities , so they can withstand many washings in a commercial laundry . because these are 100 % cotton , they will look good screen printed . also check out the 100 % cotton satin band napkins that american linen is selling on amazon . they are about the same price for a dozen , but they are bigger 22 '' x22 '' . they do not have the `` linen '' look , but are elegant nonetheless . 
these will ship within a day of the order . if i am fulfilling them , they will come from virginia so they will be delivered in 1-5 days . if amazon is fulfilling them ( which will be the case soon ) , they will get there in 2 days if you have prime . - russell 
normal for numbers to remain visible and stationary when not in use . only way they disappear is when battery is removed . if you return to zeros after each use ( by simultaneously pushing left two buttons ) timer may look more `` normal '' and `` ready-for-use '' to your eye . 
no sorry , it can countdown from a maximum of 99 minutes and 59 seconds . if we included hours on the timer the digits would need to be much smaller and based on feedback the size of the digits was more important that counting down from 2+ hours . 
it keeps beeping for a few seconds , perhaps 15 - 30 , i have never counted . once it beeps and finally stops , it does not beep again as a reminder . 
2 3 4 '' x 3 '' 
i do n't know about the 30 second time ... .but when i use mine for a 30 minute time it will set itself for another 30 minutes ' 
unfortunately , the only way to stop the audible alarm is when the timer reaches zero . there is no mute button . the alarm only sounds in the count-down mode . you ca n't make the alarm beep after a specified amount of time when it 's in the `` stopwatch '' mode . 
correct , this line of cookware is made of 18 10 stainless steel ! 
this set is induction compatible , it works on all types of induction cooktops including nuwave . 
no , i always heat up first if sauting then add oil ... . nothing sticks . i love the set ! 
yes , you can wash them with brillo pads . the pots and pans are made of very high quality stainless steel . 
package dimensions : 29.4 x 15.6 x 9.1 inches . unit weight : 19 pounds . hope this helps . 
only the trivit is black . the pans are stainless steel . 
china 
no they do not . 
i have a glass top range and it works great with the cookware . 
because the duxtop cookware contains ferromagnetic materials - in other words , it contains iron , or has a layer with magnetic properties . an easy way to tell whether a cookware is induction capable is to contact it with a magnet . if it does n't attract the magnet , it is not induction capable . 
hi sandie . these are 16 ounces capacity . measurement is without lid , filled to top . hope this helps ! 
i do n't have a tervis straw to measure its diameter , but as long as the outside diameter is smaller than 6 16 '' ( i measured the opening at 6 16 '' ) you should be fine . 
it is always open . i find it travels well , if you fill it to a max of 1 4 '' below the line of the top , i 've had no spilling issues driving with it or carrying it around . 
cups and lids . solid quality . 
they are 6 '' tall & they do hold 16oz if you fill to the brim -- with the tops they are great for a sick person -- we love them ! 
yes ! i love them ! 
yes . we live in fl with high humidity and these are the glasses we use everyday 
the hole is triangular and about finger-sized ( 1 2 inch wide and 1 4 inch high or so ) . i would think you could drink a thick smoothie out of it , but not sure . there 's a pin-sized hole on the opposite side to allow airflow . 
plastic 
acrylic plastic . very heavy though . study product . 
yes absolutely . 
it should definitely take less time than that . does steam release when you press the trigger ? please contact pyle technical support support @ pyleaudio.com if you are unable to get the unit to work for you . 
i had difficulty getting enough steam built up to get rid of soap buildup . it seems a bit underpowered . hope this helps . 
it will take 6 ~8 minute to empty the a container of water ( about 280ml ) if steam continously 
it goes on the wide nozzle head . 
hmm . i have not used my steamer on concrete . concrete is pitted . what is ever in it.. needs a chemical to pull it out ... or a lot of water . the steamer does n't emit large quantities of water . i would first try something to neutralize the urine . look for a pet related product . ** # 1 pet odor eliminator ** urine remover - cri certified enzyme cleaner for old & new stains - free bonus included ... by petseer amazon sells this . it is an enzyme ... so not a harmful substance . as i stated earlier , i think a lot of water is needed to wash the urine away . best to you - s . 
it depends on the surface . if its a non-porous hard surface it will definitely loosen it up so that you can remove by wiping , scrubbing or scraping it away . it may take several rounds of steam then scrub depending on how much mold there is ... but it 'll eventually do the trick . in terms of killing it ... i guess if youre able to remove it then killing it is of less consequence ... .but once the surface is clean , some vinegar and some steam will thoroughly clean whatever microscopic bits remain . keep in mind this is a light duty appliance . if you 're talking about the bath tub or a utility sink , then this is perfect ... .but if you 're talking about a major project - you 'll want to get something else . if your surface is soft or porous then you 'll need more than just a steamer . you 'd be better off with one of those wet vacs that makes hot steam . the thing about mold is that there 's really no point to killing it . mold spores that are `` dead '' are just as harmful as those that are `` alive . '' the only solution is total removal . i have personally used this to clean up a moldy old car ... i used it on hard and soft surfaces in the car . i also used a hot steam wet vac on all porous surfaces ... it took me several days to complete the job and if i had to do it over again i would buy something more industrial ... .but for general housekeeping this thing is great . in response to the person who said it was n't powerful ... .this is not a pressure washer . it simply produces hot steam . it was never intended to produce a powerful blast of pressure . the washing cleaning must be done by you , with elbow grease . if you want a pressure washer then this is not it . lastly , i 'm sure you know this , but please be sure to wear a mask and gloves anytime you work with mold ... especially if you 're kicking it up with steam . good luck 
1 2 hour 
it works pretty good on clothes . it does not have enough spray pressure to do the deep cleaning i wanted to do with grout . 
yes 
yes , i threw it right into the wash with towels or jeans . it washes up well , once after a big day with grandchildren , i used a spray stain remover on it . it came out great . i did not put it in the dryer but laid it flat to dry . 
the steam comes on as long as you have water in the machine . you do n't have to do a `` cool down '' to continue . a well thought out item . only wish the power cord was longer . 
it has a cord only 110volt power cord length : 16.5 ft it is not battery powered 
no 
not terribly noisy . you 'll be able to hear it from another room but not to the point where it would interfere with you . 
yes . 
i 've used it on ours in the kitchen . it cleans the surface well . i just keep it away from any edges that are loose . since it uses water steam , it could get underneath and cause it to bubble up . 
it comes with 2 pads . they are reusable . you can get a few uses out of them between washes . i use mine every day and wash pads once a week . 
the broom in the front is rotating and pick up dust . so no need to sweep first . but the broom will not get to the edge . 
this is powered with a 110 volt power chord 
my tape measure says 31 3 4 '' at the highest part . that is from the floor ( with castors ) to the tallest part of the handles . it is a stanley tape measure so i assume it is correct . i see others have said 31.5 and 31 3 8. i was trying to be generous so the handles would not scrape your countertop . 31 3 4 '' is generous . 
the tag inside of each bag states `` 100 % polyester '' and that they are able to be hand-washed in cold water , so i doubt they are water-resistant but i can not say for certain . they are a very sturdy fabric , not `` slouchy '' , and well made so they hold their shape well while still being pliable . they feel like a medium-heavy canvas . personally , i am very pleased with this piece , as well as the customer service from deco brothers . 
yes , the bags can be removed . they hang on the frame with metal supports that are removable . this is good so you can launder them when they need it . 
9x14x22 
no i do n't think that would be a problem , you can always turn the wheel so that the lock is toward the inside of the cart ... . 
they should be machine washable , they are made of canvas material , so they should wash alright . i would use a gentle cycle on the washing machine . 
the frame itself measured from the top is about 30-3 4 '' . with wheels turned out it is about 34-1 2 '' but wheels can be turned toward the inside to save space . the bottom frame with wheels turned inward is more like 31 '' with the adjustment for wheel attachment . hope this helps if space is at a premium . 
no - it does n't fold . 
the wheels screw into the bottom of the frame using a bolt integrated into the caster . without the wheels , i believe the frame would sit flat on the floor just fine , so i think not attaching the wheels would be an option . 
very easy to roll and move around . if your 6'6 '' you 'll need to bend over to move this . ok here then that you 'll have no problem . 
hello , the hook to the top of the rod part is 4inches . at the base of hook to vertical rod ( the top of the rod part to end length ) is approx . 31inches . the horizonal bar can be placed anywhere along the 31inches ( there are two plastic clips that the horizontal bar will use as grip ) . if you put the horizontal bar on the last inch -you can fit up to 30inches above the horizontal bar . with that said-i would definitely hang the lighter clothes on the horizontal bar ( bottom ) cause the plastic clips do slide a little and can not hold a lot of weight ( definitely not alot of weight the wider you set it ) . hope this helps ! 
about 23 inches . 
yes the horizontal rod can be adjusted vertically . i have it up about half way for my daughters clothes but would put it all the way down for my husbands suits . max width is about 31 '' . minimum width is about half that- maybe 16 '' but i will measure it and get back to you . 
they are 2 '' hope this helps . 
i have all my cloths on it and probably 30-50 pieces . each one , top and bottom pole holds probably 50 each . i love mine and made my closet so organized . very sturdy.. remember there is 2 poles , top and bottom , so you double the space . 
i 'm assuming you mean like a rolling rack ? if so , absolutely could . 
it states 31 inches but i only adjusted my to 24 inches 
yes 
if you can hang a regular hanger on your rod , you will be fine with this product . it measures 1.5 '' ( as a regular hanger ) 
vertical bars are approx 3 4 '' in diameter . same for the one horizontal bar . 
yes , the nutribullet comes with a user guide and a recipe book 
no , not at all 
it comes with 3 cups ... 2 cups are about 1 c. each and one is larger with about a 2 c. capacity . it comes with a cup handle to put on a cup if you want to use it drink out of . it comes with a couple of lids if you want to save some for later or take it with you . it comes with drinking rings to put around the cup if you want to drink out of it and have a smooth surface for your lips . it 's well worth it . i have used it every day since i got it ! ! 
i suspect those who answered you 'd be able to pack little else were thinking a small carry-on bag . the motor is appx 8 inches high and 5 inches in diameter . the largest container is slightly smaller . so , yes , you can pack this and plenty more in a checked bag . 
no ... only 110 
hi there ... . we work with kohl 's on their wholesale loads and currently have many of both types in stock ... we did check to make sure and these are not interchangeable thanks for the question dj partin powerhouse liquidators 
if it leaks , you have over filled it . read the directions . also , taking the rubber seal out , rinsing it , and fitting it back in will help as well . there is a max fill line . no liquids over the line . its a great machine . i flipping love mine . 
operating voltage is 110 volts . 
yes , it does crush ice 
plastic . with screw on lids . and a cup holder . would recommend the item . more easy to clean than a blender . 
you raise a good point , although do n't you mean anaerobic bacteria like botulism ? the thing is , clostridium botulinum is dangerous in foods which are either too high of a ph ( like green beans ) or which have n't been cooked at high enough temperature ( greater than 185 degrees fahrenheit for at least 5 minutes ) . whether this product will do that i ca n't say - unfortunately i have n't had a chance to use it yet because just recently i finally gave up on receiving the converter from them and went on amazon and bought it myself . i personally would n't worry about botulism with this device , especially since the vacuum will ( theoretically , at least ) raise the boiling point of water high enough to heat the steam to at least 212 degrees fahrenheit . 
there should already be an english user manual inside the box . it is a small fold out manual . 
do n't even bother about buy this item , it wo n't keep your food hot , unless is plugged . 
is not for cooking , is for heating 
i think it 's just regular plastic since it did n't say , so i do n't think it 's bpa free . 
hi , please mail us , we will get your order id , and we 'll ship the adopter to you . 
you do n't need to buy a converter because it is already 110v voltage . 
it 's 110v.it 's designed for us , do n't worry about the voltage , it can be used in us and canada . 
hi , we 've prepared the adapter in most of the lunch jar , usually you could get it , if you have n't got one , please mail us , we 'll ship one to you as soon as we get the mail . 
hi , it 's three vertical prongs , it can be used with a wiring board , if you need , we 'll also send a usa adaptor to you , it can be used in many other countries . 
this model does not shut off on its own . we are looking at bringing in another model next fall that will have a 30 minute timer on it . batteries will last hundreds of hours . please let me know if you have other questions . thank you , sunbelt products 
hello , this is not machine washable . you would need to spot clean the blanket . we do have a full 90 day warranty though . if you spill something on your blanket or it stops working , it can be sent back to us for a free replacement . thank you , sunbelt products 
i 'm not sure , but it def was n't what i was expecting either and i hate you ca n't wash it . : - ( 
hi isabella , our blanket is spot wash only and can not be put into a washer . thanks ! sunbelt products 
they will hold 8oz . each . 
i 'm not concerned about the material . it feels and looks like what you would expect from stoneware . if you think about ceramic bowls with the handle that some restaurants use to serve french onion soup , you 'll understand why it is non-stick . stoneware is basically a ceramic ( i.e. , earthenware ) that is fired at a much higher temperature . so , it is suitable for use in a microwave ( all ceramics can not be put in a microwave ) . get yourself a set ... you wo n't regret it ! 
it comes with a small booklet with eighteen 5 minute recipes , no pictures just recipes . poached eggs , egg omelet , baked apple crisp dessert , the baked onion trick , french onion soup , fresh tomato sauce , shrimp scampi , chocolate souffle , maple sweet potatoes , eggplant parmesan , healthy veggie chili , loaded diced potato , broccoli garlic saute , green bean almondine , spicy sesame green beans , honey glazed carrots , zucchini and tomato saute and , baked banana dessert . fyi , after using it a couple of times , they spend most of the time on the shelf . 
like so many things today , they are made in china according to the box . 
yes . each one of them comes with a separate book . 
hi thanks for your comment . please send me your address details and i will send you the lid . reg . 
dear ladym we do n't have the certificate to prove it is bpa free thank you for your question home value 
dear d.j the size of this jar : ( l ) 6 1 2 * ( w ) 6 1 2 * ( h ) 9 1 2 any other questions please feel free to send to us thank you , have a good day home value 
it would core it while it spiral sliced and peeled it . i think that would be a waste of a lot of zucchini since it does n't need to be cored ! there 's no way to avoid coring 
i do n't know if it 's cast iron or not , but it 's not heavy at all . i can pick it up easily with 1 hand . it 's not a big bulky item either & can be stored easily in a cabinet or deep drawer . i love it ! cores , peels , & slices all at once ! wish i 'd had it years ago ! 
no you can not adjust the width because the curved , horseshoe shaped blade is just one size , about 1 4 '' . 
i do n't have the measurements for you as it was a gift , but i did try it out and it wo n't do large potatoes unless you cut them maybe in half , but is does a nice job and the core is spiraled which i find very interesting when you want fries ... .. 
i just checked mine , and on mine the blade that slices is adjustable . it can be moved out of the way , so that you only peel and core . you will always core , the coring is part of the frame . so if you did a potato , it would core it . we make sliced apples ( similar to famous dave 's apples ) all the time using this , and it works awesome . can core , peel , and slice a full apple in about 10 to 15 seconds . 
yes , it will core and slice without peeling . 
no . not since i 've been using it . 
no i do n't think you can . 
no . or at least i have n't figured out how to do so . 
i have not , but would be very interested in same information . 
it comes with a 3m adhesive hook or a screw in dry wall hook . we bought a sturdier hook at a local hardware store just to be safe since we placed over our babies crib . 
yes . this thing is super light . however , if the lace gets sat on , and thus pulled , that hook likely would n't hold up . the one it comes with did pretty good as long as you mount in a stud . 
they come in several colors , do n't know about the description . 
it didnt say . i have to say though i was sewing butterflies on the netting and the thread could get lost . it looks great and doesnt seem large but again i did have difficulty getting those butterflies to stay . i hope this helps somewhat . 
i am using it in full but sure it would fit in queen also . 
just measured the one in my daughters room . hanging up from the start of the material at the hook on the ceiling to the end on the floor it is about 10ft . give or take maybe an inch at most . i have it over a twin bed and she still has a little over a foot of material on the floor , which usually gets tucked in . not sure if that helps . 
yes , it will fit around a king bed . no , there is no hardware . i bought a white screw-in hook to mount on my white ceiling and it worked nicely . when i take the housweety down for the winter , the hook in the ceiling is barely noticeable . 
yes 
although this is delicate i think you could hand wash in woolite probably a quick swish is all . 
yes it does . i have around only the top of my daughters bed . she loves it ! 
yes . just released in march . 
accrding to my bathroom scales it weighs just under 17 lbs 
the dyson dc65 animal complete . i have the first dyson vac ever made and still love it but i was visiting a friend and they had the newer one with the ball . what a difference , so easy to maneuver . since i have two cats i decided to get the new dc65 . it is great , pics up hair like nothing and the attachments are great for upholstery . we keep the original one upstairs and use the new one downstairs . no more carrying the vac up and down the stairs . 
no it is a light machine . my wife loves it . she has back issues so it was important to find a great machine like this . 
this question made me curious , i was n't sure so i got the dyson out of the closet and weighed it on my bathroom scale . with an empty dirt canister and the cord wound it came in at 15.5 lbs . fyi , i 'm 70 years old and i can honestly tell you that this is the easiest to use and most efficient vacuum i 've ever used . it 's not a lightweight but the ball makes it so agile that i do n't have any problem with the weight . 
no it is easy to push around and on carpet it pulls it self forward with the floor brush turned on . 
i have n't noticed any marks , but i have a low nap carpet ... 
the picture makes the cup looks smaller than it is . i do empty the cup everytime i vacuum because i have a 90 lb double-coated dog who sheds like crazy . 
hi.. i purchased the dysonc65 this past summer . i wanted needed a vacuum that performed better and outlasted my previous 2 vacuums . after lots of research thru independent review websites , i decided to purchase the dysonc65 vacuum ! i bought it thru amazon.com and it did include a 5-year warranty ! i have three area rugs , none of mine are loose weave . the first time i vacuumed with the dyson , my rugs were not only debris free , the very unexpected surprise was the carpets looked cleaner , brighter , colors more vivid . that was a very happy feeling . i stood there looking at my rugs kinda shocked . then looked at the canister and saw how quickly it filled up ! it was getting out actual deep dirt , that my previous vacuum were n't powerful enough to pick up . there is no other explanation . the rest of our home is either hardwood , or stone . we have no carpeting at all . the dyson is not cheap ! i too had questions and wanted to know if this would be a good investment . so far , i say , yes , definitely . we have two dogs.. one with a double coat . he sheds so much . he is a dear sweet thing so either sweeping or vacuuming up after him is worth having him in our family . i hope my experience with the dysonc65 helps you decide ! jan cappell - royal oak , mi 
yes . the actual device is identical . 
no , it 's not . 
yes . just like all of the dysons it pulls out of the handle . 
see this link : 
great question ! i have plush carpets in my home including a rug with almost 2 inch pile . it works wonderfully on my thick carpet . it has no problem gliding across it and pulling up all the dirt and hair . i was most impressed by the fact that it worked awesome on my rug . because the rug is so thick , there 's going to be some resistance , but it is the first vacuum that could handle moving across the rug without the beaters getting tangled in a pile . when comparing my other vacuums it seems that the bristles on the beater are shorter which is why it works so well in carpets like this . definitely worth it . 
yes it 's just the color and extra tools . 
the models are basically the same . the only difference is you get more `` extension '' tools with the animal . 
i have 3 cats and a dog ... the dc65 multi floor picks up pet hair fabulously ! ... amazing..i also use a hair remover brush thingy ( lol ) for blankets and furniture ... $ 5 compared to the pet attachment.. 
i find the ball is easier , and turns much more easily , but it requires a different `` feel '' for steering . once you `` get it '' , you 'll never go back to traditional four-wheel system . 
no there is not . it has a flexable hose but not a flexable attachment . i do not recommend this vac . it is terrible . there are much better options at much much better prices . my bissell works 10 times better as does my orek . i was also recommended this which is much less : $ 79 : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00azbiztw ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 good luck . 
16 pounds + - 1 
the dc65 weighs 19 pounds . 
no . this is 110v . 
i 'm not sure , however this version came with everything you would probably need . we did n't even bother considering keeping any of the attachments from our old dyson . 
it has an upholstery brush attachment , but i do think the suction would be too strong for draperies . hope this helps . 
no . 
the color and the animal comes with two additional attachments : a dyson tangle free turbine and a dyson soft dusting brush . http : www.amazon.com dyson-tangle-free-tool-turbine dp b008sh85j0 http : www.amazon.com dyson-49-soft-dusting-brush dp b000anhpiw 
emptying the canister is only messy if you hold it above the garbage instead if lowing it into the garbage . this is my second canister dyson vacuum & i would never go back to bags . with the dc65 the filter needs to be cleaned every 3 months . this might seem quite often but that is just because it picks up so much dirt . 
no . there are no filters to replace . you simply wash the filters every month or two ( what ever dyson recommends ) and let them dry over night . 
it shouldnt ( we dont have laminate floors ) ; you can shut of the beater bar when on floors other than carpet 
it will not fit under the bed , just use the wand part . i do love this vac as i had a kirby before this one . 
hi , the manufacturer recommends not exceeding 250 lbs total weight on the frame . 
yes , i have plastic bins under it . thin ones as the clearance is not too high 
our twin trundle fits under the twin daybed . 
the full size nomad frame actually has a weight capacity of 500 lbs ( not 1000 ) but it has 2 middle support rails which the daybed frame does not have . the recommended weight limit for the mission daybed frame is 250 lbs . 
the manufacturer does not make custom orders . you can replicate something similar by ordering 1 xl-twin nomad frame and 2 charleston headboards . the headboards are not available on amazon , but you can find them with a google search for `` shop4futons '' . look in the accessories section . 
product dimensions : 76.5 x 40 inches , platform height=15 inches , arm height=32 inches 
i would say 2-3 inches.. let 's put it this way.. i felt i needed to get a box spring.. or at least have a board on the bottom of the mattress with no box spring . i opted for the box spring ( on sale , dirt cheap , at bjs.. ) 
most orders ship out within one business day . time in transit to md is 2-3 business days . 
our twin trundle frame will fit . here is a link : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00kya1l7w 
they need to ship in separate boxes ( too large to combine ) , so unfortunately there is no combined shipping discount . sorry about that . 
line up legs with holes in chair . place black plastic things between legs and chair top . screw in . cover screws with black tips , 
pretty standard . seat is curved - 17 '' in middle to 19 '' on sides . 
they are if you 're wearing jeans or thick pant , but any longer than a typical dinner and you might want to invest in some chair pads ( which i did - i only use them when i know we 're going to be sitting for longer than an hour ) . i get so many compliments on these chairs ! ! 
i just went to try and stack them to see..they arent stackable . 
i did n't get instructions either ! amazon had me contact the manufacturer and they did n't respond . they were ok to assemble , look at the screw holes , in the front of the seat they are closer together than in the back . do n't fully tighten the screws until you have all 4 in . good luck ! 
its very simple , common sense really to assemble , however it is very difficult because they do n't line up properly ... 
per the manual , i remember the number 200 lbs , though i believe some heavier people have used them at our h ouse . 
i 'm not sure what the weight limit is . if we would 've been able to get the chairs put together , we 'd have tested them out . the holes in the base made it impossible for them to be assembled . we returned them . : ( 
mine do n't stack either . i bought 2 from woot.com that look identical and they do stack . i also had the same problem as many others with the bolts going into the nuts like they should . they do n't line up . i do n't know how to fix that problem . 
probably . i would be a little worried about the metal legs if they were in the rain , though . 
they are large - 25 '' x 15 '' , with a loop in one corner for easy hanging drying . 
these are a large 25 '' x 15 '' , with a small loop in one corner for easy hanging and drying . 
they did n't shrink too much when i washed them , before i embroidered them . i do plan on ordering more . 
crayon red 
hello ! at this moment we do not . we do have single color 6 packs of just red , green or blue if you 'd like to get a specific color vs a multiple color pack ! you can see them here http : www.amazon.com kitchen-towels-vintage-absorbent-natural dp b00jql8wcc ref=sr_1_4 ? s=home-garden & ie=utf8 & qid=1431619769 & sr=1-4 & keywords=kitchen+towels 
i do n't really think it matters . i 've used regular tide liquid detergent , tide pods and gain flings . all did a great job at removing stains ( although i think i prefer tide pods ) . hope this helps ! 
sure , very nice and well made-they 're retro . 
no 
i have done a lot of research into that , they are made by a company called aunt martha 's although they all come with a tag 100 % cotton , made in india . now i am not sure if the cotton is grown and milled there or if they actually make the towels . they are well made and very durable when used and washed . i myself have been trying to find where i can get them wholesale rather than retail , cost is killing me , lots of work and little profit embroidering them . but have n't had any luck finding anyone but amazon who sells them cheep enough . there is another company that sells wholesale towels called hoffmen but they sell only terry cloth and the few that are not are linen only . 
i would use the cheesecloth , it 's a finer weave , thinner and will probably to a better job for you . 
agree with mike h. the slats were just a hair too short . my husband ( weight : 240 ) laid on his side and a few of the slats instantly fell out . for me ( weight : 120 ) , it was fine but i was a bit hesitant at first . now that we 've had the bed for about a month , so far so good . overall , the structure of the bed is sturdy and feels sturdy . 
softwood has some metal brackets 
no there tends to be a small amount of space on each side . 
yes it does , and also you do n't need a box spring for it either . i 'm pretty happy with it . 
yes this comes unassembled . it is usually used with just a good mattress but no springs . 
yes it does . 
it 's a medium gray . 
no 
no , it comes in boxes and was left when i was n't home . delivered via ups or fedex , do n't remember which one . 
5 inches 
the actual mirror is 9.5 inches wide , by 42 inches tall . the entire cabinet stands 57 inches tall , and is 16 inches across . you did n't ask this , but i 'll offer it up -- i totally love this cabinet . so easy to assemble , and a perfect and classy display for all my jewelry ! 
yes it does 
very good 
they 're functional but very shallow , they are very easy to pull completely out . but they slide right back in . 
yes it does . i absolutely love it ! i highly recommend getting one . 
glass i do n't think it can be plastic 
yes this is best for hook earrings 
no 
yes there is lipped ledges and drawers 
i ca n't say for sure but my gf does have a ton of jewelry in there . 
there is not a rubber seal on these tins . 
21 oz is liquid volume . each tea has different kind texture . example some teas are kinda whole leaves such as ceylan tea , green tea . some of them has very small leaves such as turkish tea . so the weight of the tea will be depend of the leaves . if your tea has big leaves it may hold less than 5 oz , if the leaves are small you can go up to 7-8 oz . there is a easy way to understand how much this tins will hold though . do you have any measurement cup with fl oz written on it . find the 21 oz and fill to that line your tea . this tin will hold exactly that much tea . 
sorry - we do not . 
near as i can tell , they are made of tin , as stated in the product description . 
approximately 21 oz . 
hello dawn , they do hold 21 fluid oz . ( i.e . liquid ) . however , if you plan to use them for other type of content with a greater density , such as tea leaves , ground coffee , etc . then you 're right it will hold less . since other contents besides liquid differ on density , fluid ounces is normally used to describe the capacity of a container . hope i answered your question . eddie g. perfume trader amazon 
each seller has different shipping policy . if you buy them from our store i sir can the s & h is $ 3.49 and you 'll get them in 2-3 business days . 
mine was black love it 
13 in wide 12 inch long 3 inches tall 
dimensions state 2.9 inches . 
you could stack them , but the drawer does n't open very smoothly so you would run the risk of having the top one slide off - i would probably use some epoxy glue to permanently attach the two together . 
hi there . thank you for asking this question . the top of the k-cup drawer is made of metal and does not have any padding ; however we have been using the happy toucan k-cup drawer for a long time now with a large keurig brewer on top and have not experienced any vibration problems or other problems at all when brewing our coffee . the metal is solid and very sturdy . 
hi nick , thank you for your question . the happy toucan drawer is designed for k-cups and capsules that range from 45 to 50 mm in height . we would n't recommend our drawer for the pads since what separates each row of the drawer is a bar and not a solid divider . if you also use capsules then they should work . thanks for your inquire and please let us know if you have any other questions . 
minus the frame , the actual mirror glass is approximately 9 1 2 '' wide . 
well constructed no spray on flocking small padded area on top for rings and pins . 
i suppose you could hang the ties on the spot for the necklaces . but i do n't think sunglasses would fit anywhere . it 's really designed for different types of jewerly . 
since the back is wood i imagine you can put them anywhere although the unit is very heavy 
it is good quality and heavy . 
on the regular hook , probably 28 '' . i have a lariat i hand on the right side and it 's 48 '' . it lays in front of my bracelets . 
i believe so . the door appears to have a magnetic latch . 
yes you can 
facing the cabinet the hinges are on the left . it can be mounted on the wall . i absolutely love this jewelry case . 
if supported either on the bottom or screwed in from the sides , i 'd think so - it 's not that heavy on it 's own , but full would be . just leave room for the door to swing open fully . hope that helps . 
i do n't think so . they 're very thin and lightweight . either tin or aluminum . 
they are very well made with a silicon rubber seal on the push on lids . while not super expensive , they also were not as large as i was thinking they 'd be as the add says 16 ounce canister . so i thought that meant they would each hold 16 ounces of product , in my case loose tea as i 'd bought several bags of the davidson bulk teas of various varieties . they only hold a few ounces per can but they are air tight and are easily refillable . look nice too ! 
16 oz are fluid ounces ( i.e. , liquid ) . usually holds about half in tea leaves , 8-9 oz . 
about 2 1 2 inches in dm 
negative , these tins have 1 metal lid with a plastic lining that inserts into the top of the tin . they stay on decently well because of this plastic seal . 
pop on 
never used teavana but the lid fits very tightly . there is a 1 4 inch rim of soft , pliable plastic on the lid that snugly fits inside the body of the canister . 
hi ms. coggin , the free shipping is belongs to general discount store . we do charge $ 3.49 s & h for 3 of them . we 're different store than them but selling exactly same item . i hope it answer your question . if you need any other help please free . best nellie 
no , no recipe and no instructions 
they claim a lifetime warranty . 
no mine did not come with instructions , i had to youtube it . : ) lots of great tutorials and recipes on there . 
mine came without instructions . seems to be the norm . but the blades in slots under the sliding mechanism . there should be three blades total . one attached and two stored under the machine . 
if you want to slice the potato into coins , i do n't think this is what you want . it makes spirals and curlicues . 
you pull it out in the same time you push the secure line below the blade ... hard to explain jajaj hope it was clear 
i 've only used it to make zoodles . i do n't think it can be used for parking veggies . 
the ability to heat just milk , for one . ability to dispense hot water . larger milk , water and spent pod reservoirs . led display . you are prompted to clean the milk receptacle . a 'ristretto ' setting ( very small amount of espresso ) . i have both and use both every morning when preparing lattes for my husband any myself . no need to have two , but i 'm keeping the plus as a back-up . the pro drew me in with the milk and water settings . i like just steamed milk occasionally ( much better steamed than from the aeroccino ) , and my husband enjoys tea , so it is nice to have the hot water setting . and to be honest , i just like a little coffee with my milk , so i am often adding more milk than the latte setting provides ( yes , i do realize i can customize that output on both machines , but not everybody feels the same as i do about milk qty ) . very sturdy machine . more sleek than the plus . and when i say milk , i mean coconut flavored almond milk . the primary reason i purchased a nespresso machine in april 2013 was to have lattes with non-dairy and non-soy options . at the time , last april , starbucks and peets did not offer almond milk . peets now does , but they do n't have coconut flavored - it makes all the difference . 
a caffe lungo , also known as a long coffee or caffe americano , is an espresso with double water and comes pretty close to what we yanks call coffee . caffee lungo is one of the choices on this machine . 
no . it 's much better . i had a sbux one today because i got a gift card and i waited 10 minutes for an inferior drink . the sbux espresso is not even in the same league . pa 
110 
i can answer the first two -- yes , milk container stores well in fridge , and coffee temp is hot enough . do n't have a plus so do n't know how the programming compares -- you can adjust the volumes of coffee espresso dispensed . includes the machine , the milk jug , a sample pack of a few nespresso pods , and an attachment for hot water in place of the milk jug . 
yes , by tapping he milk contron button , you can stop the process of adding milk at any point . you can also program the buttons any way that you like . 
no idea 
as far as the size the unit is totally customizable as far as the sizes . and as far as the capsule i 'm still working thru a 200 pc selection i was given , so i not sure yet . this unit is very good . 
i use unsweetened almond milk almost exclusively and it works great ! 
i apologize for not giving a more clear answer . i 've never had coffee from a vertuoline so i ca n't comment on it . but i 've made close to one hundred lattes on my de'longhi machine and have been happy with the temperature of coffee and milk with every cup . i have n't ever measured the temperature of the espresso and steamed milk made from my machine . and i do n't own a thermometer to do it -- or i would measure it and give you the results . but i drink several lattes each week -- and sometimes each day -- from starbucks , dunkin donuts , etc. , and the temperature of the milk and espresso made by my machine seems to be the same -- if not very close -- to those . 
it is a little hard to pour from if you 're trying to hold the glass in one hand and pour with the other . i have big hands and i can barely manage to do it . condensation also becomes an issue though because it makes it slick . 
no sharp edges . it 's well made 
just rinse it out really well with hot water immediately after finishing the beer . the person filling will rinse it again when you go for a refill . 
no attachments are required . lid is included . 
holds 64oz . the longest i have kept beer in it is 3 weeks . once you pop the top use in 2 - 3 days . 
i do n't know . i have seen standard koozies that work for glass & steel for normal shapes . i would be interested to know as well . 
hi , not that we 're aware of but we will check with the manufacturer and let you know . thanks , lloyd at ed 's broadway 
the opening looks like it might be 1 '' fpt . 
hi george , our growlers are not compatible with other dispenser caps . 
it 's a full size growler ( although , it does n't look like it ) so half a gallon . 
yes , the memory preset handset and all electrical components are included . you just need to supply the table top . 
thanks for asking , and sorry for the confusion . the telescoping bar *is* included , however a table top is not included . we 're sorry for the confusion on that line , we will make an edit so that it 's more clear . please let us know if you have any other questions . 
the telescoping frame collapses down to 42.5 '' , so a 43.25 '' wide top would work . and 26.375 '' on the depth would be no trouble . so , yes this size table top will work . 
this is the latest version of jarvis with the offset c-style legs and updated led control . 
this is a case where pictures help a lot . http : bit.ly 1iv441c http : bit.ly 1lnxwri there are screws that go into the desktop from underneath that include longer ones from the left-right braces and shorter ones from the arms on the left and right . the instructions clearly tell you to do this all upside-down , with the desktop on the ground face down . i did n't do that , because i did n't have room for it , and it was very , very difficult , but it would have been very easy if i followed directions . 
hello . the black frames are enroute to amazon and we expect them to become available within the next 5 business days . 
i 'm not sure exactly , but i called the manufacturer directly and they helped troubleshoot when my screen was displaying something different . they ended up shipping me a replacement part as there is a 5yr manufacturer warranty . great customer service . 
there is a full five year warranty on all parts - including the motor .

hi vero ! great question . yes they will make it in a 460f oven temperature under normal use with a couple of points to keep in mind . we tested our mats at higher temperatures than 480f which is why we felt confident rating them at a top heat resistance of 480f . that being said , if you use them as an oven liner even at a temperature lower than 460f they will become damaged because they will be too close to the heating element of most stoves . also , if the food you are cooking on them burns ( for any reason food may normally burn in the oven ) the mats will be damaged even if the temperature was below 460f . i hope this answers your question ! 
the mats are made in china and pass all food and drug administration regulations by undergoing a commodities check before they are allowed into the united states . 
hi sheila . great question . the mat is smooth . the back side is shiny which keeps it from moving around on your counter top . the top side that has the markings on it is a `` matte '' finish and the markings are smooth so if you gently run your finger across the mat you will feel a textural difference , but no ridges . if you were to roll out your pastry or dough on the mat and then flip the pastry over to inspect the side that was against the mat , you would not see any lines from the measurement markings . and if you happen to have a tile counter top that makes it almost impossible to roll out pastry smoothly , you will find that the pastry mat will allow you to roll out your pastry and not see any of those grout lines in your dough either . when we did our testing , this was one of the issues that we most wanted to address ! i hope this answers your question ! 
there 's no fiberglass in this mat . it 's pure silicone . 
no odor at all . we are pleased with it after a month of use . 
the matt unroll just fine . the silicone stays put without water so far . 
the mat is rather soft for children 's activities . a kids plastic placemat would be a better alternative . 
its about 19 inches x 16 inches . a tiny bit more perhaps . 
i do n't know . but it is fairly light and i would think the water jets would blow it all over and get it tangled up . it is easy enough to clean and set in a strainer . 
it 's approximately 1 16 of an inch thick , and it is very sturdy . 
31 '' 1 2 height 
the minimum height is 24 inches from the floor to the seat 
you will get instructions and it 's pretty straight forward . i left the arm rests off , but they are simple to attach . 
i am 6'2 '' and weigh 280 # they handle me very well 
i purchased four of these several months ago . assembly was a breeze and the instructions were simple . they 've been used a lot and still look new . 
approximately 15 pounds 
the seat is 17 '' wide,15 '' deep and 3 '' thick . the back is 17 '' wide x 12 '' high and is 2 '' thick . the side arms are one unit assembly , removable , attached by two screws under the seat . the stool is comfortable and good looking . is 
all i remember is that the black pieces that look like caps are supposed to come off . i had to pry them off . 
i would not buy these if i were you . they are a lot smaller than they look and are junk . 
i 'm 6'1 and 205. it 's enough for me however while these are inexpensive the arm rests tend to break off after a couple of months . they are tack welded on the underside of the chair and not attached to the back of the chair . it happened to both the chairs i ordered . my opinion , if money is n't the main reason for buying this chair , i 'd buy something heavy duty for a man his size . if you are only using it very occasionally and not in a business environment it 'll probably work ( for a while ) . 
no , they just continue to look like new and are extremely absorbent ! i 'm so glad i purchased these ! 
they are almost as big as a beach towel . they are about 3 inches narrower and about 4 inches shorter than a typical beach towel . but they are much larger than a typical bath towel . 
no they do n't but they are great towels 
these are the closest i have found to a `` hotel '' type towel 
very . love these towel ! especially after the first wash . 
hello gregory , the dimensions are as follows : 55 x 27 inches we also carry this style robe is a bath sheet , the dimensions are 70 x 35 inches . if there is anything else we may assist you with , please feel free to contact us . 
when you say `` american cotton , '' you are being too general . there is one type of american cotton -- pima -- that compares favorably with turkish cotton . both have long , absorbent fibers that are necessary for a quality towel . according to `` google , '' only about 3 % of the cotton in the us is truly `` pima '' cotton . most of the cotton grown in the united states is a lower grade cotton . i 'm not an expert , but turkish cotton and pima cotton compare very well . just remember , not all towels that claim to be `` pima '' are from american cotton , and very few american cotton towels are 100 % pima . 
hi mary , according to the seller under description it reads 700+ gsm . i personally do n't know the gsm , but went by the seller 's information . hope this helps you . 
they are not thick at all . they would be perfect for children 's bathtime.nice towels . 
not sure . i found these towels do n't dry as well . they also are not as absorbent .

hi j. oden , thank you for your interest in the portable humidifier . regarding essential oils , our portable humidifier works best with only water-soluble essential oil . essential oil which is not water-soluble may cause our portable humidifier to experience issues , or even be damaged . if there 's anything else we can do for you , please do n't hesitate to contact us . we look forward to your feedback ! best regards , nancy deneve - co-founder 
idk but as long as there is a usb available you should be able to . i would call to make sure that it is not on some `` list '' of things you ca n't have on a plane . 
about 8 hours , maybe longer . the key is to have a wide , tall glass of water . 
i asked that same question a while back , and no one ever answered . i 'm responding here so i will be notified if anyone answers you ! 
yes 
its not rechargeable . it runs about 12 hours before it dies . very poor electronics and prone to rapid corrosion . 
you have to press the little switch . i do n't think it will work with a timer . 
no , i do n't think so . the product packaging says `` always use clean water . do not use any other type of liquid or aromatic oil '' . 
if you place it in a sturdy cup you should be able to , but i 'm not sure if the mist would get to bed height from the floor . 
no..i would n't use them for canning . the pink color would come off . i do n't know if they sell ones that you are looking for . 
they are regular mouth . 
these are glass . thanks for looking 
they are glass 
yes it does a good job for me . i open jumbo sized cans quite often for special recipes that require quantities of certain canned vegetables . the best help to get the larger cans opened smoothly are the excellent grip you can get on the stainless steel handles . go for it it works . 
they appear to all be stainless steel . the upper part ( `` plates '' that hold the gears and attach to the handles ) are kind of shiny for stainless and look like some kind of plated metal- they are shiny like chrome , and very solid . i do not see any evidence of rusting on the gears or anywhere after a few months of use . this device works great . 
chris , the handles as you see in the pic are separate and are joined to the oper part . this is a very efficient and easy to use hand can opener . also the turning piece is soft to use especially if you need it . it opens the with not effort . i highly recommended . i do not let anybody else use it ... it is mine ... : ) 
yes , it pierces the top of the can but it does it very close to the edge so that virtually no sharp edge is left on the can . the lid is removed and discarded and its edge is quite sharp . this is not a safe-edge opener such as the `` good cook classic 4 in 1 can opener '' . 
no 
i believe it is and it works great for me . 
i bought this for my elderly sister . she has arthritic hands and she told me she loves it . i have not used it myself , but i would definitely buy myself one on the strength of her recommendation . i hope this helps you . 
i do n't know for sure but it is my understanding bpa is associated with plastics and the keetzen stainless steel can opener is all metal so i personally would not worry about bpa with this device . 
i do not use my dishwasher ! after each use of this wonderful can opener , i just wipe it with my dishcloth , make sure it is dry , and put it away for another day . this is by far the best can opener i have ever used , including electric ones . 
well it 's made of stainless steel so it shouldn't.but i would wipe it dry after each use and it appears to be very sturdily made and should last for years with minimal care . my wife liked it so much she had me order a second one definetily head and shoulders above the ones we used years ago !

it 's the last measure you used before you turned the scale off . 
i can only say i store my scale on its side and it seems to be working fine 
yes . 
no 
there is a 60 day money back guarantee . if for any reason you are unhappy with our scale , let us know and we will refund your money , no hassle . 
this is a scale ... no timer . 
i believe so . . . the numbers are black , about 3 4 '' tall with a blue back light . 
yes 
the scale definitely has decimal points to one place . so , you can weigh something at 7.6 ounces for example . it would not round up to 8 , in this example . 
i 've never used the one you have , but this one is firm . it has memory foam and it is contoured . it stays firm too . i use it in my car everyday and i do notice a difference ; i 'm not shifting every few minutes to try and get comfortable . it helps take the pressure off the lumbar while sitting . hope this helped . 
the cushion is 18.2 inches wide . i wear a size 18 ( or 1x ) and its perfect for me ( all of me rests on the cushion ) . you might try it and return it if it does n't work for you . i just spent 3 days sitting on a couch without it , and mild sciatica and hemoroids immediately returned . so i know the cushion does help ! 
the handle is sewn on to right side of the cushion if you are sitting down or on the left if you are standing and looking at the chair . 
the coccyx hole cutout is approximately 4 inches wide and 5 inches in length . just the right size . hope this helps . lilly garcia 
i am using this cushion on my office chair . i sit all day and i 'm `` plus size '' . i do n't know exactly how long i 've had it ( at least 6 weeks ) and it has maintained a good level of firmness . it has added height ( slight lift ) . if you want guaranteed lift in height for a long drive , i would definitely say yes , it will hold up for a long drive . i am sorry , but ca n't give you a good guess on how much height you 'll gain . you 'll be pleased with the firmness holding up , but not sure it will give you the height in inches you are seeking since that depends on how low your car seat currently rests . 
no . cloth cover 
no , thr cushion is no waterproof . 
there is not much of a slope . i thought it would be too thick and put me too high to fit under the steering wheel but no , it works perfectly , still have room between top of legs and wheel . i am a plus size and drive a small nisson sentra . try it , if it does n't work , send it back . i am 100 % satisfied . although i just received it i drove over 200 miles this past weekend and no back pain . 
honestly , my opinion is no . a standard or memory pillow has work better for me the design makes it difficult to adjust too . 
yes 
this daybed fits a twin mattress . i also purchased a pop-up trundle for the space under the frame so that the bed could accommodate two adults when fully opened . i bought 2 twin mattresses , one for the top and one for the pop-up trundle . the mattresses were 38 in x 74 in x 6 in . i wanted the 6 in high mattress so that it would have a more comfortable feel that the thin 4 inch mattresses you tend to see on some models . i mention this height also because when fully outfitted with a mattress pad and sheets , the trundle is a snug fit when you put it back under the daybed . i remedied this by putting a double thickness cut to measure piece of brown self stick felt pad on the underside of each leg ( super sliders brand purchased at my local walmart ) . i bought the self-stick felt initially because of my hardwood floors , but soon realized that if i placed a double thickness under each leg post , then the trundle goes under the daybed with no trouble at all . the twin mattress on top also allows for whatever blanket or daybed cover you place on top to fit nicely between the mattress and the side rails . this is a very nice bed . i hope this explanation is helpful to you . 
it 's very sturdy and solid -- i 'd say it should n't have problems with 250 lbs . 
there is enough room . you just wo n't have as much side rail open afterwards 
i just put this together today and i would say the answer as to whether a standard twin bed skirt would work is `` no '' . a standard twin has skirt flaps on 3 sides ( 2 long and 1 short ) but the daybed needs 2 short sides and 1 long side . i measured from the top of the front slat support rail to the floor and it was 17 inches . the twin skirt that i happened to have is too short . i tried to make it work since you ca n't really see the left side of the bed so not having a flap over there would not matter and i tucked the other long side under the mattress . the problem is that trying to make it hang longer in the front makes the front corner too far forward . it also slides around to easily while you are trying to position the mattress . i think it is because of the smooth finish on the wood . i had a daybed years ago that had a metal spring frame as the support insead of wooden slats and rails and that made it easier to use a standard twin skirt . the spring frame attached to the wood frame at the corners only so there was space to let the skirt hang directly from over the edge of the spring frame . hope this helps . 
im not sure what is meant by ''full '' but yes , it is a twin size day bed and fits a standard twin mattress 
if i remember correctly , it was in a large flat box , about 75 '' x 40 `` x 4 or 5 '' . if you 've got muscles , it should be doable . read the instructions carefully ... i remember a false start . 
no 
there is a 13-1 2 '' floor-to-frame clearance 
there is a foot from bottom of bed to floor 
do you mean like it is in the product photo ? the rails hold the the slats that supports the mattress , it has to match otherwise it would n't work 
nope ! it is a standard off-the-shelf cartridge , available at home depot or wal-mart . i have already replaced the carbons once.hope this helps . 
i use it as a whole house filter and did n't notice any pressure drop . i 'm sure it will as the filter clogs , but nothing now . i only have 35 pounds and it seems the same as before . 
see here . ... for cartridges ... .. http : www.waterfiltersfast.com 5-micron-polyspun-sediment-filter-25-x-10_p_1960.html 
it is 18 '' from fitting to fitting , 13 '' from top of the mounting flange to the bottom of the filter housing , and 6 '' from the wall to end of mounting flange ( 6 '' deep ) and you can not find a better 3 filter setup ( could not find anything close for under $ 300.00 . 
the connections at the filter are 3 4 '' female iron pipe . however it is very easy to switch between male and femle connections so connection type should not be a deciding factor for you . 
it does stick more and is very hard to get food off of . i actually returned mine and got the one with the plastic . to fix the sticking you would have to by the paraflex sheets which defeats the purpose of having stainless steel . did mangoes and they stuck horribly . i like to dry strawberries and there is no way i would do them on the stainless steel . 
thank you for the question . whether you need the sheets depends on what you plan on making . anything that is sticky or juicy will require the sheets to prevent things from dripping onto lower layers . for example , if you 're making sweet potato chips and using olive oil , you 'll need the sheets . but if you 're making sweet potato chips and not using oil , the sheets are not necessary . fruit roll ups would require a sheet since they 're sticky and could make a mess on other trays . apricots , on the other hand , not so much . i hope this helps . please feel free to follow up with us at thehealthycornerstore if you want to find out about a specific food you 're thinking about . 
hello , thank you for clarifying the material this item is made of . the entire shell is made of abs plastic . the stainless steel you see are actually stainless steel panels that are inserted into the abs shell , that are more for appearance than function . the dehydrator does include stainless steel trays , and a clear polycarbonate door . if you are looking for a fully stainless steel dehydrator made by excalibur for home use , please see the new model the exc10el , which is quite expensive , however , it is because it is excalibur 's latest design with new doors , and a fully stainless shell case , digital timer , and armored glass doors . regards harvest essentials 
yes , that is correct . the healthy corner store is an authorized dealer . we also offer them on our website , so you can confirm . thanks for asking ! 
i recommend purchasing dehydrator sheets to prevent them from falling through . there are people on amazon who sell generic sheets that fit the excalibur for dirt cheap . best of luck ! regards , jamaica - the healthy corner store 
thanks for your question . yes , the excalibur stainless dehydrator with clear door does include a 10 year limited warranty from excalibur when purchased from an authorized retailer such as harvest essentials . 
as far as i can tell they are stainless - very nice unit 
according to the manufacturer 's web site , the stainless steel trays are `` constructed with 100 % 304 stainless steel , 1 4 inch square mesh . '' 304 stainless steel is 18 8 stainless steel ( = aisi usa 304 stainless steel or 1.4301 european standard bsen 10088 ) . when i spoke with the manufacturer directly , they said that both the stainless steel trays and the stainless steel outside panels use `` 5-4 '' stainless steel . i am not familiar with this stainless steel designation , and the manufacturer could not provide any more detail . given that the excalibur web site states that the trays are 304 stainless ( 18 8 ) , it 's likely that the outside panels are 18 8 stainless steel as well . 
so very sorry that i do not know if the unit is made of 18 10 stainless steel . please try to contact excalibur for that type of answer , as it is not mentioned in the description . i can tell you that it is easy to keep clean and i 've been extremely pleased with the purchase . 
the description says 600 watts . 
no problems with my packaging . all was there . 
yep . you should contact the company . they 'll probably mail you some . i 've had good luck getting parts for large items like this and it typically comes very fast . look for a piece of paper that says something along the lines of `` do not return to store if parts missing . '' it usually has the contact info you need . 
the headboard only is 22 '' . when we attached the wooden supports it was 52 '' off the floor . that number can change depending on what holes you use to attach the headboard . 
it is quite sturdy . not too soft . very firm . 
they are wood , possibly pine . 
no , it 's as wide as a queen bed so it would not attach to anything and the legs would show . 
yes , it 's made with fabric . and it looks very elegant . 
i 'm sorry but the headboard i assembled is not currently at my location . the 'kit ' did include bolts , washers , nuts , and an allen wrench for assembly though so i would email or call the manufacturer and have them send them to you . i 've ordered from lexmod before and was always happy with their products and service . 
yes . mine is attached to a standard adjustable metal bed frame . 
i just purchased the headboard and assembled the standard means . however it rocks back and forth driving me nuts . the product looks great and i will mount it to the wall but , you to be handy to do so . 
yes , it can . my daughter assembled it to her queen head frame without any issue . 
all you need to do is choose the height of your headboard depending on your mattress . the two legs of the headboard have holes for you to put the provided bolt , washer and nut into . it is super easy and takes only a minute . there are two bolts for each side . 
yes 
the product mod-5042-gry has an overall height of 53 '' . 
it 's a tad bit lighter , but i was happy with it . 
the product mod-5042-gry can fit any standard bed . 
each layer holds 12 cupcakes . so this model holds 24 cupcakes 
i believe you can . i have inspected mine and there are the hooks on the bottom of the second layer to attach another layer . i do not think you will have any problems doing that . i can not say if it would be too heavy . but i highly doubt it . hope this helps . 
yes , you can also remove the cupcake holder to carry something else like a pie , so its pretty versatile . 
do not purchase these ! all cupcakes fall over . inside height maybe 1 2 '' ... .maybe . these are a joke ! 
yes , for traditional cupcakes there is no problem using both layers . i have also used it for mini cupcakes and it hold lots . i love this carrier . 
it possibly could ? it comes with a flat tray for cakes too . 
no , it has not . 
yes 
yes 
yes 
i lined them with plastic wrap and filled them with water just to the bottom of the metal retaining band . here is what i got : large : 4 cups medium : 2 cups small : 1 4 cup 
thank you for your question . the diameter of the largest strainer is 7-7 8-inch . i hope to have informed you sufficiently . best wishes , all times finest 
dear happy reader , that is a good question . the lengths of the strainers given in the description excludes the lengths of the handle . the diameters are given in the description , however the lengths of the handles are 6 '' , 5.5 '' and 4.6 '' respectively from large to smallest . hope this answers your question . if not , just let us know and we will elaborate further . 
thank you for taking interest in our set of strainers . i am sorry to hear you had a miss purchase before , but have no fear all times finest is here ! : p.. haha but back on topic , these are very sturdy and during . when comparing our quality to the ones of cuisinart for example , the quality of both are actually quite the same . all our sets should come in perfect condition , and should n't be bent or have squished mesh . however , during transport somethings can always get messed up , so if this happens , just contact me straight away and i will sort it out for you in a flash !  they will work for almost any seeds or grains as long as they are not grinded crushed . quinoa , rice , and other grains which remain in the form how they occur in nature will work . but maybe this is n't the answer to your question . what do you mean exactly with will the strainers work for those grains ? will you be able to clean them in a proper way , than the answer is yes without a doubt . if , you mean something else , please let me know . 
i 'm sorry for the inconvenience , there was a minor glitch in the system . it 's resolved now . and off course a price of 500 usd is ridiculous , this would have implied that the strainers would have been made out of 24 k gold . the price is adjusted right now , and you can order at any time at the regular price . 
we had to test this out ourselves , but unfortunately this is not the case . the grain size of ground coffee can be compared to that of flour . there are hardly any strainers that are fine enough to strain coffee . most people use a coffee filter inside these strainers to make sure it does n't fall through . 
actually , this why i bought it , to rinse my quinoa . so just to confirm the mesh is fine enough that it will not fall through . 
these strainers are made in china and shipped to the usa . 
of the largest strainer the depth is 2.5 inches . 
yes you can . it is a much finer strain tho . 
i 'm on vacation so i ca n't measure it but it 's about the size of a carry on suitcase . very compact . hope this helps . i will measure it when i get home sunday and get back to you . 
i put standard queen on and they fit great . 
about 40 
15-30 seconds . just opening the plug on the end will deflate quickly but you can also turn the air pump on and set it to deflate and the motor will suck air out of the mattress . it deflates quickly enough by just opening the valve that i 've never used the pump except to see how it worked . 
hello megan- the bottom does not have a grip but the bed is pretty heavy so i do not think it will slide around , especially when people are sleeping on it . we used it camping and it was on a slippery tent floor and stayed put just fine . the memory foam is secured by a zipper that you can use to take it out . 
the cutting blades are made of 420j2 stainless steel , which is a highly corrosion resistant steel . this material is highly resistant to food acids , detergents , etc . the can opener is guaranteed not to rust , ever 
no , its made in china by a very reputable company that produces quality products . its a very nice can opener . 
in my experience all can openers last much longer if they are washed by hand but since this is all stainless steel construction you probably can use the dishwasher . 
really ? i was very surprised on how smooth this can opener works ! and my husband can be very hard on our kitchen tools and it has held up very well . 
i do n't know what a # 10 can is , but i 've opened every size can that i 've bought from the supermarket . i 've never had a problem opening any cans . this is the best hand can opener i 've ever had , and i 've had almost every one on the market . i think you 'd be happy with this opener , and i 'm sure it would open a # 10 can . 
i mainly wash it but hand but the few times i have put it in the washer it was fine . 
it can be used by both left handed people & right handed people . 
bought this for my hurricane survival kit and thankfully have n't had to use it yet , but in the name of science i 'll use it today and report back . 
yes ! this is a very well built and sturdy can opener , which will probably outlast me ; ) and it is almost effortless to use . for me it was well worth investing in . buy one you 'll be glad you did . 
there 's a fitting on the bottom of the torch that fits the butane . turn the torch upside down , fit the butane dispenser to the fitting , and push . very simple . 
the torch and fuel are separate items . it 's available at any kitchen store . 
no it does n't . you have to buy the butane canister separately . 
no , the fuel lasts a long time - but i use it periodically . it 's easy to refill . 
you put it well . total overkill , but it would light your candles . 
there is a push button on the back end of the torch . it also has a toggle switch to control the heat of the flame . 
yes 
no you do n't have to fill all the way , and it lasts quite a long time . mine has never leaked , it 's a good product . 
on the handle of the lid there is a button to push , that releases the top so you can flip it open . after you do that , turn the infuser counter clock-wise to loosen it . then grab the infuser 's handle and pull it through the top . reverse to place it back in . 
absolutely ! ! ! ! i 've done both frozen and fresh and they work great . i 've used this infuser now for over a month and we love it ! ! ! ! with the size of the infuser the fruit lasts for a good week . one little tip : be sure to shake it each time before you pour to get the maximum flavor . you 're gon na love it ! ! ! ! 
11 1 2 inches at the tallest point - with the lid on and closed ; fits in my fridge door 
not really sure about this . the infusing core screws into the lid . the infusing core however has slits in it . i 've filled it the pitcher with water by lifting up the lid and pouring the water directly into the infusing core . the lid itself screws on . to get liqid out , you have to partially unscrew the lid so i would assume that you could shake it . 
no , i think the holes are too large and you would get too many floaters . 
should work for sangria . standard pitcher in regard to use . 
it is heavy plastic so i suppose you could but infusion works best in cold water . 
you have to unscrew it at least a little to pour out if it . half a turn is enough to get liquid out . 
there 's a button on the side of the lid . you push the button in and the top of the lid pops open and then you can lift the diffuser out to fill . would have been much simpler if the instructions were on the outside rather than in the diffuser where they ca n't be accessed until you figure it out ! 
the core did not have anything to put inside other than whatever fruit you want to add . i sometimes freeze the fruit in the core and once it freezes put it in the pitcher . 
the legs are stained red mahogany and poorly sprayed with polyurethane . the same for the cushion box wood areas . it does not have the quality led to believe by the photo . i completely stripped and refinished mine and changed the legs to round bun feet . 
9-1 2inches tall 
it 's crap . in other word 's do n't waste your money . the first one they sent had a broken piece and the screw on leg 's were uneven . they sent a second one at no cost but it 's made in china and is cheaply made . get something made in the us . hope this help 's . 
size is 15.5 x11 inches . floral cover includes red , green , orange and beige tones . 
this item has a weight limit of 33lbs . 
dear valued customer : thank you for your email . please note item # 97003 , `` tapestry stool '' weighs 4.4 lbs . if you have any further questions , please feel free to contact us again . thank you for contacting collections etc . on amazon ! 
measures 15 1 2 '' l x 11 '' w x 12 '' h . 
yes , the grinder does stand on end . i bought three of these , one for myself and one for each of my children . one pepper grinder part broke within two months . the seller 's lifetime guarantee is useless , they do not respond ; but amazon is trustworthy . 
rinse with mild soap and warm water and let it air dry with end caps off . 
it 's about 8-9 inches talk and about and almost two inches in diameter . we 've had it for a while now and it 's a great product , well made , very user friendly and very easy to adjust from course to fine . hope this helps ! 
she should be ok , if she doesnt like it , just have her reach out to me and i will issue her a refund . 
yes 
absolutely ! ! as far as it goes that i can tell , this mechanical devise has been so nice for me that is , that you could use it for a number of different herbs or different salts , peppercorns , etc ... i have a variety in mine presently . and on the opposite end have a part himalayan salt part hawaiian black salt combo ! ! it is definitely your preference as long as you stick to the guidelines on not over tightening for the size of how fine you want it to grind . which i have had no problem with mind the way it came ... 
it 's not going to grind a *chunk . * i would suggest putting the chunk in a thick plastic bag , take it outside and hit it with a hammer until it is fairly well ground up . then put it in the mill . i grind coarse ground celtic sea salt in it with no problems whatsoever . it does a great job . 
the actual mechanism is made of ceramic , all around it is stainless steel . it 's a great product and very high quality . remember , we have a 100 % money back guarantee if your not happy so buy with confidence ! 
yes there is a dial on the bottom of each end that you can adjust to as fine or coarse as you want that is why me and my wife enjoy this grinder she likes it fine i like it coarse . 
it doesnt , many of our customer prefer different types of salt and pepper so we let them fill it with their preference on their own . 
with the easy clean lid the entire mechanism inside flips out of the lid so that you can clean in all the little parts and pieces . the open access lid only had a flap that opened so you could reach the mechanics inside . it was a very tight space and still hard to clean , this new one is much better and so much easier to clean ! 
the interior is a stainless metal . 
yes , it does . you just need to remove the drip tray , and it fits easily . 
yes . the bottom is stamped with `` made in china '' 
so far so good , i bought one for myself and also for my wife and we could not possibly be any happier with them . i work in the commercial cabling industry and am in warehouses around steel , hammers hammers every tool imaginable , and even though it 's a little scratched on on the bottom , it has maintained it 's seal , no leaks ever . it is definitely designed and built well for the avid coffee drinker such as myself . it is top quality and very rugged . my my wife and are hooked and have thrown out our other travel mugs . i hope this answered your question . 
as long as you lock the top switch , it 's completely leakproof . i fill this with coffee every morning and throw it in my purse - many times it 's upside down . never leaks even a drop . 
no you can not , the cup is stainless steal . metal and microwave are a bad combination 
16 oz fills it and allows it to close the cup without spilling over when you screw the lid on . 
no grips but i do not feel slippery when i hold it ( bare handed ) 
yes 
16 ounces if you fill it full . 14 ounces of coffee puts it about an inch from the brim . 
the mug itself is all stainless steel . just the lid is plastic 
i have a lot of contigo travel mugs and i really do n't think you 'd be able to use a west loop for anything more than coffee , tea or water or a soft drink ( do n't tell contigo but i use the west loop for soft drinks all the time . most of the time i do n't use the lid but there are times when i need to leave and there 's just too much to throw away , so , top on and out the door i go . no problems with that so far ! ) i would suggest one of the water bottles that have the built in straw or the shake and go tumbler that has the amazing top that again does n't spill or leak . they come with a hard plastic straw . there is a new water bottle now that is glass and has a wider opening with a screw-on lid . it 's called the purity water bottle and it 's really nice . go to the contigo web site gocontigo.com and have a look around . i think you 'll find something there that will meet your needs . plus , no offense to amazon but the shipping is must faster when you order directly from the company . hope this helps ! you know ... i should probably work for this company ! i 've answered many questions for their products . : )

no strainer . tea leaves sometimes come thru . but it 's otherwise perfect 
i measured 6 and 3 4 inches without the lid . 7 3 4 with lid . but i suggest keeping the lid off while adding coffee , otherwise it 's just plain messy . 
i 've got a normal size cup holder in my kia optima , yes it fits fine . 
no not at all . has a good safety button to lock it shut when transporting it . 
no i can , you have to purchase them separately 
i can not but you can place them together on your purchase , thanks 
i am reading this directly from the package insert i received with my mug . the lid and any unpainted stainless steel body parts are top-rack dishwasher safe . any painted stainless steel bodies are to be hand washed only . i have a blue mug so it must be hand washed . only the type with no color other than the natural color of stainless steel may be placed in the dishwasher . 
11.5 ounces describes the weight of the product ( the empty mug ) . the capacity of the mug is 16 ounces . the entire mug filled to capacity is the sum of 26.5 oz before your first sip . so , it could feel a bit heavy until you have consumed enough of the contents . i was considering a 24 oz and then realized i would be carrying a mug that is heavier than a 1 liter soda bottler , over 2 pounds . hope that was helpful . 
6 and 3 4 '' 
the 20oz will not fit upright under the k75 platinum brewer , even with the bottom drip pan tray removed . the 16oz fits fine though . 
yes . although the plain stainless steel mug , like the colored mugs , says `` hand wash body '' on the bottom , the instruction sheet that comes with the mug says `` lid and any unpainted stainless steel body are top-rack dishwasher safe . '' 
no . it 's metal ! 
the lid is bpa-free plastic . it says so on the contigo website and in the amazon description . 
so far i have n't had any problem with that . 
mark as defective and exchange or return it . mine did not leak at all . it just could n't keep anything hot . 
yes , the mug is completely stainless steel . the mug is not dishwasher safe but a very good mug otherwise . 
this is a smooth and potentially slippery container with no ridges to help maintain a grip . it is also quite large , so large that a big guy like me ca n't get his hand completely around it . depending on your particular difficulty , it probably wo n't be something that is easy to use with only one hand . even i have to reposition it when i pick it up , and turning it to the proper position to drink takes some manipulation . however , it would probably work well with two hands , one hand to grip and one to operate . i can use it in the car with one hand if i pick it up the correct way . hope this helps . 
i know exactly what you are talking about with the lids on other styles of coffee containers . just run it through the dishwasher and it 's good to go . 
yes , it fits well without any problems . 
you can try to see you can get a replacement from amazon because sometime the lid cost more to just replace the lid 
it 's made in china 
8 '' with the cap on 
16 oz 
if you read the product description , it states two sizes : 16 oz and 20 oz . 
china 
the new cap does fit on the old style mug . i do not know where you would be able to find the new cap separately . 
it 's not durable . i had n't even owned mine for a year and now the armrests are crumbling and the seat back wo n't stay locked , it always rocks now . as far as weight capacity , i 'm 220ish , so if it ca n't handle me for more than a year , i definitely would n't recommend this . 
i still have the box it was shipped in , which measures exactly 11.5 in . in width , 24 in . in height , and 28 inches in length . i am a 5 ft , 6 in . female and i had a difficult time carrying it by myself up a flight of stairs . 
they do have parts , they sent me the back slider tube , however , not the right part i needed to fix the problem . if i remember right , warranty is only 90 days unless that has changed . 
at the current height ( seat back ) i have it , its 20 '' from the seat to the back top . there is about another 3 '' left ( to move it up ) on the slide adjustment . the back lumbar is best for me at the current height . 
if the back does not fit in the slot , the chair might have been damaged in shipment . i had the same issue and tried to get the part replaced . no luck dealing with manufacturer . ( although the documents state to not contact seller and to contact manhattan comfort directly . you might find going through amazon is quicker and less troublesome . ) 
rock ... well its not a rocking chair . its built well over all , no backward motion in it if that is the question . as for extended use - i added another seat cushion , though for most that probably would n't be necessary . the extra cushion also adds a bit more height to the chair as i like to keep my workstation kb and mouse platform a bit higher than the work table . ive sat in it for hours a a time with no adverse issues ... as i said in my rating description ... love the chair ! if you get one that does n't have the seat back locking problem - i think most anyone would be very pleased ~~ 
the arm heights are adjustable but not low enuf for me ( 5ft3in ) ... it does n't bother my wife who 's the same height so go figure ... 
no , do n't buy . it broke after 6 months 
yes , it has springs . i have not experienced creaking with the springs in this bed . however , you may need a pad , because the springs will poke your ribs if you are thin and lay right on them . i folded up a quilt beneath my separate mattress cover and it helped . note that i purchased the queen size . 
me personally , i 'd get a topper . 
what does that even mean . 
ys 
80 '' 
this mattress was manufactured in china . 
yes it can . but one side does not have as much cushion as the other . 
no , i am 6 ft and weigh around 180lb . 
it is pretty portable when it is brand new and un-opened . but once the vacuum sealed bag is opened , it becomes a normal spring mattress . 
it 's a standard us queen , i purchased a queen frame and it fit perfectly 
this set is 3.0 2.5 with 100 gram knife . it is a medium weight 18 10 set . usually i would say a light weight set would be 2.2 2.0 and below and these sets are usually made of 18 0 . 18 10 sets usually are either 3.5 3.0 or 3.0 2.5. thomas 
these are 18 10 goods 
yes the knives have a serration . 
the dinner fork is 8 '' long 
sturdy and not too heavy . i mainly use the salad fork for my meals because its easier to hold , in my opinion . the set is very nice though . 
thermopop can be used to temp items in the oven , however it can not be left in the oven . it will melt ! 
no 
i 'm not sure what the temperature of farmer 's cheese should be ( so is it in the range of what the thermo pop can measure ) ; but if the question is can it determine liquid temperatures , the answer is yes and very quickly . 
no , but it sure works well . not many are waterproof 
yes , it will work for a turkey . this tool is one of the best that you can buy and i highly recommend it . 
yes you can , just wait a few seconds for the most accurate reading ... .i have used it for the liquid portion of bread already and it is very accurate . just be sure when checking temperature , that the tip does not touch the pot or the container . because that will give you an inaccurate reading . 
the probe is 4.5 '' long . it is 1 8 '' ( 3 cm ) thick , except for the last 1 2 '' ( at the tip ) where it narrows to 2 cm ( a little over 1 16 '' ) . 
average , about 2 to 3seconds . 
i do n't think so . it 's meant to be inserted into chicken or meat to check the internal temperature . there are special thermometers for frying temperature . 
yes . 
there are six different height adjustments .

i 'd say the top is plastic and it weighs maybe 8 ounces . the top can fold down but that 's it . 
no . the table 's top is not adjustable in that way . there is a slight tilt to it , but one can not adjust it . you can adjust height of the table . 
it does slant forward indeed . there is n't adjustments , but i 'm sure you can find a way to somewhat force it . it 's now a big problem for me . 
placed in the lowest position , the table is 21 '' high in the back and 22 '' high in the front . the front of my table is an inch higher than at the back , perhaps to compensate for something heaving being placed at the front ? at its highest setting , the table is approximately 28 and 1 2 '' high in the back and approximately 29 and 1 2 '' high in the front . there are four other height settings between the highest and lowest settings and each are 2 '' apart . maggie 
yes it can be removed , very handi 
it wo n't adjust at all . it barely assembles . total piece of garbage . do not purchase ! 
little over an inch . 
yes , it has 6 adjustment levels about 1.5 inch apart . 
i did n't receive a cleaning tool , but i did n't see it listed in the description . i use a vegetable brush to clean mine . the ebook link came in an e-mail from iperfekt kitchen acknowledging and thanking me for the purchase . you may have overlooked it ; i almost did . i would try e-mailing them and asking them to send the link . 
its not the same but they all kinda look alike . not sure if they all work the same but this one just didnt work up to what we had expected

yes the tube of left over vegetable is normal . a good use for this may be for composting , or give to the dog . i put mine in garbage disposal . 
yes , with no problem 
hey lisa , after my a few tried with beets , it works for us . we have some experience you might like to know regard to how to use our envy slicer for best results : - regarding getting a better experience with carrots , zucchini , beets ... i remember that the first time we used carrots ourselves , the strips did n't come out from the blade as long strips . because carrots are hard , often their strips wo n't be as long as with soft vegetables such as summer squash , zucchini , eggplant , beets , etc . i practiced with zucchini ( as you can see on the package ) and were quickly able to get nice , long strips with our carrots . be sure to use fresh carrots , zucchini that are thick enough to fully utilize your slicer blades . - strongly recommend using fresh and thick veggies enough for best results . if it does n't work , it might be due to very rarely item which defective during shipping processing . although this product is very easy to use which is designed for `` no-brainer '' to use , it might need a little practice depend on various people 's desire . hope this help ! -jessica 
i ca n't speak for everyone , but for me , no , not at all . there are two indentations to cradle the neck and my shoulder tucks into the curve so that my neck feels very supported . i do n't feel like i am at the edge or that my head will slip off at all . it is really nice have the two places to rest my head because i am one of those people who shifts the pillow when it is warm to find a cool spot . you can face either way in the indentation and when i am facing out ( away from the center of the pillow ) there is a generous hand width from my face to the edge of the pillow . the pillow has square edges and is firm , so it is not like a regular pillow that slopes away on the ends -- you get the same support the entire width of the pillow . 
the medium seems pretty small to me and it 's very squishy . i would try a lg maybe unless you want a pretty soft one . 
the cover unzips and can be washed in the washing machine . 
i purchased an xl . it did n't work for me at all . i tried it for 2 nights and then had my husband try it . it did n't work . i just went to my amazon account and went to the section for returning something . i printed up a return label , including postage , and sent it back to amazon . they reimbursed the purchase price . i did buy another one of these pillows , just in a smaller size . it has worked fantastic . my problem is shoulder pain and this pillow allows me to sleep on my side without having any pain . it has really been a miracle pillow for me . but if it does n't work for you , you can return it and get a full refund . best of luck ! 
the cover is attached . i just use a pillow case over it . i do n't think there are replacement covers . 
the dimensions are 24.2in x 13.4in x 4.53in which the 4.53in is the thickness height where you lay your head in between . i hope this information helps . 
i think that this pillow is okay for someone who sleeps on their back . i have only use it for one week . however , i do like the firmness of the large pillow that i bought . i think the quality is much better then the average pillow . i thinks it okay for side position sleeping as well . i do like this pillow as my main pillow head rest . 
regular pillow cases will fit . 
i sometimes sleep on my back . the contour is slight and feels comfortable . not sure how much of a contour you want but both ways feel great to me ! i have spent so much money on doctors , pillows and aids but this is the best investment i have made . 
the thickness is listed as 15.5 cm . ( 6.1 inches ) . the length is approximately 24 inches and the length from front to back measures approximately 11.5 inches except where the neck fits in the center of the pillow is approximately 12.5 inches . hope this helps . 
medium is 24x13x4 ( on the thick side ) or 2 on the other side . large is 24x13x5 ( on the thick side ) i love this pillow ! no odor . cool and comfy . perfect . no fluffing necessary ever ! soooo much better than a regular pillow . my daughter got one of those $ 150 tempurpedic pillows which she loves but she has no problems sleeping or has an neck pain - and she can sleep in any position . i ca n't sleep on it . this thing is great ! i primarily sleep on my side but this thing is even great if you sleep on your belly . enjoy 
i am not sure if it might vary with different size pillows . mine is a medium and it is 4 inches on the high end and 2 inches on the lower end . 
i bought a medium and it is plenty big for me ; in fact , i would not want it any larger . i am no tiny woman either . i normally wear a size large , being 5'4 '' and about 160. when i wear a t-shirt , i buy a men 's xl simply for the comfort factor . i hope this helps you . 
memory foam is memory foam which is polyurethane and added chemicals increasing it 's viscosity . 
the pillow is made in china . and to be very blunt , do n't buy it . it is not memory foam . 
i do n't know , i bought the medium size pillow . 
i weigh 110 - i purchased the medium - it 's fine - just too hard for me . 
i ca n't remember but i 'm pretty sure it was per piece . they are also a little smaller than they look . 
i received 3 per each `` set '' i ordered . 
i used a chalk marker and it did n't come off so i had to repaint it . but regular chalk comes off fine 
yes , i just used a magic eraser to clean them . it works perfect ! 
the writable chaulkboard area is 3 '' x 2 '' . the overall is 3 '' high x 3 '' wide . very cute when used for a party buffet 
i want to know that as well , too bad you did n't get an answer 
yes it does 
no it does not link to fitbit

no it does not track your previous weighings . 
no it doesnt . it can store upto 5 profiles internally tho . 
each time you stand on it . it recognizes the person by the weight . unless you have a significant weight loss in a short space of time , it will remember you . you also need to stand on it ( a few seconds ) until it calculates the various functions . 
tenths as well . i am very pleased with this scale . when i first got it , it would only measure weight but i pushed the reset and it started showing everything . very easy : ) 
you have to stay on the scale until the gauge thing at the top goes all the way to the right and then it will start displaying all the additional information . if you step on , the weight is displayed and then step off , the scale does n't have time to calculate the information . you also need to stand still . 
the numbers that come up are so small i ca n't read them . it 's the numbers that i am interested in , so it 's abit of disappointment but oh well it weighs right so that 's o.k . they also click off so fast to that it would be hard to write them down to compare . 
yes 
we use this pump on a coleman air mattress . works quite well . 
yes . use the vacuum end of the orifice to deflate a mattress . 
yes it works with 220 , i 've used it in the us and just plugged it in . 
mine came with a hose , you should contact the seller 
maybe large one , it way too powerfull for the average size . 
no , only the attachments you see in the picture . 
i has 3 nozzles out of which one is as small as h3 , but not sure whether its exactly h3 or not . 
yes it does .i purchased it for an intex queen size mattress 
no 
regular old usa 3 prong plug . i 've used mine several times , remember not to go over the fill line inside the pot . 
the capacity easily makes three cups of tea with some water to spare . i chose the smaller pot on purpose because my sister has a taller pot and it is very heavy to pick up when filled . i love the this pot , just the right size . 
yes , i think so . mine 's been perfect . check to see if you filled it over the max line - it will spurt and sputter in that case . 
no - this kettle is amazing . i really do n't know how i lived without one for so long . and their customer service is tiptop . 
1.2 kg or about 2.65 lbs 
no 
the blue light turns off and shuts the pot off as well . the water boils very quickly . there is a small click sound as the light turns off so you have to keep and eye on the water . 
about 5 minutes 
i do n't know whether it is exactly lead-free . you would need a lab test for this answer if you do n't trust the seller . 
yes , you can i did for my closet 's door too , it woorks ! 
children 's shoes sizes 3 or 4 or larger would work 
instructions say brackets can be cut and screwed onto door - otherwise maximum width is 1.4 inches .

the hulls are buckwheat..i do n't know if they are organic ... .they come in a separate bag from the foam . you do not need to use the foam . the first pillow i had was buckwheat only and i was happy with that . the second pillow came with foam also for those people that wanted a little softness . you could mix as much foam as you wanted to make the pillow softer . 
if you use a pillow case ( recommended ) you should n't need to wash the pillow cover often . when you do , it 's easy to just dump out the filling into a 5-gallon bucket , wash and dry it according to the label instructions , and then replace the hulls using a measuring cup or bowl . 
i do n't have the experience myself with cpap stomach sleeper , but i know 2 different people that do and they love this pillow . i hope that helps you . this pillow forms around you no matter how you lay . 
i believe they are the same pillows . the picture of the brochure in the cpapfit cpap pillow shows `` by pur-sleep , '' and the order receipt included with my pillow showed the same manufacturer , `` pur-sleep . '' in addition , both pillows appear identical in the pictures with the same 10 year warranty and patents pending . i could not find any conflicting information , though some information could not be matched ( such as upc or dimensions ) due to omission of that information from one of the pillows . while the price is the same for either pillow , i had a positive experience with the vendor `` form-fit pillow , '' plus the one listed here has almost three times the amount of reviews . hope this helps ! 
i 'd try the seller . 
it fits in an ordinary pillow case . the shape is `` moldable '' so you can push the hulls around to make it a more normal pillow shape when making the bed , for example . 
yes , the pillow now ships with foam , pre-blended with the hulls . 
yes it does ! : ) 
19x14x4 
yes it does 
they have changed them from when i bought them in may 2013. mine came with a plastic cap ( yuk ) like others listed , and these would have been better with the stainless steel cap . not sure if they are the same bottle , even though they are listed as the same bottle . mine are : 7 3 4 '' height x 2 3 4 '' diameter 
it is clear , smooth glass and it is sturdy -- not a thin delicate glass . 
they are too big . the water bottles are fantastic though . 
i believe they would . there is a washer in the cap and the bottle has 2 grooves of threading so it screws down pretty well . 
i was n't sure so ran a test for you last night . made some tea and put it in the fridge . did n't use stove top boiled water , but microwave boiled water . no cracking . you might want to make a bottle holder of some sort since the bottle was very hot . you should still check with manufacturer about cracking danger though . i have used a similar thickness bottle , that let 's you unscrew the bottom to fill with ice , then add your tea and hot water to make instantaneous ice tea . hope this helps . 
aquasana 's caps fit the same as these ( i got their silicone sleeves which comes with the colored caps , but you can just get the caps from their website directly calling them ) 
they are smooth . love them & use them every day for juicing . 
yes they are . they 're great ! 
yes 
120v models are 20 dollars more than 230v models . 12k , model is 20 dollar more than 9k for the same voltage . so the $ 20 difference balances out ( -20 +20 ) , when you compare the 9k 110v with 12k 230v model . no plugs on any of our units . they are all directly wired to their terminal blocks . 
yes . in cooling mode fan runs in fan only mode , when the compressor shuts off . 
the inverter driver is the compressor only for this version . but do take note that seer is not a systems overall efficiency , look at the eer rating as well , they have full inverter systems rated at 21 seer , where the active filter module , power module and rectification and reactor system drives all the motors in the system allowing them to achieve much higher efficiency , which is the same as the full inverter fujitsu units and full inverter mr. slim . mitsubishi and fujitsu also offer mid-range inverter equipment to 14-16seer just as pioneer has with this system . all equipment specs and engineering information is available at the manufacturers website . highseer.com . and one more thing , i have 6 of these unit in my home now , and they are fantastic , not to mention everyone who sees them gets jealous and wants one lol . 
i have the 9k btu model , the indoor unit is approx . 26.5 '' wide , 10 '' high and protrudes 7.5 '' from the wall . my connections will exit the wall behind the unit so they will not be visible . 
the remote looks different . i bought my unit 2 years ago . if you live in colder weather you probably want a unit that has a defroster . these units without a defroster freeze up at around 34 degrees when you run the heater heat pump . 
this unit requires 208-230v ac power . i suppose it could be mounted to a semi truck , but you would have carry around one hell of a generator to power it ! 
i have 2 rooms like that and bought 9000 btu for each and work good . the rooms cool and heat fast . 
yes , there is a small condenser unit that is located outside 
https : highseer.com pdf wye-2014.pdf 
they come with hanging brackets for the indoor units . as long as you mount the outdoor units on a slab or any other solid flat surface , you do not need any other brackets . 
it 's 14 '' long by about 3 '' at beater end 
it is metal stainless steel . i only use mine in cups , bowls , and pans ... ... i have n't had a need to use it in a teflon skillet . i do all my mixing in measuring cup or bowl and pour it into my skillet . my pans are not coated , so nothing to scratch when used in my pans . hope this helped . 
i do n't know , but it is well made . nice quality and performs well . 
no , i have not noticed this at all . i use it regularly , but mostly with cold items so far . thanks . 
14 '' long and 2 1 2 '' diameter 
standard miracle whisk plus 
it 's friendly , works really and very handy . you do n't have to take a bunch of stuff out for a single task ( i.e . : electric mixer , attach the beaters etc . ) 
yes it will work for that , but may take a few minutes . just not instant . 
16 '' -18 '' long with a whip about 6 inch diameter 2.5-3. `` across perfectly fits in any standard coffee cup a great product , use it daily and my wife loves it ! 
no . there are no chopping blades . no on fruit . it is for liquids . 
do not spend your money on this product . i purchased it directly from the manufacture and regret it . does not work . could not get a representative to speak with me to return the product . scotts liquid gold is still the best . 
i was n't pleased at all with the product ... ... ... . i would n't use it on my marble ... ... .. i think it was supposed to be used on wood 
the bottles are 12 ounces each . 
because some people will believe anything and if some scam artist can make a quick buck , they will keep it on here . 
i tried it on water rings and it did n't work , tried it on an antique desk and it did not produce the results they show on tv . that 's just my personal experience . 
slimy goo 
yes , and it is more sticky then slippery , and it did nothing but dull the wood floor . 
yes , just discussed this with the company 's staff over the phone . 
the probe can withstand temperatures of up to 572 degrees f. if you need , idevices sells a pro meat probe that can withstand temperatures up to 700 degrees f. http : idevicesinc.com 
it does now ... http : www.androidcentral.com igrill-devices-now-work-android ? utm_source=ac & utm_medium=dlvrit 
yes graphs the temp rise . gives you a 10 degree alert to ready . great product 
yes you can . probes are available on idevices website . http : idevicesinc.com 
i believe it would for sure , as i have tried it with my iphone 5c and it was working great , so i assume that it would be the same , if not better with iphone 6. hope that helps ... 
yes , i have used it for brewing and it works really well . it 's good especially for the mash tun . you can set a custom set point so it alarms if you want . the graph feature is nice too as it shows how fast the temp is changing . there is a built in timer also if you need . if you have two probes , you can monitor your liquor tun too . 
not sure about the minimum , but meat right out of the refrigerator registers in the low 40 's . i have n't stuck it in the freezer yet , but maybe i 'll give it a try just to test and get back for another review ! this device is not a piece of crap as yankee man seems to think . for smoking and cooking on my traeger , the registered temps are very accurate , and being able to track everything on your idevice is awesome . setting custom cook temps is great ! i use the app on both the ipad and iphone . 
i do n't think it 's `` instant '' , but within a minute i would guess . i have not tried it . 
as long as there is a way to get the cord out and the temperature stays at 572 f or below , i do n't see why not . note that it does n't have a display or alarm on the transmitter , so you have to keep your phone or tablet in range if you want to know the temperature . 
not only made in china , but also design created in china , as i read the user manual written in english . 
yes . it worked fine with timer . you can preset the cooking end time that means program will start much earlier than end ( ready ) time . 
sure ! any size , love all its functions.. use it every day . for my lifestyle . hope this helps . 
dear valued customer , thank you for contacting rosewill support service . you should be able to cook lentils and legumes with the rice cooker . however , you will need to search for recipe online as rhrc-13001 is mainly for rice cooking , porridge , stewing small pot rice , reheating , soup , steaming , and soaked rice , according to different rice species . thank you for choosing rosewill . sincerely , mick rosewill support service agent call center hours : 1-800-575-9885 8am - 5pm ( pst ) monday - friday 
yes , both are included + a plastic steaming container . 
i 'm not sure exactly what the material is composed of , but it 's a regular teflon-type non-stick coating . i would contact rosewill directly for specifics . 
i 've only had mine for 6 months but it still works great and cleans up easily . 
should be using the pot it comes with . 
the lid has 3 pieces that are removable without tools . it is very easy to clean . 
i 've found that it works well but i 've only used it three times , i 've seen the same one in chinese buffets so either they r being cheap or they work good enough . 
i 'm not sure how to answer that except that it uses heat ( there is a heat element located at the top ) and a fan ( air ) - which circulates the heat . 
i have found that anything that you buy in a frozen state ( french fries , battered fish , etc . ) tastes amazing when cooked in the air fryer . if you make things fresh , add a little oil to the bottom and you 'll never know you did n't cook it in oil . i love mine . i use it all the time - not like those other appliances that you get talked into that sit in the garage ! ! 
i bought this for my daughter in law , so o doubt it . sorry i ca n't help . 
the manual says : settings & gt ; max temp 395.f max time 25 min & gt ; plin 
very easy . i always rinse the basket with hot water immediately after cooking . no need for detergent . never have to clean the interior . 
absolutely ! for uncooked food , i sometimes spray a light coat of olive oil . the food comes out golden brown .

regular household 110 ? 
excellent product 
according to the rubbermaid website , they are definitely bpa free . here is the link : http : www.rubbermaid.com pages learnaboutbpa.aspx hope this helps : - ) 
of course . i have had no issues putting them in the dishwasher . 
ten inches 
i bought these a couple months ago . they do n't screw on , but i 've shaken them lightly and have n't had any leaks . they are pretty secure for not having screw tops . i would be nervous about shaking them vigorously though . 
yes i think they are great pitchers ! 
there 's a slight click when you turn them to the open or closed setting . it seems like it 's gotten just slightly harder to open them as i use them more . but that could just be the result of holding with one hand and trying to open with the other ( non-dominant ) hand , without putting the pitcher down first . instead of turning , you can also fairly easily lift the lid out , move it to the open position and then put the lid back in . that 's usually what i do now . 
i do n't believe so . i have never had the kids fall off while pouring . i love these pitchers . 
the inner part that slides into the pitcher is 6.0625 '' the top or outer part is about 6.25 '' 
no 
they do not have screw on tops . leaking when shaking would be likely . 
this one has a flat bottom . the ones in our store without a frame are raised about .65 inches . 
it 's not reversible it has rubber feet on the bottom . it 's one inch thick and weights about 12lbs . 
i have 100 in stock . if you order today the three mats will leave our ohio warehouse tomorrow and they will arrive to you in three business days or less . 
no 
ok . we can removed it 
hi , item includes the strainer.you can concact to the sellers . 
10 small tea cups 50ml . gaiwan about 150ml , tea pitcher about 200 ml

my husband uses the juicer and says it 's a breeze to clean . all the veggie peels rinse right off . 
it 's better then other juicers not a 100 % but it gives you juice ... ... the kale well it 's okay but could be better ... . 
a voltage converter would adjust for that , however the frequency ( hz ) that the power grid runs from could be the issue . for example the us electric supply runs at 60hz , but the uk runs at 50hz . while this is n't a problem for small or static devices , it will likely pose a problem for kinetic appliances , such as the juicer in this case . what will happen is that the motor can not run at full power , as it tries to draw energy at a faster rate than can be provided by the grid , and this eventually kills the motor off . you could look into a voltage and frequency adaptor , but these are bulky and expensive . my suggestion would be to buy local to ensure a longer product life . ( sorry for all the babble , i hope it came across clear enough ! ) 
yes it does 
yes it did . the book was great , but unfortunately , the booster blender broke after about 10 uses . : 
it is my first juicer . i really like it . it works well , and cleans up quickly . i use it everyday . friends who have other juicers envy mine . 
if you 're within the 1 year replacement warranty , they 'll replace it with a new one . no charge at all ! they have excellent customer service ! i 'm not a blogger , nor did i receive this for free ( wish i did , though ) . this fan was actually sent to me as a replacement upgrade from my old ozeri that died on me . again , at no charge . i sent them my old one in the new box packaging , slapped their prepaid shipping label , and dropped it off at ups . 
i emailed cs and here is their response `` the target room temperature mode is a function which indicates to the fan the temperature which it should automatically turn on or off . this mode should be activated when the thermostat on the fan shows a temperature which you would like the fan to remain at . for example , if the temperature in the room ( and on the fan thermostat ) is 70 degrees and the target room temperature mode is activated at that time , the fan will then turn off if the temperature drops below 70 degrees or remain active if the temperature raises above 70 degrees . '' so basically press the auto button when the fan has cooled down the room to the desired temp , the fan will then automatically adjust to keep the room at that temp as long as the auto button is still on . 
push the little tab inwards and pull out 
no 
i have n't had to do it yet , but i am going to use my vacuum cleaner brush tool and vacuum the front and back with it . 
actually , if the item is found to be defective , the manufacturer will pay for the shipping on your item both to you and back to them . the customer is not required to pay for any shipping charges . 
onli if it is on 
you can set it so it does not oscillate 
it tells you in the product details : product dimensions : 6 x 6 x 38 inches ; 9 pounds 
no not at all . the fan sits on a larger base that is approximately 12 to 15 inches round . i hope that helps . 
i use this fan every day . it is 14 '' high , 12 3 4 '' wide , and 10 '' deep . i am very satisfied with the fan . iam 80 yrs old and live in the south east us . sit most of the day in my chair . keep a c on 80 degrees , with the fan on low about 8 ft away . quiet and comfortable 
yes , it does . i 've moved mine all over my room . and it 's been on several surfaces where it had to angle down to reach the spot i wanted . 
the wattage is 55w . the airflow at the quiet setting 9fps ; low setting is 15 fps ; medium setting is 18 fps ; and high setting is 21 fps . hope this helps ! 
the fan tilts both up and down ... do not tilt fan manually , use the oscillating feature to get to the desired position , then turn the oscillating feature off . 
it 's quieter than many other fans i found , but it 's not dead silent . you can still hear the fan blowing . 
as listed in the 2013 instruction manual & warranty `` warning : do not hang or mount this fan on ceiling . do not operate this fan in oscillation mode when it is wall mounted . '' 
ozf2 only has automatic horizontal oscillation . the ozf4 has auto dual-oscillation . 
yes , there is a screw in the front where the front panel should come off for cleaning . 
i just tried it , and yes , you must press a button remote in order to get the fan to turn on . i tuned the fan on , then unplugged it from the wall outlet , and reconnected it to the wall outlet and the fan did not turn on . 
flag it as a gift when you order and amazon will place it inside an unmarked box to avoid revealing the contents . 
it is fantastic on all uncooked vegetables . it is the first knife i reach for both meat as well as veges but not frozen stuff . 
you should never dishwash a knife , even a crummy one , even a steel one . the high pressure jets of water rattle blades around . even with steel , it dulls the blade and makes microscopic chips . this ruins a steel knife , ( whether the average user notices it or not ) a ceramic blade is harder and even more brittle than a steel blade . do not dishwash knives . becase ceramic is even more non porus and nonreactive than steel is , all you have to do is run it under soap and water and dry it . 
the manufacturer advises not to twist or torque the blade . also warns about not using it to smash a clove of garlic on a cutting board . since this is ceramic , it requires a bit more caution , but it does slice and chop terrifically . 
no . the blade is solid cermamic . 
i do n't believe they are full-tang . that said , because the ceramic knives are inherently more delicate than steel -- which means , for instance , they ca n't be used for tasks like smashing garlic -- i doubt that the kind of strength conferred by full-tang construction would add to the utility of these extremely sharp , but brittle , blades . also , the blades are lighter than steel and do n't need as much mass in the handle to be well-balanced . so , i do n't consider the apparent lack of a full tang to be a strike against the knife . 
no and that is one down point of this product . i wished to have a sheath for this knife . 
i have done extensive research on this and have found no country of origin for the manufacture of this knife . the company is based in oakland california and only markets two products ; this knife and a scale . that being said , the quality of the knife is good , it is lightweight and very sharp . it is my go to knife for slicing and dicing veggies and mushrooms . i have had it for about 6 months and with the proper care it has held up just fine . 
no sheath provided , when you buy the knife it will give you directions on how to store i put my in wood knife block . 
the angle is integral to edge durability . a shallow slope makes for increased sharpness , but at a steep cost ... reduced edge life expectancy . 
the total length of the knife is twelve ( 12 ) inches and the blade length is eight ( 8 ) inches . 
well , my whole motivation for juicing it 's because of the fat , sick and nearly dead documentary . after i took the joe cross 's challenge of the 10 days fast , i started looking for a good juicer that was going to help me through those 10 days of fast . i obviously was eager to buy the breville juicer , because one joe used in his documentary and two looked good . i was willing to pay whatever the price was for a good juicer . but then i noticed that , hey i was probably going to spend $ 500 or more in a machine , so i decided to do some research to se if probably for $ 500 bucks there was a better juicer . what i found is amazing . although the breville looks good and seems strong , many juice experts affirm that due to the high speed blade , tend to oxidize the mineral and vitamins of the fruits and veggies , for me that was a minus . besides that the breville is not good with leafy greens and due the high speed of the blade the juice yield it not as high as other juicer , without mentioning the loud nice they make . all of the cons are found on any high speed blade juicer on the marker . the only good thing is that they are fast , but with a lot of flaws on the other side . so my choice now is on slow juicers . after a deep research on youtube and on different websites i got my favorites the kuvings whole slow juicer b6000s and the omega vertical slow juicer . both around the same price but actually the omega with better stats in juice yield and pulp filtration , but at the end i decided to buy the kuvings just for one reason the wide feed chute . with a wide feed chute , no need to be cutting apples , carrots or other fruits or veggies into small pieces , that will help me save a lot of time . besides that the kuvings offers you more things to do than just jucing , you can also do smoothies or grin food ! ... .so that the reason why i choose the kuvings . kuvings has demostrated to be as good as all reviews says and can handle hours of juicing . 
it 's got a larger feed chute , different auger , better recipe book , more accessories , etc 
there are about 5 or 6 parts to clean . everything is easy but the pulp basket and pulp chute . the basket has a special 'basket tool ' to make it pretty easy to clean . you 'll need a long dental tool or similar thing to pull out the pulp that remains in its little chute . all in all , it 's not too bad . i just rinse everything well right after juicing . and i do n't use soap often at all . let it all drip dry . 
this juicer is the us model in 110 volt 60 hertz . it can not and should not be used on 220 volt 240v 50 hz with any sort of converter transformer as it will void any warranty , and will cause premature wear on the motor . an international model of this juicer is not available for sale from a us source at this time . 
not oftin but if the top was 5-6 in it would be better 
i have an omega and a kuving . the thing with the kuving is that you are paying for the wide mouth and end up having to chop everything up anyway - or the veggies get stuck and the whole thing stops . so why bother paying for an expensive juicer when the omega works great and both require chopping things up first ? 
yes this juicer juices beets well and greens etc. , if your peaches and apples are soft they will be mushy , they recommend you use hard fruit , no jams it chews it very smoothly , also i juice wheatgrass , as well , also make sorbet , they have a great demonstration on youtube.com.best juicer , i highly recommend it . good luck . 
yes . 
this model is a us 110 volt model for use in n america . it is not designed for or intended to be used on 220 volt or other voltages , even with a transformer inverter , as the voltage irregularity seen through these types of devices may impact the performance and longevity of the motor . 
hi katie , i have heard so many different answers to this question . i do n't think it matters what kind of juicer you use , they all are going to give you fresh , raw juice that has all the nutrients for you to consume right then and there . those nutrients you get will break down the longer you let the juice sit . i 've heard twelve hours , fifteen hours , etc , 72 seems like a lot . what i 've heard the most from people that have juiced for a long time is that it 's best to drink it right away so you can get all of those nutrients before they start to break down . now i do n't know if there is some scientific study and all that on this , but i agree that consuming it right away is the best thing to do . if you do n't mind my asking , did your daily schedule prevent you from drinking the juice as soon as you make it ? i know how that goes , it 's a little hard with three kids : ) 
the pillowcase is double sided , anna on one side , elsa on the other . 
there is one twin fitted sheet with pictures of elsa and anna all over it , there is one flat sheet with the violet pattern that you see in the photo . there is one pillow case - it has elsa on one side and anna on the other . i use this as a game with my granddaughter . each night before she goes to bed she decides which sister she will be and sleeps on that side of the pillow . hope this helps . 
no it is 40 cotton and 60 poly . its more stiff than soft . 
i do believe so lorraine . and btw my little one loves her frozen sheets ! 
yes one side is of anna and elsa . its beautiful the characters are big in the middle from top to bottom , the borders are purple . the other side is white with flowers , if you can see the fitted sheet of the bed its exactly like that with big flowers . 
yes ... ... 
not in a box 
the inventory shown is all currently available . thank you for your inquiry . 
just a standard pillow . 
it will be too big for a crib mattress . my daughter 's twin measures about 39 x 75 inches and these fit perfect . 
i ordered this item from amazon . it was a comforter only . you will have to purchase pillow case and sheets separately . 
just the comforter . i bought the matching sheet set separate . 
yes 
yes it is . 
it 's light purple 
there is one pillow case for the twin sheet set which comes with one flat and one fitted sheet . good quality as well . 
the blanket is not slippery . it 's actually very comfortable and cozy . my daughter is a very wild sleeper and i 've been surprised the blanket remains on her every night , unlike many other blankets she 's had . 
no this is just the comforter ... the sheet set must be purchased separately 
yes it is ! the other side is girly and pink i actually like the other side better 
yes 
the device has 2 options , 1 is 1080p , the other is 720p . so it is up to you to choose . 
yes - the enko enko mini composite hdmi to rca cvbs av converter ( input : hdmi ; output : av ) has a hdmi input to the av rca connections . the tv will have the older av connections output from the converter while the xbox has the hdmi input to the converter . 
the laptop hdmi is usually a `` mini '' hdmi connector . therefore you may require an hdmi `` mini '' to standard hdmi adaptor that will accept the enko composite adaptor . as long as your dvd player , or vcr accepts the rca a v inputs you should not have a problem . 
set the audio output mode for the apple tv : with your apple remote , select settings & gt ; audio & video . change the audio output setting from auto to 16 bit . turn off the dolby digital out setting ( your tv or receiver may not be properly detecting a dolby digital signal ) : with your apple remote , select settings & gt ; audio & video . change the dolby digital out setting from on to off . 
the mini it self is a converter , the micro usb is used to power the converter . 
it comes with a mini usb power cable and can be powered from a tv usb port or a standard usb wall plug . note that the device has a mini usb connection not the micro usb connection that most newer devices and cell phones have . 
hi , thank you for contacting us however our product can be used in transmitting any thing that is already sending a video signal it does not have to video outs if you have any other questions please feel free to ask thank you . 
yes , the usb cable provided with enko product is a mini , but it is useful providing power to the device only . this device takes a hdmi standard cable signal and converts it to an rgb signal . 
i only use this device with an n64 . there is no button input lag or loss of picture quality . 
most newer tv 's have a usb connection , i believe it comes with a usb cord for power , use the tv 's usb port to power it up . if you tv does n't have a usb port then get a basic usb adapter for power , like a phone charger . hope this helps . 
that was exactly my situation . i had a vcr that only output composite video and stereo audio ( y- video , white and red - left and right audio ) . you connect this device to the y-w-r outputs from the vcr , then connect the hdmi cable between this device and your tv ( or av receiver ) . it 's that simple . to power the device , you must also connect a usb cable to anything in your equipment rack that also has a usb port . newer tvs and av receivers have usb ports . you will need a usb cable that is long enough to reach your power source ( i had to replace the one they sent me with one of my own ) and of course the y-w-r cable that connects between your vcr and the device , which you should already have assuming the vcr was previously connected to an older piece of equipment . it worked like a charm . 
i had the same issue until i realized the unit had to be plugged into a power source via the usb in order to work . mine has worked great ever since . have you tried that ? 
you should be able to attach it but i do n't know how recording will go considering the recorder itself would n't be able to put out 1080p . sorry i just use it to play my old gaming systems . 
i do n't think so , this device suppose to enable connecting new hdmi devices into old composite connection and translate sound and image accordingly . to write record or burn dvds using a pc would require a software like nero toast etc . these softwares prepare media prior to fit a dvd before it does it . i assume you could record onto your pc by this would require a recording or a grabbing software . unless someone has more enlightened answer that 's the best of my knowledge . 
yes , rca on input , hdmi out to tv . 
sure will . most importantly you will also need a source of usb power for the device as well . if your receiver has a usb port , you 're fine and can use that . if not any cell phone charger should probably do the trick as well . comes with a usb cable but not the ac adapter . works great ! 
i specifically bought this converter so that i could hook up my original wii to my a v receiver over hdmi . i am not hooked up to a 4k source , but my receiver is a newer yamaha hdmi receiver and this product let me easily connect the wii to it . the picture and sound are both great . 
no , it works the other way round . composite -- to -- & gt ; hdmi 
hi melissa , the note 10.1 ( 2014 ) will indeed fit inside the holder . the note 10.1 has a width of approx . 6.7 '' and the holder is designed to fit a width between 6-8.5 inches . this tablet has also been tested and fits securely with the inverted rubber grips inside the holder . for extra security , the holder should also be able to fit the note 10.1 with a protective case on . 
theoretically , it could work , but it would really depend on what position you wanted to be in . fully extended , the arm is only about 18 '' long , so if you wanted to lay on your back and use it with your tablet hovering over your head , it would work as long as you 're laying with your head close enough to the wall . 
does not securely hold an ipad2 with otter defender case . 
additional mounting bases available soon here : http : amzn.com b00mtwuneu 
dear customer : movement is left & right . up & down . 
it rotates left to right too . there is a joint right behind where the tablet sits that lets the tablet rotate . but the big joints only go forward and back . but you still get plenty of viewing and rotating from side to side . 
no ... it is 4 3 4 inches thick when folded completely up so it does not fold flat 
yes , the back is completely flat , so you should be able to attach adhesive strips . there are 4 grooves that should not affect the placement . however , we can not guarantee how well adhesive strips will hold the weight since this was not designed for that use . please check their weight capacity along with the stand and tablet weight and carefully test to make sure this will hold . 
yes . but you need to use screws to mount it 
the unit hangs down 4.75 inches from the bottom of the cabinet . the white mounting bracket is screwed to the bottom of the cabinet . you can remove the unit from the bracket if needed . the white mounting bracket is not visible at all . i hope this helps . 
yes , it will accommodate a standard twin mattress ( 39 '' x 75 '' ) , less than 8 '' thick for safety . 
it 's 4 boxes on 1 pallet . 
the distance between the rungs is 10 '' . 
on this model stairs are not available ... only built-in ladder rungs . thanks , bunk bed kingdom 
yes , you could purchase an additional chest and use them back to back . 
no , it only goes together as pictured , with the desk to the left and ladder to the right . 
it is pine wood with mdf for strength on the tops of the casegoods ( chest , bookcase and desk ) . 
the desk measures 29 '' long , when extended . 
it only goes together as pictured with the ladder on the right . 
it 's mostly hardwood , but there is some mdf used on the tops and sides of the chest and desk . 
do n't unscrew from the base , the tops come off . 
yes , that is exactly what i have - imported from italy . no damage what-so-ever to the ceramic tile . 
i suppose you could . you would need to drill the holes through the bracket which is a type of hard plastic . you would need to drill those holes in the narrow space between the containers . the bracket is about 1 4 thick but hollow . the mounting they come with works well . 
i always fill them on the shower wall . very easy to do . since these dispensers slip into a mount , i imagine you could easily also take them off to fill them . we love these dispensers . they work amazingly well , and the quality is excellent . 
i ordered and installed just one dispenser . if you have a three ganged dispenser send it back and order three separate ones . 
do n't know if this will help , but one of my containers has clairol o o herbal essences hello hydration conditioner . in my opinion it is fairly thick and the dispenser works fine with it . you could check the thickness out at a store and compare it to your nexxus . 
11.5 '' x 10.5 '' x 4 '' approximately . 
yes and it stays put.my shower is fiberglass and i love it ! its very easy to put up as well.make sure you give it 24 hours for the silicon glue to attach to your shower wall and you are good to go.you will not be disappointed.finally no more shampoo bottles falling down .

the dimensions are listed as : full queen 88 '' by 90 '' ; the king is 90 '' by 108 '' , and the twin twin xl is 68 '' by 90 '' . 
i bought a queen fit my queen perfect i have a bedskirt on my bed 
nope 
it 's a queen . 
88inx88in 
i have full queen and it is really full size not queen 
a duvet cover is actually a cover for a comforter . so the all season down comforter could have a duvet cover over it for decorative or just simply protective purposes ... . like pillow cases 
a duvet cover goes over the comforter . 
not sure ! i got the king size ! we have a queen sized bed ... but after reading someone else 's review ... decided to go with the king as well to let it hang more off the sides . the length is extra long ... but i just fold it back when i make the bed ! we do n't fight over covers . love my comforter ! ! ! 
yes you can ! its just a matter of tightening or loosening a part . no tools are needed , and takes a matter of a few seconds , so switching back and forth , if needed , is super fast and easy ! 
i believe it will , as the slicer blade and the coring blade can be adjusted out over the way , or in the case of the corer removed . hope this helps . i know from apples to pie in oven in ten min ! 
it 's done thatway so it fits into the box . you just unscrew it and put it the right way . i believe there were instructions to do that in the box ... 
i do n't know about the warranty part , but there is no way i would ever put it in the dishwasher . 
they are about 1 4 inch thick , spiral cut . one slice thru with a knife and then you have an apple worth of half moon slices . i know its 10 min to make an apple pie . 
we have about 20 bosc pears we are waiting to ripen completely off the tree . jury is still out , but it might work if you cut the stem off , and maybe adjust the knife . 
the box says `` made in taiwan '' by be lih do co. , ltd 
no . you can only adjust it to slice or to not slice at all . 
yes it slices it into a real pretty spiral that can break off into perfect pieces . 
hello p. , if you purchase a 6 drawer captains bed then you can put the drawers on either side of the bed , the other side will be an open space , usually people put that side against a wall so that you do not see the back side of the drawers . if you have the space you can also buy this bed with the 12 drawer option ... .that is 6 drawers per side ... the cost is more for this option . thanks , drew 
hello , the discovery world furniture captains beds are made of pine not particle board no press board . thanks , drew 
not if you order has already shipped if the order has not yet shipped or you have not yet placed and order than we would have to create a 12 drawer package for you ( $ 200 extra for the 2nd set of 6 drawers . ) if the order has shipped or you bought the bed elsewhere we can not sell you the drawers alone , as they do not ship well and it would cost $ 150++ for shipping to crate the drawers and even then that would not guarantee a safe delivery , very delicate piece to try to deliver . thanks , drew 
hello , i am sorry but the fullsize captains bed only comes in merlot and honey . thanks , drew 
no , the size of the drawers is the same . 
yes

thank you for your inquiry . when the side rails are raised to their upper level , the bottom of the side rail is 10 inches above floor level . i hope this is helpful to you .

sorry - i do n't know because it was a gift but i can find out after 12 25 . 
you will have instructions with uour dehydrator . recipes ? you really do n't need any . any fresh fruit can be dried . i 've dried tomatoes . i even took small pieces of turkey , sprinkled a little seasoning on meat and made turkey jerky . 
china 
definitely ! we actually bought this specifically to do jerky of all varieties . 
i can only say that this dehydrator is smaller and takes longer than any other dehydrator i have ever had . i use them primarily for making jerky and my first batch took all night and half the morning on the highest heat setting . watch that set timer as well , i had mine turn off in the middle of the night because i assumed it should have been done by then and the meat just sat uncooked for hours . had to toss that whole batch . ca n't answer the watt or range questions because i do n't have the unit with me . 
i think it 's saying 3x faster than other dehydrators . i do n't know if that 's true . dehydrators take awhile to use . as far as the watts it 's 400w , and it heats up to 156f . it 's a fantastic dehydrator , works like a champ . i 've made all sorts of dried fruits , and dried herbs . i actually loved it so much i bought another one for my mom for christmas who seems to love it too . she frequently uses it to make jerky treats for her dog . it 's a good size , but is n't going to take over your kitchen counter . it 's also really quiet . i let mine run all night long and did not even notice it while trying to sleep . hope this helps ! 
yes 
i would contact company on box and have you sent one . or go online to get one . most recipes are the same type you just have to watch it .

hello yes , the inside is also made of stainless steel . our mugs will keep your drinks warm for an extended period of time , although we should point out that they are not vacuum nor thermos flasks . hope that helps . jessica hall customer service team living concept 
unfortunately i ca n't tell if it 's us made , but the quality is very good . 
standard 
yes two plain white zipped covers . 
4 inches . they 're 21x15x4 . they say `` twin '' or standard , but they 're actually not the same as a regular twin pillow . i 've found that the jumbo size is between a regular twin standard and a queen sized pillow you 'd buy at a bedding store . the jumbo fits in a king pillow case with about 10 inches to spare at the end , but it 's not baggy in width . i ca n't speak to the twin fit in a standard pillow case , but it will fit , the case will be oversized on it , though . 
yes 
17 x 25 inches , measuring seam to seam on the coverlet . 
the home shopping network ( hsn ) website offers the pillowcases as a separate item in various colors . 
they seem as thick , however i do n't think they protect from hot temperatures as well as the originals . they are only good for small hands . 
two are the same . no difference . can be used in either hand . 
that statement by jim t. is accurate . 
ours shipped from china . 
no . but because of the peculiarities of my kitchen layout , i have to carry 400 degree pans for a distance of about four feet and these gloves work perfectly . if these gloves get stained , hand wash them . i put mine through the washing machine and they shrank slightly -- but not enough to prevent me from using them ! ! 
they did come in the original package . by tags , not sure what you mean . they had bar code on packaging and i do n't remember if there were any tags on them . i had purchased one in a store a couple years ago and loved it . these were iddntical , just cleaner . i really like these gloves . so easy to slip on and off ... .i have . arthritis in my hands so i needed the ease of on and off plus easy flexibility . i hope this helps . 
yes 
yes , it was a pair . size i would say would be a medium 
as far as i can tell they are the real deal , original gloves . he box and everything is identical to the boxes and gloves sold at a retail store . 
they stack fairly well but you 're going to need some pretty tall cabinets to stack the larger ones ! i only stack two of the shorter ones . 
no , the only stamp on the bottom of each glass is a number . i believe the name `` luminarc '' is used for these glasses as a type of heavy-duty , 10-sided , every-day usage type of glass , and not the french manufacturer . 
yes , they will and it 's hard to pull apart- i put one up and one down to fill shelf then extras on the tops of the ones that are upside down- otherwise the rim will break off trying to get them loose-if stacked inside each other- i had to adjust my shelves to fit the whole set-but it 's worth it-we use the smaller more than the large so i put a a few large in another cabinet . 
10 large glasses , 10 small glasses , and 10 lids 
no 
these glasses are the standard french jelly jars i have always purchased . i will say that they probably do . i wish i had kept my old lids . also , you might notice that they offer red lids as an extra add-on so , i bet they would ? not a definitive 100 % but a close 95 % ! 
i have used them in the freezer to store red chili sauce i make with no problem but they are not pyrex and i broke one in the microwave once . so freezer is ok but not for use in the oven or microwave , in my experience . 
they are made in the usa according to the crate & barrel product page . http : www.crateandbarrel.com working-glasses-and-lid f1693 here is the luminarc page http : www.luminarc.org the-brand dinnerware-manufacturer % 281 % 29.aspx 
yes 
i finally got around to checking the box . yes , they are made in the usa . 
all i did was wet the feet with a little water and push easy leg down . i do have a glass cutting board that stays on my counter that i stuck it to . you have to push pretty hard . 
the extended platform catches the noddles as the form it 's pretty handy 
they send you a copy of their pdf recipe book if you give the company your e-mail . once you receive your product , they send a follow up e-mail for you to sign up for one . 
i asked support about this before and was advised to do it this way : use your right arm to hold onto the vertical stand , where the active blade is ; and use the left hand to turn the spindle . the girl in the youtube video actually showed it could be done pretty easily : http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=dissjrx3wko 
yes it can work very well with big and long vegetables . there 's no container holding the vegs and it actually works better if the veg is thicker . 
since they are close in price , i would go for the brieftons . i am so pleased with mine . 
i think it depends on your needs . were you comparing it to the pencil sharpening kind of spiralizer ? this tri blade thingy is certainly bigger ( probably about 7 - 8 times as big ) , however its size is still quite manageable . i have both , and there 's no reason not to have both . i use the tri blade for big occasions when i have to serve a bigger group of people . my small spiral slicer is what i use when i 'm feeding just myself as it 's easier to take it out and put it away and clean too . 
this spiralizar has the highest rating , about the same quality as the paderno but comes with better customer service , price and guarantee . here is a complete comparison of this and some other models : 
yes i 'm able to spiralize sweet potatoes and winter squash easily with it . 
everything ... they want a happy customer 
this new model has cord storage in the back . that is the only difference between this fan and the previous model . 
mine sits on carpet but has never tipped over . try putting a board underneath it . 
good question -- -it is pretty quiet , but if you have it on full speed it can get a little loud , but i still think you could hear the baby . i had in the living room with about 12 people in it and we did n't have to turn up the volume on the tv and it really helps circulate the air when it is warm out . 
when the oscillation feature is selected , the front grilll will rotate . 
if that 's what you are looking for , you will not find such in this make and model . this holmes blizzard is one of the quietest fans yet ! keep shopping ! 
yes and fairly easily . 
no bad smell from my fan . love it . works beautifully . 
it is powerful so it may work as a floor fan . i have it on top of chest of drawers and it is probably to big for that but i make it work . 
unfortunately no . 
quiet fan under all conditions . perfect fan . minimal noise . 
i brought one from amazon and i live in china mainland . it is 110v ( us standard ) so u will have to get an adapter or u will want to find eu model of this fan all dyson products i bought from amazon.com ( us ) only work with 110v 
i have a two room condominium , with full kitchen and bath , 750 sq feet , as well as an open porch , in atlanta , where it is generally very hot all summer . the dyson is just fabulous . i have two . it will clear the air a good 20-30 feet . i really like the rotation of it . it helps me save on my air-conditioning costs . the heat function also is perfect for our mild winters here . i very much recommend the dyson . 
the front of the opening in 12 '' and the back is 10 '' . it is the new quiet dyson . so far so good . i recommend it . ajo 
yes . wind volume is not very strong and i dont think it is quiet . 
it is very quiet , almost like a breeze thru the window or white noise . 
110v 
no it 's desk mounted 
19 3 4 inches from table top to peak 
of course it does , it 's a fan ... 
we live in usa , florida and it 's 110v which is fine for here . works amazingly well and quiet . 
i use it as a circulation tool in a 21x30 room and it has lowered the temp by 4 degrees over just using the a c. works , well 
9.1 x 9.1 x 39.6 inches ; 9 pounds 
do n't get it wet v 
does only cold . if i recall , dyson discontinued the model with both heat & cold . 
120v 60hz 0.8 a hope that helps ! great fan 
hi ! this is exactly why i purchased this ! i wanted to save on energy by decreasing the central air usage . in my experience , this is great for a large room or open space . it wo n't sub for central air on another level of the house . i have a large living-dining area that is cooked just fine with this on the highest setting on the sweeping motion . hope this helps . their website gives specific dimensions for cooling area ... . 
the light is n't dimmable , and you ca n't disable it . 
i think you can order one from dyson for whatever type fan you have . go to their web site and search . 
no 
it does not beep at all , changing speeds , turning on or off , or oscillating 
although low fat milk products will be easier to froth than high fat creams , there 's a lot to know about frothing milk ! i 've had mixed ( and frustrating ) results since i started frothing and after some research , i 've have narrowed down the must do things to make good frothed coffee : # 1 your milk product must be super fresh . i dig thru the cooler at the supermarket to find the farthest out expiration date i can ! just because it 's not expired , does n't mean it 's fresh . # 2 make sure your milk is just out of the refrigerator cold . because i drink more than one cup of coffee , i used to let the milk container sit on the countertop between cups . big mistake . put it back in the frig and keep it cold . # 3 make sure your coffee is ready for the froth before it 's done frothing . the bubbles you create will immediately begin to disappear when the frother stops moving . when removing the pitcher from the frother , swirl the pitcher in your hand , keeping it moving on the way to your cup . # 4 finally , depending on your coffee machine , your coffee might be too hot . if the froth hits coffee that 's too hot the bubbles will disappear . i make a generous amount of froth and then add about 1 4 of it to the coffee and use a spoon to mix it in , tempering the coffee a bit , then slowly adding the remainder of foam on top . it 's an art but worth mastering in my opinion . good luck !

in contrast to steam frothing used by coffee shops , this product ( as the nespresso and others , froths the milk by steering and mixing it with air . by doing that the end result is a very thick foam that is not hot , and depends on the starting temperature of the milk and the ambient air . the results are similar if not better than the nespresso frother , but at half the price . the `` thickness '' and consistency of the foam depends on the % of fat in the milk , the more the thicker . 
it 's a non-stick ( teflon ) material . 
the two attachments - the large one is for frothing , the other is for keeping the milk stirred moving . all you need to do is put on the frothing attachment , hit the heat button , and it makes heated , frothed milk . 
yes , i have used almond milk and it works fine . 
does basiclly the same thing but at a cheaper price . quality is surprisingly good . mine has performed flawlessly for a year . so happy i gave them to my sisters for christmas . 
there are two frothed attachments : one has the round spring and the other is a little plastic piece . for lattes use the plastic piece and you can fill it to the max . for cappuccino 's use the spring but you need to keep it at the min level . make sure lid is on good and rubber gasket is not defected . it ha happened to me on occasion . trial and error but i love it . hope this helps 
500 watts 
i have this same machine and i only use whole milk . it froths mine beautifully . i did once try half and half and that did not froth , but no issues with the whole milk . 
the information provided on the site says it is a medium weight comforter . it is plenty warm for me . i would not want anything heavier . my only problem is that , as a king size , it does not fit in my washer so i will have to take it to a commercial laundry . 
i have not used bleach . i suggest you check with the maker of the comforter . 
i do n't know as i purchased the king size which was described as being 90 '' wide x 106 '' long . i do love the comforter . 
i bought these solely based on size , i was very disappointed when i received these . dimensions listed are way off for a pillow . actual dimensions are 20 '' x 12 '' and i 'm rounding up ! 
nowhere that i know of . i had to sew my own because they swim in standard cases . i bought tees at goodwill , sewed them into the right size with the neck hole on the back side to use as the pillow insert . the stretch of tees is great to get the pillows positioned as you like without hampering the way traditional case materials do . 
yes . you will receive ( 2 ) pillows but they are a bit smaller than a standard sized pillow . 
yes you will receive 2 pillows 
yes it is 100 % micro beads ! i love my pillows , they form to your neck and i have no crooks or pain in my neck and shoulders now : ) definitely worth it ! 
no , they do not . 
i do n't know . they sent me tge wrong items . ordered 2 pillows but received two pillow inserts that are supposed to keep u cool . sorry . 
like other people have posted , my unit arrived with no bonus packs even though the packaging clearly states bonus there are bonus packs inside . i do n't know if it is an innocent oversight or more malicious involvement . 
the answer i got from keurig is that it is a misconception that the k145 replaced the b145 , they are the same unit . the k and b designate different marketing distribution , both being intended for business office use . keurig told me that the b145 is not discontinued as someone once reported . it is important to note that the k b145 is quite a bit different from the home model , the k45 . my review of both the k145 and the b145 are posted to try to clarify the differences between them and the home model . 
keurig recently changed the cup holder to have larger ridges inside . this prevents it from using re-usable k-cups . irritating as hell . from what i can tell , it started with the october build dates . 
free shipping to us physical addresses . fedex will not deliver to po boxes and thus there is an additional charge . 
well this is my experience with the k145 office pro model . the machine in my office will take a generic reusable k-cup filter , however , the same model in my home would not . i had to research which reusable filter was compatible and that would be an ekobrew . it fits fine and coffee brews perfectly through it . the ekobrew reusable k-cup filter can be purchased through amazon or at wal-mart for about $ 7.99 or so . i hope this helps , good luck . 
chris , it can comfortably hold a 7 incher ... 
standard k cup does work in this model and similar versions of k cups from grocery stores 
i think this would be a perfect machine . i got it because it has the stronger motor and should last longer . my old one was pretty but through constant use it only lasted about a year and my neighbor is having the same problem . that 's why this time i went with the pro . 
mine makes noise so i guess it 's normal for this machine my other ones did not make notice 
13 '' high , 10 '' wide , 12 '' deep 
the exterior dimensions of the bmo734xl quick touch microwave are 20.5 '' ( l ) x 18 '' ( w ) x 12.5 '' ( h ) . the interior dimensions are 13 '' ( w ) by 13 '' ( d ) by 9 '' ( t ) ( from the plate to the cavern roof ) and the plate is 12 '' round . 
1.2 cu . ft . 
1100 watts 
sure you can , the clearance seems to apply more to the sides while the top clearance seems to be more for circulation in an enclosed cabinet . mine is mounted on the counter with several objects on top without an issue . by the way , this microwave is the bomb , glad i bought it . 
this oven is very quiet as compared to older models . you can easily have a conversation over it . the beeps are also adjustable to a very low volume . it does have a little vibration noise when running from the metal case around the oven . i lean a silicone pot holder against it to quiet it . 
no ... .the on screen light goes into a `` standbye '' mode ... the light goes out after a few moments on non-use but the clock time is still displayed . you can also have the clock time not displayed if you wish . 
yes . mine does . but i do n't leave it open for extended periods so i do n't know if it would go off after a while or not . 
being a present owner of this microwave i 've found the 8 '' clearance to the sides necessary for proper ventilation but the back does not require it and you can get away with a lot less space overhead if you do n't have it . 
i do n't think that quite , but works very well . 
the display of the bmo734xl quick touch microwave is lit and can be seen in the dark while it is active . when it is in sleep mode it will not be visible in the dark . the clock is designed for a 12 hour display . 
it does come with one that is vacuum powered so do not expect miracles . had a kenmore once that had a separate motor for the attachment and that would pick up anything . hope this helps . 
yes . there is a washable primary filter but the hepa exhaust filter must be replaced . 
the quality of the panasonic far surpasses the hoover.. i have owned several hoovers . since finding the panasonic i wo n't be buying another hoover . 
the hepa filter should n't have to be replaced for years . they can be washed out and reused , you might want to get one more to use when you rinse one ( wet ) . i do n't know where you can buy them . i will look on amazon with make and model numbers . 
yes , it has a hepa filter . it also has a general filter that can be washed . 
the power head is multi purpose . adjusts up and down , 
yes 
i do n't know personally ... but the owner 's manual says yes since height is adjustable . 
yes 
this vacuum does a much better than average job on stairs . the motorized head is light and swivels easily . it has great pick-up , and a light on the head . the entire vacuum is very light and easy to carry on stairs . the crevice tools los work well on stairs . the long cord is plenty for he stirs in most homes . 
you would actually boil your water seperate then transfer to the teapot 
made in china stamped on bottom of pot . i do really like the pot , but i had hoped it was made in england 
it is unlikely because ( 1 ) it is made in china , ( 2 ) the lid did not fit the pot [ no indent to sit flat and keep the lid from falling off ] , ( 3 ) i thought to use it for a pot of tea , but after heating the pot with hot water and dumping it - i noticed the inside of the pot was covered in black spots that could not be removed . i wanted to return it - but the company said i could keep it and they would refund my money . it is an embarrassment to have `` english tea '' associated with the name . i threw it in the trash . do not waste your money . buy an authentic brown betty teapot or other name brand - cheap price means a cheap product . 
it does not say microwaveable . 
i use tea bags with my pot but i would think that you could not just use loose tea with this pot unless you like to read tea leaves . there are several small holes leading to the spout . 
the filters are quite large and easy to access . simply pull off the front cover of the air filter unit . i would guess you could give them a good vacuum from time to time . it is recommended that you replace the filters once a year but you may need to do that more frequently if you have problems with the cat hair . 
i hope you mean labs as in dogs and not as in mad scientist . the machine should work , but a couple of weeks ago mine stopped working . no warning , just stopped . i 've been too busy to call and complain but i will . it 's too expensive to conk out . 
there are 2 filters . a high deodorization anti-odor carbon filter and a hepa filter . replacement will vary depending on how often you use the filter . when you do change the filters it is recommend that you replace them . do not wash or reuse . 
all the electrolux pureoxygen air cleaners are energy star compliant . this particular model consumes the following number of watts per fan speed : 10 30 47 110w . electrolux recommends to use the auto mode feature . this feature will operate the air cleaner based on air quality in the surrounding environment as well as the availability of day light . by operating the unit in auto mode , the air cleaner will consume the least amount of energy over time . 
this is not a vacuum . i suggest vacuuming first -- especially the drapes ( washing them , too ) . hopefully there are no serious mold-spores growing amongst the walls in a musty old house . ( a fumigating may be necessary . ) i suppose that on a medium high speed , this machine would most likely really help clean the air . as i mentioned in my review , it has really helped my father -- who lives along a dusty street with lots of flowers tress . he told me again yesterday that it has helped clear his sinuses . 
filters el049 hepa , el050 carbon , and el043 hepa and carbon set all work on this unit . el049 hepa is $ 52.22 , el050 carbon is $ 50.33 , and el043 hepa and carbon set is $ 97.5 . thank you . 
not that i know of - i 'd call the customer service number and ask , or e-mail them . 
if they were really big cupcakes i think so . it measures 5.5 inches across but the sticks that attach it are at the widest 1.5 inches apart . 
it 's a mix of both gold and silver . it was really nice though . the cake icing was white with purple and blue flowers cascading and the topper was perfect . 
hi corinne , thank you for contacting us . yes we can make `` bride '' cake topper . we 'll complete the posting today and hopefully it will be available for your purchase later today or early tomorrow . please check back this section for update . thank you , customer service all about details 
hi deborah , we 're on process of releasing gold color for this design . it will be available by tomorrow . if you want to receive a notice , please drop us a message ( contact seller ) . you can refer to this link - 
hi kate , yes , there will be a gold color for this product . limited quantity will be released later this week . if you want to receive an advance notice , please drop us a message ( contact seller ) . you can refer to this link - 
the back is the shimmer gray cardstock . there 's no glitter . if you zoom the 5th picture , an arrow points to shimmer gray cardstock . 
it is 100 % silver ! 
no . all copper . 
they are 3 1 2 inches tall and 3 1 4 inches wide on the inside of the lip . 
the handle is very sturdy . i just tried to pull it off and could n't . they are visible , but they are the same color as the mug , so they are very noticeable . 
hi scott , thank you for contacting us . these mugs measure 4 inches in height . thank you ! 
hello , as with many copper items , our mugs are made in india . thank you for your interest ! 
190 grams 
hello , these are indeed solid copper mugs . 
this mug is made of 100 % solid copper metal sheet and are neither lacquered nor coated or plating . this mug is well treated in state of art advance technology laboratory and it is fda approved for drinking purpose . 
when you order , they give you a date and time for delivery at check out . i believe you can change it to a date and time that is later than they one they initially offer . i changed mine to an afternoon delivery rather than the morning delivery they offered . 
no , they are screwed into the frame . 
34 x 80.5 x 33 inches 
i love it ! ! it 's much more comfortable than i expected though you can feel the buttons , and is big enough for two people to lay out when extended . i like it up when it 's just me , though . : ) 
the `` mattress '' dimensions when the couch is folded down is approximately 42 '' x 72 '' . however , i would n't recommend using this as a bed every night ; it 's a very firm couch . 
maybe if you 're a really big dude ? i 'm a slender female and i just had to shred the one box it 's shipped in . two people could probably carry it , but it 's heavy . 
yes 
barly- certainly very uncomfortabley 
it is terribly rock hard . no one in my family liked it . we bought it for our kids gaming room . kids usually could care less but both my kids did not like it . the good thing is that with amazon we were able to return it . 
smaller than average if ur a big person like me but comfortable 
the dehydrator temperature of the air is just right enough to dry the food but not cook it . cooking the meat is matter of preference but i personally prefer to do proper marination and dehydrating ... short answer , cooking is not necessary . 
the maintained temperature during operation is at approx 155-165f . 
i have done both at the same time with no flavor transfer at all . if you plan on making jerky just make sure you wash it well before you use it again . 
it has 6 trays . i was able to thinly slice 2 apples and a single banana . we did n't plan to a lot with this product . 
it is bpa free . thanks ! 
not that i have found . the unit has only an on off switch . i have n't had any problem with the temperature . i just check periodically to see how the drying is going . it has worked well for us so far . 
they have sheets you could use but those are separate purchase . yes too big 
the closest i saw in the instruction book is fruit leather . traditional roll ups are mad from pured fruit on sheets placed in a dehydrator . this has open trays to allow air circulation . you dry the piece of fruit rather than spread on sheets . i did pineapple slices that are delicious ! 
no 
i have dried fruit and jerky with very minimal sticking if any . the non-stick trays , i believe , would be more for drying purees . 
contact the manufactuer ocean sales at 1-800-605-6046 they can help you with troubleshooting and exchanges . 
there should be an instruction manual . on the front above the 'plus ' plaque , ' there 's a grey-colored 'knob . ' turn the knob to the left and remove it-then , pour the the water into that canister . 
i wash my in the washer - but do not dry . so far so good ! 
no that is not normal . i can see and feel the steam coming out of my mop . make sure you have plent of water in the holder , plug it in and wait until you can see the steam coming out . you may need to hit it gently on the floor if there is no steam after maybe 10 minutes . if none of this works , you may have a defective mop . mine steams lots ! gay 
yes mine does 
just bought this last week . comes with 4 pads . 
i use distilled & so far , there 's no residue . 
yes but do n't leave water puddle behind 
yes ! but , just keep at it . overall , it 's a good mop ! 
i bought at a home show , and while they did not include a recipe , per se , they do say `` clean once a month by running [ with ] distiller water and vinegar to loosen buildup within the tank '' . hope this helps 
yes . the ring opens and closes 
hi wendy , the cups are made in china . they are made of the highest quality materials and our cups go through rigorous testing to ensure they meet our ( and our customers ' ) standards . these cups meet all necessary us regulations , and by using reputable and trusted manufacturers in china we are able to bring you a great quality product at an affordable price . i hope this helps with your enquiry . please let us know if you have any further questions . brightspring 
the length is 7 '' including handle . hope that works for you 
it measures 3 1 4 '' across 
well ... i just measured it . 250 ml of water from my pyrex will overflow the metal cup . so the metal measuring cup is an actual cup , not 250 ml . i use my pyrex for liquids & # 9786 ; 
i have not tried what you ask but i would guess that the rubber handles are not heat resistant . i did not see anywhere on the product that the handles were silicon heat resistant . you could send an email to bright springs and ask . 
cups are stainless steel , not sure about the 18 10. can say that i do n't think the handles are as gutsy as i had hoped . they bend easily when digging in flour or other dense indredients . 
depends on your water source and how much you use the maker . we change ours every 3 months 
they did n't say . but they are too large and misshapen to fit into my keurig . 
i have used this type of replacement filter for about six months . each filter seems to work as well as the name brand . i see no difference - except price . 
sorry , do n't know 
i believe they are 
yep ! the vue and the standard keurig both seem to use the same filter holder . i actually am using a filter holder for an original keurig in my vue , and it 's working just fine . 
inside the water container near the bottom 
yes 
no . the ge aros is equipped with a built in hooker retention device . 
all products on the wink line can be shared between accounts allowing other users to have full control of the product . in this case , if multiple users have control of aros in the wink app , it will perform energy saving `` auto-away '' features only when all users connected to the unit are gone , and will not enter `` auto-away '' mode if any of the users are home . 
this unit is terrible as far as the noise level is concerned ! in a bedroom ? really ... how could you sleep ? the low setting is the same as my samsung on high ! they failed miserably in this area ! ! ! ! ! ! i think the samsung is going back in as this is unbearable ! 
yes but it 's removable from the right side so unless your unit sticks out past the wall window sill , you 'll have to pull the whole unit out of the window to remove it . 
if your androids are consistently overheating then this would be a suitable device to lower their temperature , yes 
as of right now we only have the window model of aros available , but this is something we are exploring for the future . 
they are gon na get in . just installed mine and those new curtain features look nice and sound good but they have quite a few gaps for insects to get in . 
it can cool a room ~17 x 20 feet . 
as of right now the wink app is only available for apple and android devices , going forward we may be looking into windows . 
as of right now no . however , we are exploring different btu size units that will fit smaller windows . 
60 x 30 
30in x 60in 
yes it is from the disney store . 
it measures in increments of 0.1 oz accurately . 
when you turn it on , it responds pretty much instantaneously , and the readout for weighing items is just about as fast . there is no waiting , in my experience . 
it is made in china 
6 '' wide , 9-1 2 '' long , about 1 2 '' thick . 
i see ounces , grams , ml , fluid ounces 
mesures in grams kg , oz and lbs . 
a scale cant ... that is volumetric measurement and not weight measured . however water has a density of 1 gram per 1 milliliter . so if you weight out 120 grams of water it is also 120 ml . 
my understanding is that it enables you to hang the scale on the wall . 
yes . 
i use a bunn 10 cup and had grounds with the paper filters . i 've made full pots for about a week with the reusable filter and have n't had the overflow problem or grounds in my coffee . 
yes 
the bottom of this basket is a little bit over 3 1 4 inches ... .i do n't have a bunn hg , so , i am not sure if this would work for you or not ... the height of this basket is about 2 7 8 inches ... ... and , the width across the top is about 4 7 8 inches ... .hope this helps you a little ... ... marie 
i 'm sorry , i ca n't tell for sure , but it should , because it works great in a bunn-o-matic grx-b & it 's a 10-cup . before we got this basket we had big-time problems with the grounds overflowing into the carafe , even using bunn paper filters . we tried cutting down on the grounds , which helped the overflowing problem , but then the coffee was too weak . after this basket , problems solved ! 
this filter was designed to fit bunn bx , btx , grx , nhb , nhs , st , hg and ht models . 
metal 
i 'm not sure but i 'm sure it would . i only have the bottom burner model . good luck . 
not sure . it fits the nhbx perfectly . 
i have no idea 
i think it would fit . i have a velocity , a 'm so . however , it is a bit narrower and some grounds got in the pot . 
first i must say i love my keurig k45 . the color is beautiful and it makes delicious coffee . the largest cup it makes is 10 ounces . however , with the removable tray you could easily and quickly make another cup of coffee to fill a larger cup if you wanted . 
call keurig . in fact , you should always contact the manufacturer first even if the warranty has expired . sometimes they 'll bend the rules or at least protate the cost of a new one . 
yes - you have to purchase a separate little filter and take out the k-cup holder in the keurig itself , but you can use your own grounds . the 2.0 versions of keurig which are the newest models on the market will not allow this . so if you want to brew your own , then you will have to purchase a model number that precedes the 2.0 - which is why i bought this one 
when you make the last cup of coffee shut it off , and drain out whatever water there 's in the container , by not letting the water boil for the next cup it will not be in the tubes , if further questions you 're free to write me , good luck 
i think it 's probably the size of the water tank 
it all depends on the k-cup ( type of coffee ) you purchase . i use bustelo expresso k-cups and the coffee is delicious 
no 
yes . the container can be removed and drained if need be . there is also a cleaning filter that remains in the water container . i recently saw a crazy post on facebook about the hazardso of this ? i replenish water all day with mine , ( office use ) so stagnant water isn '' t a concern . good luck ! 
anna , i 'm not trying to be a smart ass but you should read the manual ... it does make hot chocolate and be sure to run it once without any product after you are done to clean the machine ... ..all in the manual ... 
yes 
no it does not , it automatically shuts off . 
yes 
no 
the scale fluctuates with it 's details until the item on the scale settles and the scale can determine a constant weight . so , if you put the tank on the scale and start filling it with water it will keep changing the reading until you stock and the water settles and it has a constant read for a few seconds . finally , i would wonder if the tank will be able to balance on the scale , it is not that wide . but you will have to decide that . 
i have not experienced this scale exhibit memory that affects subsequent results . 
i have a very small bathroom and love hot showers , and this scale has been great . it 's a great design and very high quality and i have n't experienced any issues with steam , heat or damp . even after a year of wear and tear , display is still crystal clear and scale is still very accurate . this scale is definitely well suited to live in a bathroom . 
this morning i stepped on it and it told me my weight . ( down six pounds ) i understand your confusion , some scales do require a `` tap '' this one does not . i will check tomorrow to be sure . 
kim , i sympathize with you ! my scale is inaccurate also . i 'm going to leave a negative review on amazon . have you communicated with them ? good luck . 
sorry , i ca n't give good opinion on this particular scale as mine arrived defective and i returned it . i have an older scale with tempered glass and have had no problems with it however it is glass so if you are knocking things about you might have to get an old fashioned metal scale . 
when i step on my scales , it automatically gives weight . i do not have on off button . just make sure you have batteries in place hope this helps 
barn wood , fencing , construction sites and pallets . 
i drilled it into the wall . i just used screws and found the stud in the wall and it 's very sturdy . i love this wine rack , 
we can make this out of new cherry wood and finish it with a natural stain . or make it out if pine and finish it with a cherry stain . jim 
i do n't know ... i gave it away as a gift but you can contact the guy who makes them and ask ! 
yes we have a large stockpile of barnwood we could make this from . jim 
$ 99 plus $ 27 to ship lower 48 usa 
send us the size you are looking for . the stain color and the zip code for shipping . we will send u a quote based on that . thanks for looking . jim millen great lakes 
no it will not . you would have to order our liquor rack whiskey rack which will allow for the larger bottles . jim 
overall width is 4-5 inches the inside wine bottle width is 3.25-3.5 inches . jim 
40 inches long x 17-18 inches high . we do custom lengths to fit whatever your application is . jim 
depends on what your putting under the bed . you should have around 6-7 inches of clearance under the bed with this frame . hope this helps . 
no , they are fixed on the frame , they are n't center because in the picture it is showing the frame in the full or queen option . as the bed frame extends to accommodate larger sizes the legs in the middle will be closer to center . i hope this info helps . i bought this frame and could n't be happier ; it 's very sturdy . 
i do n't have risers on mine , but i would assume for proper support you 'd need to have them on all 9 legs . 
yes..you surely can..the headboard attachment is connected to the frame..you just have to turn them to the correct position when assembling it . instructions do come with the package on how to do so..it 's very simple . hope this is helpful . 
yes 
yes and its about 7inches off the floor . 
6 inches . 
not really . we can fit our sneakers and do you remember those old fold up razor scooters ? we have one of those under there too but barely fits . we have small storage bins that do n't fit under the bed , which is a bit disappointing 
we have a king mattress and the front of the mattress hangs over the bottom of the frame so that there is nothing to attach a foot board to . there is something to attach a headboard to if the headboard matches the configuration of the slots in the frame 's headboard brackets . 
yes 
yes . i have a twin over full bunk bed and it fit standard size . 
they can ... .unless you get a memory foam with cooling gel in it . this one does not seem to get too hot , but we use 100 % cotton sheets which seems to really make a difference vs. a polyester blend sheet . hope this helps . 
it could . just make sure you get the appropriate size for your day bed 
the directions suggest at least 24 hours . 
39x75inches ( twin size ) 
it 's a pillow top mattress ... so not flipped but can be rotated . 
no 
not sure but have had a 300 lbs person sleep on it all night and its still 9 inches high without even a dent 
this mattress is all foam so it will bend with an adjustable mattress . 
yes i sometimes sleep on my side , or my stomuch , it 's great anyway i sleep . i feel great in the morning & # 128512 ; 
60 x 75 
the product information says 46 lbs . my husband and i were able to get it in our rv easily . the compressed packaging worked nicely . we spent our first nights on it recently , very comfortable . 
3 year limited warranty , in the short time we have had it , we find it very comfortable , a little bit firm . we are very happy with it . 
mine is in my camper and it has a plywood platform . i would use this mattress on a box spring as well though . 
david - the mattress does not have cool gel in it as far as i know . however , my wife and i sleep cool on it . 
it says in the amazon specs for this product 60 '' x 74 '' x 9 '' 
i do n't know what `` short '' refers to but the dreamfoam bedding is the standard queen size ( 60 '' 79.5 '' ) 
i returned the mattress because i did n't feel comfortable in it . 
it only took about an hour to fully expand 
we put ours on the bed in the morning and slept on it that night . it 's in our camper so once we slept on it the following weekend , we could tell it had expanded more but it was definitely sleepable the same night . 
this is the mattress only . a platform bed would be the best option for this mattress as it is foam . box springs will not work with this mattress . i have two mattresses from this company , the other being latex and for both beds i have cut 2 x 4 's to fit on top of the side rails for my beds for the mattresses to lay on . this works very well and is much less expensive than purchasing a new bed frame or the solid box to put the mattress on . 
no it is a high density foam mattress . i do n't believe it has any memory foam . great value at this price point . 
yes . the box is @ 12 '' x12 '' square x 5 feet long . i 'm sure you could check it and it would probly survive the trip 
yes , it is , and it 's very comfortable 
not at all . 
yes 
no it wont . it 's great for our rv , but the edges have no firm edges , they will likely smash down . the first few times i got out of bed i felt like i was pitched forward , had to compensate for the lack of matress edge . 
it did n't take long . recommended is 24-48 hrs but my girls slept on them 10 hrs later and they were firm and full by then . they have also kept their form . 
no . 
not really sure . i purchased a platform for the mattress . i can say that this is extremely comfortable . i have had guests over the weekend and i slept on it . truly is amazingly comfortable and cozy . 
i 'm sorry , i 'm not sure but you should contact chuck ! he will set you straight larry 
manufacturer indicates that it can be used with box spring or board . we are currently using it with a box spring . great mattress for the price . 
i used a tape measure , so its a roughly right as it did not want to stay exactly . but for the queen i got 60 inches wide and 78 inches for the length . 
it is about 5 ' tall and maybe 18 '' square 50lbs . queen short 
no box spring - just the mattress . 
no ma'am . 
yes it does until i had to get a waterproof cover for the kid and the vinyl did not vent it well at all 
i do n't believe it would fold or roll up easily . this is a memory foam type mattress that is at least 4 '' deep . even if you did get it folded in half , it would take up a lot of room . 
it should . 
mattress is covered with a mattress pad and then sheets , and these are washed weekly . 
60 inches 
it needs a foundation . i put it in a rv with a platform and did n't need a boxspring . if you use it on a regular bedframe you will need a boxspring . 
yes that should work fine . i put mine on top of a toddler car bed and it has slats and bunkie board . as well . and works just fine . its soooo comfortable to .

comes rolled and compressed in a 1.5x1.5x4 ' box.and i was home so i signed for it 
yes you can use it on an adjustable frame , as long as the frame is big enough . i used it on a `` portable frame '' and it is amazingly comfortable and supportive . 
it should be doable for a while but i would n't personally want to have that be permanent . 
yes ... being used on a full queen frame with a full size foundation . works perfectly 
sorry i did n't pay that much attention to the title . i will update my review soon and may be able to address it then . 
this mattress can be used with a platform bed , which is a frame that does n't require a box spring . i would say it 's comfortable enough to be on the floor too . 
i would say it is more like 4-5 in deep , 54 inches high and 15 inches wide . the board is 13 wide but the feet add 2 more inches . it is very sturdy and well made . i love the plate to rest my iron on . i have been looking for a small stand up board to remaining standing in my closet and this is the perfect size . my only concern is that i will not find a replacement cover . 
about 24 inches ... .i sometimes sit in a folding chair if i 'm forced into ironing ! 
on the bottom of the board there is a 3 '' handle along the side . press it upward and the board will close . just be careful to hold it so it wo n't fall on your toes . 
not without a saw 
it is made of a metal so thin and weak that it is almost transparent . by all that is good and holy , please , i implore you , do not throw away your money on this flimsy waste of space . 
so far i have had no problems with the lever . i actually really like the lever because it is perfect height for me ( 5 ' 11 ) and i can adjust it for my girlfriend ( 5 ' 1 ) . so it actually seems well made to me . seems the biggest complaint is it not being sturdy sometimes , in which case i called and they sent me a new one that was . hope that helps . 
not very thick but it works ! ! ! i really am pleased with this smaller version as i did n't want a regular size ironing board ! ! ! ! 
actual length of board . ..36 1 2 inches..plus 7 inch iron rest..great ironing board..very easy to get ..easy storing..does n't take space ironing board is 36 1 2 inches long..plus..attached iron rest ... 7 inches . a great board . easy to get up..and down..easy storage..until one has to do more ironing . who likes to that ! ! 
it does not . it is welded , it 's a continuation of the board itself . the only dynamic parts are the legs . 
i called the company and they told me they are going to be selling a replacement cover in a few months . they told me to check back in three months . 
dimensions : width ( in . ) : table : 43.31 ; bench : 43.31 ; corner : 67.24 height ( in . ) : table : 29.75 ; bench : 17.18 ; corner : 33.87 depth ( in . ) : table : 27.9 ; bench : 12 ; corner : 51.5 
yes you can that 's actually how we have our table right now . luckily in the instruction manual it shows you both ways . warning ! do not use a hand tools like a screw driver . you will need power tools to do this job . there is a lot of screwing together pieces . it took us four hours with a hand screw driver . plus i 'm 6 months pregnant . so that did n't help . in the end the instructions are good just be careful with all the screws some look like each other and it 's great to have a measuring tape handy . 
measuring the top of the bench the short side from end to corner piece is 51 3 8 '' and the long side is 67 1 4 '' these and be placed either way . also note that on the right side of the long seat back the holes are not drilled as long as the required screws ( to save from some frustration use the shorter ones or drill the holes deeper . 
yes i 'm sure you can but i do believe this is just the set but if you look at related products or customer also bought at the bottom of the page it will have other benches 
yes there is ! i did n't know that when i ordered it ! but once we out it together we saw that there is ! love it 
the table is n't attached to the bench so you can move it back and forth . but i am 5'6 and sit comfortably under it at the end . i will say though that the signal outer bench is a bit flimsy . i 'm going to have to have it braced more in the middle . hope this helps ! 
sorry no . this is a set . 
we had the same issue . became a pain and cracked the wood some but eventually got the screws in . 
it 's 45 inches in length and 31 inches wide . i love my nook , it 's surprisingly sturdy also . 
assembly instructions are very clear and detailed and as long as you follow the steps exactly you can assemble this in about 3 hours give or take . the key t the whole process is to follow the instruction step by step otherwise you 'll end up taking things apart . 
four screw holes . one at the top and bottom of each wire that runs vertical along the outside of the rack . the screws come with it . 
spice bottles up to 3.5 oz . sizes up to 4.5 inches tall and 2 inches wide . 
aprox . size is 19 5 8 '' tall , 15 1 4 '' long and 2 1 8 '' deep 
if you are buying them and the ad shows you are buying from a prime seller - you shipment should be free regardless if you are a prime member or not . because orders over $ 25 are shipped free . if you buy from a seller who charges shipping , you would have to work out the details with that seller . 
hello , mounts easily to your cabinet or wall 
i believe it said it should be used within 6 months . but it should remained closed until use . 
i would recommend white . 
i would think that you could . i worked at a dairy queen that made ice cream cakes and we put edible images like these on ice cream cakes all the time and they did fine . make sure the cake is frozen really hard . 
yup 
it depends on the shipping method you use . you can expedite to 2 days or even next day which would be 24 hours . either way your item ships same day if before 3pm mst . thank you ! 
i used a regular size cake pan . 13x9 approximately and it fit w a little room to spare . turned out great . hope that is helpful ! good luck ! 
just message me immediately after purchase with the text you would like written . thank you ! 
they are however there is always the risk of cross contamination . thank you ! 
i ship usually 24 hours as long as i receive your personalization request . the estimated delivery time is usually 3-5 business days using first class shipping 
yes , i do 
it 's probably about 3 1 4 '' x 3 '' . you could definitely cut a sandwich to make it fit ! 
china 
yes 
i would not recommend putting yogurt in one of the bento compartments as it would leak all over . i pack yogurt in a foogo thermos with a u-konserve ice pack and it works well . 
no , it is stainless steel but not durable enough for oven or stove top use . i also do n't put mine in the dishwasher . it is best washed in warm , soapy water . all that said , i really love this product ! it is durable for its intended use , and well worth its cost . 
no 
yes 
i have had mine for many months now and have had no rust problems . i do make sure it is not sitting in water for any period of time however . 
i have an 'easy lunchbox ' tote . the lunchbots container fits in it perfectly . you can definitely fit a regular size water bottle or even a small thermos for drink . we use them daily . 
i use cold packs in the lunch bag with the lunch bot and it stays very cold . my kids have loved them . 
hello and thank you for your question . this was one of our key criteria when we designed our mats . yes our non stick silicone baking mats are dishwasher safe . 
hi edward , thank you for your question . if by overlay you mean to fold them over we would not recommend this since the fiberglass weave ( that helps distribute the heat ) might be damaged . i am curiou what size is your baking mat that you would like to use our baking mats with ? thank you , sam 
i would say yes , but i would recommend you contact the sellar . they are really responsive to questios . 
i do n't know what do you mean by `` mats are cured '' . i have used the largest mat in my baking at 400 degrees and it did n't smoke or melt . hope it helps . 
stainless steel except the stopper for the lid is plastic . 
the lid is stainless ( and can get pretty hot ) , and the seal is plastic 
yes , but no peculiar smell 
i do not remember where it is made . no coatings . nice quality . 
stainless outside , hard plastic inside the cap . 
1103 grams ( 38.9 ounces ) 
this product is made in china and is of high quality . 
i do n't know , but i personally i do not put mine in the dishwasher . i think it looks better to hand wash . 
the top is stainless steel , but the seal is rubber . 
even if only half of the boiling water , its warm-keeping effect as well . we did the test , after 4 hour the temperature to 91 c after 8 hour the temperature to 78 c after 12 hour the temperature to 65 c of course , there may be differences in actual use . 
about 30 lbs . it moves easily . 
it is a little noisy but not loud . 
no , this is a cooler that you add water to and cools by evaporation . your air conditioner takes the water out of the air or dehumidafies the air and they would be working against each other . you would need another air conditioner not a cooler . 
yes , it has a timer . 
holds 63 pints of water 
no , it says in the manual hard water usually is n't a problem . i have well water and it 's not a problem . 
if all you need is a fan , just use a fan instead . 
it take time to do it in regards to cleaning it maybe under 15 minutes total of work aside from cleaning it . i have yet to replace mine but it should take the same amount of time . 
i use mine at night for the cooler air while sleeping . it usually lasts 2 full nights . 
the unit comes fully assembled and ready to use . 
the inside of the pot is ceramic except for the heating element . 
yes and it works great . love it . 
not much , 3-4 cups , tops , probably less than 4 cups , ours had a bad switch so we sent it back . but the company was great about refunds . so we upgraded to a larger teapot . hope that helps . good company ! 
sorry but i do n't have a catalog . royal albert old country rose is what i look for , on amazon or just google it.. 
no it does n't whistle , but it is very quite compared to the other kettles we had . 
yes 
yes , ours was a tight fit too , we actually had to return that teapot as it had a bad switch . but we did like it . regards , 
yes , there is a little plastic piece that tells you where to fill the water to . other than that no other plastic inside kettle . 
the lid is all ceramic . no plastic on the lid . 
i washed mine out with soap and water and then a vinegar soak for about 10mins ( diluted with water ) . no odor and no off taste after doing that . 
the strainer is only used if you want a thicker , `` greek '' style yogurt . you can opt to not use it and just eat the yogurt as is , with the whey . 
i have never tried non-fat dried milk . in recent research on yogurt making i did not come across use of non-fat dried milk as a base or more than an additive to thicken home-made yogurt so i ca n't really say it will work as a stand alone . however , reconstitute and or a mixed base might be worth a try to see to see if it works . use a good starter and proceed as you would normally . if it does not set up in 10 hours , i doubt it will . i personally think yogurt making is fun . i like the fresh taste . i have used whole , 2 % and goat 's milk mixed but i have not had as good a results with goat 's milk as i would like even when mixed with cow 's milk or at least with the brand i can find . it is probably cost saving to make your own although you lose volume when draining yogurt to make greek . without some draining the homemade product is typically a little thinner so i compromise by draining and reincorporating some of the whey back in to desired consistency . i use yogurt for smoothies and as a substitute for buttermilk , which is nice for biscuits and breads . the whey is useful alone and can be added to other dishes as a high protein supplement . i often drink it because it does not upset stomach as milk sometimes does . some people use it on plants . i have n't tried that yet . i believe yogurt making is worthwhile and may be more economical depending on your preferences . some commercial yogurts have additives to thicken them so label reading helps there . i do n't like anything with high fructose syrup . i can add my own choice of fruit , honey , nuts , chia seeds and it tastes very fresh . hope that helps . 
i use an electronic digital one . i heat the milk in the microwave at 1 min intervals . it probably takes about 10 mins . but i have n't actually timed . i decrease the heating time as the temp nears 185 . 
probably about 2 cups . you will have a lot of whey if you strain it for 2 hours . you can always forgo the straining and have about 4 cups of regular yogurt 
it comes with 2 containers- large 7.5 cup and small 6.75 cups . this may be the difference . 
no 
i tried soy milk but it did n't work very well -- yogurt was runny . you need to add some regular milk . 
have n't tried coconut milk yet . i understand that it is hard to get it thick without adding some sort of thickener . i did try goat 's milk and it turned out rather thin . not sure if i did n't let it go long enough or too long . the goat 's milk was also really tart . i 'm like you i would like to try some coconut milk . i make coconut milk kefir a lot . it 's really good . 
how much strained yogurt you actually end up with depends greatly upon the kind of milk you are using and the length of time you strain it . the bonus pack comes with a round `` wheel '' guide for batch yields . it specifies 5 cups milk and 1 2 cup starter with 9 hours incubation time . the yields it lists are : whole milk with 2 hours strain time makes 2-1 2 cups greek yogurt , 2 percent milk with 2 hours straining makes 2-1 4 cups greek yogurt , 1 percent milk with 2 hours straining makes 2 cups greek yogurt , skim milk with 2 hours straining makes 1-3 4 cups greek yogurt . it also has stats for skim plus ( 10 hours ) and soy milk ( 11 hours ) each yielding 2-1 2 cups greek yogurt . longer incubation times cause the yogurt to be more tart and causes greater separation between the yogurt and whey . 
did u bring it down to 100 degrees before adding starter or yogurt as starter then whisk . then put in maker . then strain 
well , i would n't be able to know the degree of difficulty in your situation , but i 'm happy to share my experience in more detail . i found a rhythm by turning the veg and the other end of the veggetti , so each wrist made a quarter twist in the opposite direction . the cutting teeth grab on so that it takes a steady , slight push in while twisting the wrists . one zucchini took me about 12 -15 firm turns . i hope this helps your decision to give it a try . 
i emailed customer service and they said yes it is bpa-free . 
yes , if you cook them too long . my suggestion would be to simply cook the soup w out the zucchini noodles ; then at the very last minute , put them in the soup and simmer for only one minute to warm them . 
no it did n't . but the design allowed me to use my regular dishwashing brush , the type that dispenses soap , cleaning was easy . hope that helps . 
yes , it 's safe in the top rack of the dishwasher . 
i do n't know exact measurements , but i would compare them to spaghetti and linguine noodles . hope that helps . 
yes , it does . have not had any problems with it at all . several friends have also purchased this particular type . 
it does n't indicate so on the item or in the little booklet that came with it . good question.. 
the veggetti includes a plunger gripper turner piece that assists with the wee bits that are left . the gripper is approx two inches or so in diameter and has teeth that grip into the 'stump end ' of the vegetable . i 've had the most success with dense vegetables that have a wide & flat surface that the gripper can 'sink it 's teeth into ' . i do n't use it often , as i like to munch on the end bits or let one of the kids have it as a special treat . 
you can definitely leave the skin on ... comes out fabulous ! 
you definitely should do that if you want your booze to taste like sunscreen . 
yes sir i think that is a possibility , however i would sign up after the cruise . 
they do say it in the fine print on the back but it 's just filler wording to make it look like a real sunscreen bottle . like it says if a security guard is taking the time to read this , you should run lol but it does n't say flask on the front . they 'd open the flask before reading the fine print 
they are made in china out of fda approved food safe plastic 
poured it in . the top has a large hole to pour the booze in . it was easy . i strongly suggest this item ! ! 
you can go up to 100 proof , but , it does have a tendency to to make some feel bullet proof and 10 feet tall . others have a pretty good tolerance for it . i have found , for example , that i tend to become the funniest person i know . so depending on your tolerance , i would recommend small doses to start with to see if you are a fun screener or a `` how did it come to this '' screener . i recommend ingesting small amounts at a time . if your skin is sensitive and your booze is good , i would try my hardest not to spill it on your skin , keeping your sensitive skin safe and your clothing unstained . in extreme cases , you could end up completely exposed to the elements and wondering how you got sunburned `` there '' . use as directed and always remember that you are usually not as funny or bullet proof as you think you are . 
mine did not come with seals . i took a piece of plastic wrap and put it over the threads then screwed the cap on . as for buying seals i really do not know . hope this helps . 
if you are an amazon prime member you will receive them in 2 days or less . even without prime shipping , they should arrive in time with regular shipping . 
they do n't have time to look through everyone 's items , at least on cruises . they look like the real thing so why would they ? 
no flexible plastic 
yes you can 
no , it is just a straight shaft . it would be pretty easy to rig up something i think . 
yes you can use it on candy or maple syrup . basically any liquid or solid that you need to get the temperature of . the temp range is -40 to +450 . i know maple syrup making is quite the detailed process so hopefully someone with experience on that end can weigh in here . we have had plenty of people use the thermometer for candy making and it works perfectly 
auto shuts off in 10 minutes 
total probe length is 4.75 inches . 
sorry , i can not help you , if it is not shown in mfg . details . i gave it as a gift , and can not recall 
as i may have mentioned in the review , in ice slush it measures 32f and is also spot on with the predicted boiling temp at the elevation of abq ( 200f ) but that varies slightly with weather . i 'd guess + - one degree , but have just the one sample and no ast certified thermometers with which to compare . 
do n't see why not . you put it in icewater and calibrate it to 32 degrees f 
no it 's not constructed for oven use . for starters the buttons are rubber . you would have pull your meal oit if the oven to take temp . 
hi lynn , excellent question ! currently our thermometers are sold in retail stores throughout the u.s. , but we do not have a contract with a national chain . we are always looking to get into more retail locations and of course if you know anybody at lowes home depot we would be glad to speak with them : ) 
i personally hand wash it every few times i fill it . i fill it to the line and pump it till the resistance feels tight . it 's easy to use . this is my favorite mister it replaced one by another brand that workers but not as seemlessly . hope this answers you questions . 
i had no problem , it worked fine . 
i have not tried yet , but the instructions say that most of this is dishwasher safe . the two parts that are not look like can easily be soaked in soapy water for cleaning . we have just started using this and really like it . 
good sturdy plastic . very happy with it . 
heavy plastic 
about 6-7oz 
i have n't tried vinegar bases solutions . it might keep the sprayer from clogging though . i have found the sprayer to clog with repeated use of olive oil . 
crystal clear odor resistant bpa free , tritan . it is a copolysester , it is a new plastic or ingredient in the plastic , it is not glass 
probably . ..i have n't tried that . i just use a drug store sprayer for water . of course it wo n't fit in my cabinets and is n't attractive . it lives in the llaundry room . 
pretty positive they are . i 've left mine sitting in the sink for a couple of days in a row with no signs of rust . my old ones would start to rust after just a few hours . 
yes , and very sharp ! 
it does not cut the top off . sharp edge . 
as the opener i received was defective , i can not speak to durability or susceptibility to corrosion . 
box say 's made in china 
it works very easily . i have arthritis in my hands so that was important . the best can opener i have ever had . 
yes 
yes 
yes , it does 
hard plastic . 
i believe it 's actually a queen size as my standard pillowcases are too small for it but my king pillowcases fit it nicely . 
yes . the foam inside is in a non-removable cloth casing . 
throw it in the dryer on low and it will fluff right up . 
it was definitely not poofy - felt like super dense memory foam ... 
31 '' by 17 '' takes a queen size pillow case ! ! 
its got a good amount in it . however it definitely is not shredded foam at all . the cover can be washed . im truthfully not all that happy with this pillow . 
it had a strange chemical like odor the first night i used it . i think it was from the plastic bag that it came in . i washed the pillow and the odor mostly went away . it is gone now a week or so later . 
box 
i 'm not sure , but the product descriptions said a lifetime ... .. however amazon has a 30 day return . my hubby & i love pillows and will use replace them if necessary in several years . they really help and exceed the product descriptions . they are with the money . 
its a combo of hard and fluffy . it reminds me of clay because you can kinda mold it but its fluffy stuff inside . 
on the 18 10 rating the 10 indicates the amount of nickel in the stainless steel and the nickel makes it non magnetic . this is 18 8 so it is a little lower percent nickel but still non magnetic . i hope this helps you . it is a heavy duty baking sheet . 
we bought two lindy 's stainless steel pans each at a different time . the first one we bought is wonderful , heavy stainless steel . unfortunately , the second one we bought because we liked the first one so much is lighter weight and has and inside recessed groove around the perimeter of the inside bottom of the pan ... it is not as nice not as useful because of the ridge . 
it curves back , but flat , not underneath , and water cant get stuck . 
the metal is quite thin . 
the inside dimensions are : 10 1 8 '' wide x 15 '' long . outside dimensions are 12 '' x 16 5 8 '' . it is a heavy , good quality pan . 
it has n't for me . 
no . 
yes , it 's just a slab of stainless steel . 
in india . 
i do n't know others , but i saw an advertisement for this product on dealmoon.com and bought it from the link listed . 
it 's really pretty simple . insert the zucchini into either end of the slicer ( each side makes a different size ) & twist until the entire zucchini has been sliced ( or as much as you want need ) . that 's it ! pastas done ! some people toss it w olive oil & herbs & then give it a little fry in a pan , but you do n't have to , zucchini can be eaten raw & is in fact very delicious that way . 
yes

the $ 100 credit is available to anyone who purchases a nespresso machine $ 199 and above between 11 28 14 - 1 31 2015. see the terms and conditions here : https : www.nespresso.com mobile us en news yep % 202014 % 20vl ... i ordered my nespresso from amazon and received my $ 100 credit by completing this voucher : https : www.nespresso.com promotion us en yeppromo14 : ) 
not for virtuline as the capsules are bar-coded for each different type of coffee and espresso . 
no , i had to buy the drawer seperate , but it is worth buying it . 
large are enough to make about 4-5 of the coffee sized drinks . 
yes . it comes with a year warranty parts and labor . nespresso gives you a loaner machine while yours is being repaired as well . 
no catch , that 's our price , , amazon is known for having good prices , go ahead and purchase , ty 
chrome 
yes 
includes : vertuoline sampler 8 coffee , 4 espresso 
you can customize the machine to make up to a 17 oz . cup of coffee . it 's easy to do . each type of coffee pod has a barcode , so you need to customize once for each blend . after you pop the pod in you just hold down the `` start '' button until you get the amount of coffee you want , then you release the button . the machine will then remember what size cup of coffee you want for that particular blend . ( you are also able to de-program the machine to go back to the original setting if you prefer . ) 
the coffee i get is nice and hot 
no i do n't think ! ! 
first and foremost , you should n't have to microwave coffee to get it hot , it hurts the flavor secondly , it would be a pain to do it every time . it might be hot enough for you , but it was n't for me ! 
i myself have no problem with the coffee temperature . i always warm up the coffee cup with hot water first , dump out the hot water , then make the coffee . easy breezy . 
due the varied array of detergent 's , salt concentration and water types there is the possibility of light spotting on the spoons when run through the dishwasher , therefore we recommend hand washing only . 
no , you can keep the ring on at all times . 
i have put them in the dishwasher several times with no issues . 
i am unsure what grade of stainless steel they are made of , but i like the quality and they seem very durable . 
the measuring spoons are originally made to our specification by a large and very well respected manufacturer in china . we spent many months finding the right supplier for this product and have been delighted with the results . hope this helps . 
yes , the measurements are engraved onto the stainless steel so they will never fade . 
yes , you can remove the ring and hang the spoons on a hook , the hole is 7mm wide and 12mm long 
lifetime guarantee 
yes , they are made of stainless steel and will not corrode . 
they are made of strong , thick stainless steel so will not break if dropped and will last a lifetime . 
yes . but test on inconspicuous spot first to check for color fastness & the like . 
hi , lillian . i have never used the bissell spot cleaner professional portable but i can tell you about a couple of extra features that are on the rug doctor . the rug doctor portable spot cleaner has a telescoping handle as well as the carry handle . it has wheels so you can roll the cleaner to its location . i do n't know about the bissell cleaner , but the rug doctor model also allows you to reach your hand into the dirty water tank to wipe the inside . even with antimicrobial surfaces , all of the cleaners eventually grow bacteria inside of the tank . this feature is excellent . on the downside , the rug doctor portable cleaning solution is not as available in the stores as the bissell solution . however , you can use any of the rug doctor solutions in the portable cleaner . i just use about 1 oz . of cleaner per tank . i hope this info helps you make a decision . so far , i have been happy with my rug doctor . i hope this answer helps you make a more informed decision . good luck ! 
they recommend hot water , however , i have left it in before and it still cleans very well . the water would be cold of course but it is a spot cleaner so there is no way you can use up the tank every time and to me it was a huge waste of money to dump it . good for them though because it would mean selling a ton of cleaning solution . 
15 feet . between the cord and the hose , it gets to the top of my steps . 
it is roughly 5 foot long . 
yes , it does 
yes it appears to be about a 12oz bottle 
i found the rug doctor to have better suction and a better rotating brush . 
it worked really well on my husbands truck carpets and upholstery , he did have major stains , but it looks a whole lot better ! 
no the heads do n't open but all i do is put the head under `` hot water '' , please do n't burn yourself.suck the water up though the nozzle and it will clean out the whole thing and dump into the dirty canister . 
can not speak to cats but is effective on dog hair . just remember this is not intended for carpeting , just bare floors and you 'll be happy . 
qvc carries them . i think the item number would be v31722 . i 'm pretty sure they fit this vacuum , but the filter is washable too . 
yes , although i did not try it until i saw this question . thanks . 
replacement filters are available on amazon 
no they do not . 
this thing is not good for much of anything but cleaning a keyboard , or venetian blinds . its not powerful at all , but it sure is noisy . i recommend putting your money into something better , because even if you bought something twice the cost , it would be cheaper in the long run because you 'd get something that actually vacuumed . 
i bought the insurance , it was cheap , maybe you could buy it now . 
no 
no 
no i do n't think so 
hello ret - it is manufactured in china . hope that helps . mike . 
overall pan is 20 1 4 `` x 14 `` . inside is 18 '' x 13 '' . grill sits inside pan . 
yes 
i am not sure why but it appears that the cooling rack can be used up to 350 degrees . as to the broiler , perhaps it is because of the aluminum . i have not used this one under the broiler not even my neighbor . if it requires 450 what are you making , i will suggest using another pan such as farberware or good cook which are inexpensive and work fine even under the broiler . 
helli linda - bakeware is safe up to 450 degrees . do not use under the broiler . cooling rack is safe to 350 degrees . do not use under the broiler . hope that helps . mike . 
hello deborah - that should not be a problem . beat wishes -mike 
i 'm very satisfied with the fan . it 's relatively quiet , good air flow and looks nice . it should do fine in a room of that size . you may have to run on the higher speed . 
i did have a funny odor ... something like oil or plastic when i first got this fan . the smell is gone now ... took about a week of use to subside . the longer you leave it on the faster it will dissipate . i only used it at night , and then only on occasion because it is still so cold in ny ... ..keep running it and it will go away soon ! ! ! 
no . 
it is not silent but it is the quietest fan i have ever owned . 
no heat but shows temp 
yes 
13 inches 
it does n't say anywhere on the box , fan or manual . it does have the company address located in phoenix , az 
the only difference between these is oem distributor . this product is warranted by ming 's mark inc. dba gowise usa ; another one is maintained by ozeri . +++ i just figure out the original chinese manufacturer is natridy electric appliance ind.co. , ltd . if you 'd like to compare the specifications , `` natridy and nd-668r-35 '' are good keywords for your web-search . 
it 's tough going for the first few grinds . the burrs are new and they need to be worked a few times . things will loosen up as the oils from the beans lubricant the burrs . your grind texture and color of the beans are also a factor in how smooth the mechanism works when the grinder is new . light beans are harder , dark are more oily and softer . try using a courser grind for a bit till the burrs are broke in . you can always regrind the course ground you just did . once the grinder is broken in you should find grinding is a breeze . i myself use a courser grind to get more coffee flavor . finer grind dose n't work well in drip pots unless they are presses or preculators . do n't give up on your little grinder . there 's nothing more tastier and aromatic than fresh ground coffee . i feel sure once you get your grinder broke in you 'll really like it . sincerely , lynn 
put what you are grinding in the top and turn clockwise slowly to grind . it will take a little time to grind say 12 cups worth of coffee . to adjust grind corpse ness or fineness remove nut , leaver and locking device . turn star nut counterclockwise for a corser grind and clockwise for a finer grind . reinstall locking device , leaver and nut and you are ready to grind . i used this grinder camping and it did a lovely job for us . 
good question ! there are no markings on the product or the user leaflet that comes with it to indicate where it is made . i have tried to trace the manufacturer via the asin but that led to a dead end . i did find this on faceblook : `` tanors is a german firm devoted to producing creative and innovative kitchen and bar products . '' it may be produced in china for this german firm and imported to the usa from germany . welcome to the global village marketplace ... 
it takes me maybe three minutes to obtain enough for a 32-ounce press . i tend to grind fairly slowly as i feel it works more smoothly that way . 
not yet , , i purchased for a home in mexico where there are frequent power outages , , so i figured at least this way i could always have my coffee , , takes a few more minutes to grind , but since i use a french press i have to wait for the water to boil anyways , , gets a little blood flowing , ,i like it ! 
i do love this product , and bought it to set to a press pot grind . my kyocera is set to drip . this works as well as its more expensive predecessor , but is not quite as solidly built . i have n't seen any rust yet and have had ours for a years . since we use it often , i do n't pay much attention to washing the top mechanism , so it has not been watered either . i suggest finding a nut for the top , 6mm - 1.00 ( i think , but take the top nut with you just in case ) . this upgrade works with the kyocera too . i turn it with a small variable speed cordless drill ... thanks dewalt . my hands are wreckage , and i set mine up like this so my spouse would n't have to do the daily grind . 
the cup holds about a cup of grounds . the size is probably in centimeters . assembled size is 7.5 inches high . crank is 5 inches so you will need 10 inches clearance to use . 
yes . and a cover to the grinder jar is also included . the grinder jar and cover can be used to store ground coffee in the refrigerator , 
yes , the beans and grinds have contact with plastic 
this manual grinder sounds nothing like an electric grinder . it does make noise , and it does take longer to manually grind , but if you are down the hall in the kitchen , and the bedroom doors are closed , there should be no problem . the noise is about like taking a handful of gravel and swirling them around in your hands at a moderate pace . it takes me about 45 seconds to grind for a french press . it is part of the fun ritual of making coffee in the morning . 
brown 
the side with the square boxes is the side that should be face down it might take a few days for it to settle maybe ? . i 've had mine in the kitchen for the better part of 2014 and its been a big help on my feet when cooking and cleaning dishes and stuff . 
it is lightly textured 
i have had high heels on this mat a couple times , but not often . also the heels i had may not be quite as small as some stilettos i 've seen . that said , they will leave an impression on the mat for a while , but then it springs back . have tried not to have them on there for long . 
hi there ! thanks for the question - this mat is just shy of 3 4 '' thick . i hope that helps and thank you very much for checking us out ! ! 
wipes clean . 
36 '' x 20 '' i use it in front of the sink , but have a movable island and it gets used when i move the island to the sink in an `` l '' shape and it is a `` two-fer '' . 
hi philip - i am sorry that our customer service representative was unsure where , exactly , this mat was manufactured . this version is made in china currently . we are working with a us supplier for new mats launching soon ( stay tuned ) , but these are imported . i hope that helps ! chris k 
hi joan . this mat is imported from china . there are always plenty of stock , so feel free to order 25 at a time . if you are doing bulk orders feel free to contact us through our amazon web store . 
one cat , or two kittens ! 
the 450 is the latest unit and it is easier to clean and also vacuums when cleaning . by what i have read about the 390 they have issues with leaving water and cleaning them out . the 450 so far has been brilliant . it cleans the floor so well it shines . so far i am very impressed with 450. hope it helps . 
the ones from my 800 series did not work , but they are lighthouses that you can set as virtual walls . 
it will handle the floor as long as the height difference is n't more than 4-5mm . more than that and the squeegee wo n't suck up the water . as far as dog hair goes i have 2 dogs and the scooba does n't seem to have a problem with there hair . we also run our roomba everyday which helps with the hair . 
hello , if you request it , we can supply the worldwide 100-240v power supply . 
if you run it regularly , the scoobs does a fair job of `` sweeping . '' but , cleaning it becomes messier as the amount of dirt it picks up increases . i run my roomba vacuum before running the scooba . 
it does , but you need to supply your own two pin kettle lead . 
hello- yes 1 year parts & labor warranty . 
the scooba will break if you use anything but water , water vinegar solution , or the stuff that they make you buy just for scooba . i have been through 3 scoobas and it turns out that they have a sensor inside ( customer service told me ) that will be destroyed degraded if the solution is n't one of the above . in fact , i thought that i could at least suck up whatever i put down , including diluted mr. clean . nope . it broke on that ... technically i was not breaking the `` rules '' not to use someone elses ' cleaner , but it broke it . the vinegar water solution does an excellent job , stick with that and you 'll do fine . 
it is not possible to have a dock with something that uses liquids and would still be wet when returning to a dock without the possibility of shorting out the electrical and setting the house on fire . 
as you can see , it 's somewhat shaped like a tulip . it measures approximately 1 inch at the very bottom with a lip that allows it to stand on its own on the counter . it flairs out and i measured it at 3.5 inches across the top . when it 's in the water , it floats well above the very top of the poacher , so that allows you enough room to grab two tips to remove when your egg is done . i love mine ! 
not sure about putting them in a toaster oven - a regular maybe . i would contact the manufacturer first . 
all you need it a big spoon . i use a slotted cooking spoon , but any kind of big spoon to get under the pod is all you need . it 's very easy once the egg is cooked , it 's not going to slide out . 
you do n't need a special pan . i just use a sauce pan ... 
yes , just be sure to keep them from tipping over while filling and add maybe a minute to your cook time . 
i do n't do eggs in the microwave because of several bad experiences . but these little guys work great in a covered pan of water on the stovetop ... 
i just use a soapy sponge and rinse it well . i used it last night . i rub the inside with some soft butter , put the eggs in , then float into a pot of simmering water and put the lid on . they came out perfect ! ! ! 
this poacher sits in boiling water on the stove ... i 'm not sure about using it in the microwave . cuisinart has a great hard boiled egg maker ... i have one and it 's awesome , quick and easy ! 
nothing on the product itself , and i no longer have the packaging . sorry . 
i have n't tried microwaving but these work very well in a covered pan of slow boiling water . spray them inside with a non stick spay and let cook 5 minutes . 
hi , my name is austin . i 'm the product manager for hand vacs at black+decker . a simple `` better '' between all these lithium hand vacs is a tough answer but i 'll do my best . the pivot ( bdh2000pl ) has the strongest suction and packs down the smallest for storage . if you 're just looking for huge power in a convenient storage size this is the one you want . the flex with floor head ( bdh2020flfh and bdh1620flfh ) are the most versatile and have the longest run time . the 4 foot hose , accessories , and floor head make these perfect for floor to ceiling cleaning , picking up messes under the table , cleaning stairs , detail cleaning the car , etc . the pet hair attachment on the 20v , and soon to be available separately ( bdh200fvph ) , works great for pet hair as well as carpeted stairs , car upholstery etc . the more traditional hand vacs ( bdh2000l , chv1410l ) have the longest crevice tools and largest capacity . the extra reach is great for getting cobwebs , bugs , and under and between appliances . all of these units have the strong suction and fade free power that comes with lithium ion battery technology.. 
not that i know of but black+decker has a video at their website about the product it does show you how it is used . it 's pretty straight forward . easy to figure out . 
l:5 1 4 '' h:3.5 '' w:5 '' the charging base is mountable . 
black and decker manuals are available at http : blackanddecker.com manuals.aspx . 
hi jeff , my name is austin . i 'm the vacuum product manager here at black+decker . unfortunately , the hose attachments from the 12v pivot auto vac ( pav1200 ) are n't available separately . this unit is however cordless and much more powerful than the pivot auto vac . if you 're looking for a powerful lithium vac with the versatility of the hose & brushes from the pivot auto vac , i would try looking at the 16 or 20v max lithium flex vacs , ( bdh1620flfh , bdh2020flfh ) . they have the same advantages of the lithium battery , a 4 foot hose plus multiple attachments , and a great stick vac head for use in the house . they 're my favorite vacs for cleaning the car and i 've tried a few . they have a little less suction power than the bdh2000pl but longer run time for bigger jobs . 
if it is completely charged 15 minutes the most . 
120-240v~50 60hz 0.3a output 23v dc 
apparently the power supply has been changed ( downgraded actually ) , my one is black & decker class 2 power supply p n : 90602523-01 model no : s0100u2300040 input : 120v ~ 60hz 0.3a output : 23v dc 400ma it 's really disappointed me as i am in china and i need 220v ! i checked the comment and question answers before i purchased it , now it has been downgraded . : - ( 
hi paula , my name is austin . i 'm the vacuum product manager here at black+decker . the folded length is 10 inches . with the nozzle pivoted open it 's 16 inches . with the crevice tool extended it gets up to 19 inches . 
yes it can be . however you would need an adapter for the plug . input is 120-240,50 60hz , .3a 
width : 10 inches depth : 7 inches height : 4.3 inches 
yes it comes completely assembled . 
the shelves are each 2 inches deep . votive candles will fit if they are in small votive holders , but not if they are large decor holders . if they are in the small plastic cups that a certain name brand or two are sold in , they will absolutely fit . david a , who answered on november 28 is absolutely correct , though . hey must be in or on a non-conducting holder or they may melt the plastic shelf itself . 
you could probably place 2 shoes on each shelf without the display looking cluttered . you may get 3 on each shelf if you angle them a bit . 
6 of the approx . 2 oz.plastic jars 
yes i think it would be . i had to look up what amibo was first , but it is definately a good size 
i think this would work well . i 'm very happy with these tiered shelves . they are sturdy and compact and do n't take up too much space . i use them for spices , but essential oils would work . each shelf holds 5 regular sized spice bottles , just to give you an idea size wise . 
it fit in mine . i looked everywhere for one that would fit and this was the only one that i found because the depth of my cabinets were so short . i ordered two of them - great quality and price ! 
the depth is 2 inches . perfect for mccormick-type spice bottles . and the tiers allow for easy reading of the labels so you can tell what the spice are on each tier . 
it is 10 inches across . 
it is very comfortable however it may not be firm enough for your liking . i would agree with the others who say it is `` medium to soft . '' if you can check one out in a store first , you could `` con-firm '' if it is firm enough for your liking : - ) 
yes it is , i personally have n't slept on it , but my son says it is super comfortable and he is very happy with it . 
a straight memory foam mattress would still probably have this issue . this particular mattress does have a pillow top , so that helps somewhat , but i do still get pretty warm on it . 
not sure , my box was 60 '' long . might want to ask the company before unpacking ( would be really hard to pack up to ship back ) . 877-955-5503 is their customer service number . 
when i ordered it they sent me tracking numbers , ups . delivered so i could see from the tracking numbers when it would arrive 
no , once it is expanded , it is just like a regular mattress . such a comfortable bed ; - ) 
i would think so ... its very comfortable and i do belive it will be fine on your box spring . 
no 
it does n't . holds its shape ! 
my husband is 6'1 and weighs 285 ? or more and no problem with that . very comfy and a great deal

china . 
they work great for flour , sugar , baking powder ( dry ingredients . ) 
yes , the pressed lettering can be seen inside , just backwards with a line at appropriate level . 
they are 18 8 stainless . 
there is no 1 8 cup marked on these cups but thank you for bringing it to our attention . we hope to include an 1 8 cup measure in the next batch we manufacture . i will let you know when these are available . kitchen made customer support 
i found them to be accurate . keep in mind that all measuring products are never exact . however , my husband uses the metric system and he determined these were as accurate as any others we have . 
no , they stay upright . 
no 
no . our only concern about the handles is that they are quite short . other than that , they are fine . 
these measuring cups work for wet and dry because there are so many measuring cup sizes you can just pour the liquid into the proper size . 
i 'm not sure . we have the keurig platinum i believe and it works perfectly . 
it 's open 
it works in any keurig that takes kcups 
yes 
i am sorry but i do not know but it fits my model just fine . 
yes mine did . mine works perfectly . 
i 'm not positive but it does look like it would i have the 65 
yes 
no , i lost the original during transport . 
yes it does 
it is really a j. when you see the mold in person you can see the difference better . 
yes , it is food grade . please be note , the finished size is about 1cm ( 0.39 inches ) . they are small size . sincerely , seller : allforhome 
hello , the finished fondant letters are small size , about 1cm ( 0.4 inches ) . sincerely , seller : allforhome 
hello ralch , the finished letters are small size , about 1cm ( 0.4 inches ) , sincerely , seller : allforhome 
i bought this for making soap as well . i believe it would have to be a very small batch of soap . the sides are straight . i have not used mine for making soap because i think it 's too small . i am still using a loaf pan lined with plastic . i was disappointed when i received this item . 
3 1 2 '' x 5 3 8 '' x 1 3 4 '' 
yes , the inside bottom is flat and smooth . the top is wider than bottom , the green one in the picture is example of finished item , you can see directly from the picture . sincerely , seller : allforhome 
hi there , the finished soap about 400 g. sincerely , seller : allforhome 
yes , ours is pink . 
the manual says 110v . it 's a regular grounded 3 prong plug . 
i think with a job of that size you 'd be better off to get a larger , more professional machine , even if you have to rent one . 
this is not an extractor 
i use it with regular wall outlets . no issues . it 's a small appliance . 
i use mine with an extension cord most of the times with no problen . 
happened to me too ... i contacted the seller and they told me that it usually shuts down if it over-heats and should work after some time ... but that never happened to mine so i returned it and got a refund ... 
i do use it on mine , it helps with hard to reach areas and loosens and cleans , it wo n't do it all , of course , you still need to wipe with a clean rag , on hard areas i always dry clean with a soft brush and rubbing alcohol first , then continue on with the steam , be sure the fabric you are using it on will withstand water or steam though . works good for the mats and rugs , still have to wipe and brush of course , but makes the job so much easier and looks so much more finished in the corners and cracks where you ca n't reach . i really like my steamer , use it on most everything , saves my fingers and hands with arthritis . i have a bigger machine also , but i grab this one evrytime unless it 's for a floor . 
as long as you have carpet cleaner you will be pleased . 
yes . it still works the same . 
i dont wee why not it has different attachments it works great on the cook stove 
yes , it does a great job on my travertine as well as the hard wood . it also does a nice job on area rugs and carpet . 
hello , this is the information i received from my sales rep today . the unit will go back and recharge , and will start from the beginning , it will not restart where it finished off , will begin again complete room have a nice day and wonderful holiday season 
any long hair gets entangled in the center brush , but it is relatively easy to clean by removing the brush . but this is the same with a canister vacuum . 
i have n't noticed any issues with this . i am able to sit in the same room while it is running ( it 's so quiet , i have to check sometimes to see if it is still running ! ) without aggravating my asthma . it does a great job of picking everything from dust to the dirt the dog dragged in to animal hair . 
no hepa , it has and airclean filter ( replace every three months ) . it does come with a remote . you set your modes , the clock , or tell the scout to return to the charging base from here . this also gives you the ability to set a timer for the scout and switch to some of the scout 's other cleaning modes , corner , spot and turbo . 
my rug has 1 inch fringe and it does not . 
hi shotan . it will absolutely work on a floor with multiple rooms . if you are going to purchase miele 's rx1 scout , remeber to purchase from pal 's discount vac and sew through amazon . kind regards . 
not at all . works as advertised . 
i am not sure . i only tried the ones that came with the rx1 . 
the idea is that you use one battery while the other is charging . then , when your in use battery runs out ( or low ) - swap the batteries . it takes about 3 seconds . having two chargers would be silly . 
brush has it 's own power button so you can choose on or off . it also shuts off automatically when stowed in upright position . wheels are a hard plastic with rubber on outside . 
great question . however , since you watched the video , you probably already know to contact hoover directly or `` hit ( them ) up on facebook '' for any questions regarding the box .i bought this vacuum a few months ago , really an awesome box . 
each lithiumlife battery will power the vacuum for up to 25 minutes . it comes with two , for a total of 50 minutes . how long is that ? http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=yls4ic52snk 
i have owned the hoover linx and it is a wonderful cordless vac but not in the same class as the hoover air . the hoover air does everything a normal full size vac would do , just without the cord . the hoover air comes with cleaning attachments that you do not get with the hoover linx . the hoover air has a 20 volt battery and you will only get an 18 volt with the hoover linx . also , you will get two batteries with the hoover air and only one with the hoover linx . having two batteries makes it possible for me to be able to vacuum my entire house without waiting for a battery to recharge . if you want a cordless vac for small jobs then the hoover linx is fantastic , if you want a vacuum you can do everything with then i highly recommend the hoover air . 
i have a chow shepherd mix and i swear he sheds enough to make a sweater a day . i have had no issue getting his hair off both hard flooring and thick pile carpet . 
we have thick carpet but not long strand it works well but not as well as regular vac 
it does lay flat , but it needs about nine inches to go all the way under , because of the battery on the front . 
3 hours or less . 
it works on my two bedrooms with carpet but mainly i use it on hardwood and tile floors , , , it has a selection that activates a curled brush roller that seems to work on carpet ok 
disappointingly this machine does not clean grout . the mcculloch mc-1275 heavy-duty steam cleaner , also available on amazon , does a great job . 
there is a booklet in the box- not in depth for sure- it can be used on sealed hardwood floors- this machine is hotter than my previous haan- i would exercise caution 
they sent me a `` refurbished '' machine originally , when i complained they sent a second one . the trigger for the steam blast broke on the first use , so now it super steams all the time . they both still work after a few weeks , but they are cheap-ish and your expectations should be low-ish . ok , i guess . 
yes , i use it on my pergo laminate floors and it works great 
i apologize i have no idea - it has 3 prongs on the plug 
yes . the steam dries very quickly and it does beautifully on my laminate floors . 
yes , they have 2 wide strips of velcro on the pads . i have not had any problems with them moving around while using it . 
i bought this for my daughter in-law - wood floors through out the house , she tells me she loves it , i have the older model and love it as well . 
we have not attempted to use the unit on carpet of any kind . we bought it for cleaning tile floors and ca n't say that we have been impressed with the results . the white grout still looks dark gray . so it is in a closet for lack of a better use . 
i 've not tried it on granite , but since it wo n't sit in one spot producing steam . ( handle upright position great design ) i would try it as and use it like a mop , the steam it produces heats to 213 degrees . it works great . use distilled water . 
i 've always vacuumed first . i did n't want to push more dirt into the carpet . 
yes , here is the link . http : www.amazon.com rug-doctor-universal-hand-tool dp b009b496lu ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1400411947 & sr=8-1 & keywords=rug+doctor+universal+hand+tool 
it is about 35 pound empty . when you fill it , it is closer to 50 pounds . 
it does not heat the solution . you need to use hot water when mixing the solution . 
i do n't believe so . i just pour in hot tap water . there is no indicator light or evidence of heating element 
they are made with a type of plastic that is called tritan which is 100 % shatterproof and bpa free . 
they are 4.25 '' tall . 
these are great ! no plastic smell or taste and double walked so they keep the white wine cold . 
these are clear plastic . seriously great `` glasses '' ... highly recommend them . 
the packaging says `` up to 17oz '' 
the rim is rounded . the glass has a nice feel in your hand . we have gotten compliments on them . they also clean up great in the top rack of the dishwasher . pretty good product for the money . 
i would not even try to put biking water in these as they are wine glasses . they are good quality plastic wine glasses . no where does it say they are insulated . 
17 
yes they are a bit better because they really can be washed in the upper rack of the dishwasher without warping - the govino warps on the upper rack . 
they are 1 16 '' thick . 
looking at the front of the unit , it 's on the left side . 
it comes with a little insulation foam . not sure if you can call them weather stripping per say 
from the back of the unit to the accordion extensions on either side is about 10.5 '' . add another inch for the accordion and i 'd estimate between 11 and 12 '' sticking out from the inside front of the window to the very back of the unit . 
6.2 amps 
the unit has accordion pieces that seal against the window frame . they can expand out for a much wider window , or compress to 23 '' . 
if the unit has been tipped sideways during transit or installation , it is good practice to let it sit in the correct horizontal position for several hours to allow the refrigerant to settle . 
since a window is hole in a wall , why not ? 
not great but not the worst i 've experienced either . as some others have said it seems to gurgle loudly at first and then settles down . but it 's definitely not quiet even after it gets done with the gurgling . 
most of the install kit . you might need few more items depending on your window size and your choice . 
i have an 8,000 btu ffre0833q1 a c unit . from inside contact point to the outside end is 11 inches . 
use the special handle cover to protect your fingers at the end of the vegetable and minimize waste 
there are two blades inside the spiral slicer ( no need to change blades ) , so you can enjoy thinner or thicker veggie spirals to your liking 
funny you should ask that , i was going to ask the same question as i did n't get the ebook either . after i posted this answer , i contacted the seller and received the book by e-mail this morning , the 8th . 
you can make long and short spiral strips . it 's easier to get spirals out of the zucchinis while the carrots spiral is a bit harder because it 's a much firmer vegetable 
yes , that 's what i have . fits perfectly ! 
yes , it seems to 
sorry no 
yes this will fit the bigger nutri bullet not the smaller magic bullet blender . 
i do n't know . i bought these for my bullet ( not sure of the model ) and they are a misfit . 
no 
no these gasket will not fit any nutri bullet rx model . 
it fits the `` nutribullet '' not nutribullet rx . i am not familiar with 600 series . i only know the units as tribullet . 
there was n't on the ones i purchased . 
i have a nutribullet . not sure if it is the rx or not . got it one year ago . these fit great . have only used one but have a spare now . 
what 's missing flour ? anything else ? 
the box reads , `` do not cut on the mat '' . 
totally smooth . i keep it rolled up in the box it came in and when it is time to use on the counter , it unrolls and lies flat . no creases and no raised lines on the surface at all , including where the measuring circles are . 
about 14 x 22 inches ; large enough to make a large pizza on . 
i too have tile countertops but i bought a large nylon cutting board and use the mat on it instead of the countertop . the mat is thin and will not bridge the grout lines . 
the pain will not come off or stick to the dough . we stand by our product and if for any reason our sili bake mat is not for you , please email our top-notch customer service for full refund , no questions asked . 
picture a sheet of construction paper covered with the silicone . it 's thin but does the job very nicely . 
it did come in a small plastic tube bag . seemed like it would be a nightmare to put it back in there every time and i use mine frequently enough though that i just tossed it . for storage i just put it back in the box . the box says `` designed in california . made in china . '' seller designer seems pretty communicative so i am sure if there are any questions they will jump in . 
no 
you can safely purchase the mat and if for any reason it is not for you , please email our top-notch customer service for full refund , no questions asked . cheers ~ sili bake 
5 amps per frigidaire and 550 watts if power factor is 1.0 and voltage is 110 volts . rule of thumb ( ? ) is peak start-up current for fan and compressor will be 10 to 13 amps . should work well with 15 or 20 amp circuit breakers , provided you know the amps of other appliances in same circuit . 
if you are facing the unit , the power cord comes out from under the ac on your left . 
60 lbs is the item weight . shipping weight is 69 
11.2 
there are `` side panels '' that take up a minimum amount of space as well . it 's possible if you do n't install the `` wings '' on the ac unit , but it 'd be tight and worse , you might have no way to fill the space on both sides of the unit if it 's installed without the expandable side spacers . you 'd have to fill in around the opening with other materials , which could be problematic . 
yes , if you hit the sensor button on the remote , the ac will use that sensor 's temp to determine when to cut on and off . 
it does bring air from outside , but only via the fan . the hot air from inside is vented out when the a c is on . it does not have a separate vent ! some a c 's have a vent which allows it exchange outside air like opening the window . i live in seattle and it gets cool at night and i 'd rather open the window to get fresh air but i have to turn on the noisy fan only mode in the a c to get outside air . i hope that helps . 
noise intensity is about as loud as fan at high . noise the ac generates is not an issue for me . cools well enough for a small to mid room . 
yes ... have never checked to see if it 's adjustable ... 
it extends about 5 - 10 inches . i ca n't get outside to measure it , but that would be my best guess . 
if you look at the other model , the fra052xt7 , here on amazon and scroll down that page , you will find a really nice comparison chart that shows the specifics and details on these two models as well as the five `` mini-compact '' models frigidaire offers . yes , this one does appear to be more energy efficient and other differences are noted there on that product information chart . 
hello.. here are all of the electrical specs provided by the manufacturer of this unit electrical volts : 115 volts amps ( cool ) : 4.8 amps watts ( cool ) : 515 watts length of power cord ( min . max . ) : 6 ft. 6.5 ft. plug type ( nema ) : lcdi ( 5-15p ) we hope this helps 
for extra protection the support bar is good but it is not required for install . some buildings however require you to have it so it 's always good to check 
the height may be an issue . you can purchase plexi glass to fill the top space 
yes . manufacturer 1 year parts and labor and 5 years on compressor 
yes.. this unit can be plugged into a standard socket . we do suggest , however that no other appliance is plugged into the same circuit to avoid overload 
hello.. the window maximum should be 23 since the size of the actual unit is 16 '' . meaning it comes with expanders . @ @ '' wide window is a typical window and this will fit like a glove . happy shopping 
energy efficiency ratio is 9.7 
easy to install so it must be easy to remove . i 'm an 83 year old woman and with another old lady we were able to lift it into a window . use the foam included for filling the spaces and we were good to go . nice little unit . 
3 feet . you can do a search for heavy duty extension cord on amazon 
from the frigidaire.com website you can compare the 2. it says the newer model will cool a 250 sq ft room compared to 216 ; energy efficiency ratio is 11.2 10.7 ; amps are 4.7 5.2 ; otherwise , they 're the same 
i measured it just now- it sticks out eleven inches from the window . 
open the front of the a c unit on the side facing the room and remove the filter by hand and clean it well with a dry paint brush to remove any pollen lent etc. , i take it outside to do this ... or you can wash it under running cold water if it really needs that much cleaning , but blow it dry with a hair dryer or similar before replacing it . then if the light is still on afterward , press the filter button and it goes off . this light comes on after the air conditioner has operated , i believe the directions said around 1000 hrs. , so it 's automatic , even if you have already cleaned it prior . hope this helps you . 
yes , it should n't be a problem to use this unit in a window that 's 24.25 wide , that 's a side to side opening . i just measured mine , the actually unit is only 23 1 4 inches wide total on the inside and even less on the outside , that is without the side panels . if your window opening is 24.25 , it would be a tight fit , which sounds almost ideal to me . 
no , it does not . the inside air handler is a closed system , and does not have any vents that open to outside air . only larger units would have this option , and unfortunately , even those are usually too small to be effective . best option is to open a window elsewhere and put a fan in it to bring in outside air . 
your 27 in window would work no problem . 
it only has a plastic air filter that is `` ionized '' ( think static electricity ) to attract remove particulates from the air . neither unit really `` purifies '' the air . 
yes and that feature is fantastic . so i set it for 72 while we sleep and move it to 75 during the day . 
i just measured and the unit is actually more than one height , depending on where you measure . the portion that sticks outside the window is 12 inches high . the portion that 's inside , is higher at the back ( where the outside portion and inside portion meet ) and the front is not as high , tapering , if you will . so , the part at the back is 9 3 4 inches high and it narrows to 7 1 2 inches at the very front of the unit . if you picture a trapezoid on it 's side , that might help . by the way , i love mine . 
honestly i bought if for my bedroom so i needed the silence ... and i am extremely happy with this unit ... not only is it nice looking in the window and so slim that you actually almost miss seeing it and as far as it being silent ... .highly recommend this unit ... very quiet and perfect for the bedroom ... 
product weight ( lbs ) : 46 
as an air conditioner , it dehumidifies and water pools in the bottom to drain out . as a separate dehumidifier ? no . 
as long as the ac can fit in the opening and the back can extend far enough out to drain away from the house , i do n't see why not . you just may have to shim it somehow to get a tight fit all the way around and make sure nothing obscures the air flow . 
15 1 2 from front to back . 11 1 2 from the back of the window support to the back 
per the energy guide sticker on the amazon page it is 9.8 
i believe that your window will be too small for this unit . 
unfortunately this is not a energy star a c . 
the built in timer allows you to preset the unit to turn on and off in half hour increments . 
yes , it does . 110 , 120 , 115 , are all interchangeable . 
normal or alittle more quiet 
this is the link to the sleeve i purchased for the air conditioner and it fits perfectly . http : www.amazon.com dp b000ud0kti ? tag=mh0b-20 & hvadid=4962567038 & ref=pd_sl_9sgg68rd3l_p 
yes it includes a remote that shows the room temp on it . 
we got the ffta0833q1 a c unit with product dimensions 20.5 '' d x 24 '' w x 14.5 '' h , and it 's a close fit in the sleeve to within a bit less than an inch on the sides and a fraction of an inch on top & bottom , using the frigidaire a c wall sleeve kit ea108t with product dimensions 17.5 '' d x 25.5 '' w x 15.2 '' h. that 's depth x width x height . a deeper a c unit could fit into a wall sleeve than the sleeve 's depth measurement , but you can hardly fit a wider or taller unit into a sleeve . i do n't think a 24-inch wide sleeve ( like the kenmore sleeve you 've got ) will easily hold the 24-inch wide frigidaire a c unit . it would sure be a tight shove to get them together . screeeeech . we have neighbors who installed a larger wall a c ( 18,000 btu ) without a sleeve and it works fine without one , so that 's another option if you do n't want to purchase a new sleeve . we just preferred being able to easily pull the a c unit out of the wall if it needed to be replaced or repaired , so got the sleeve . 
yes . it is a bit annoying . 
it is only the ac . i did not buy the sleeve and i installed it directly to the hole in the wall and it is working fine 
just the back 
7.8 amps 
it hums like any air conditioner but is n't overly loud . i can hardly hear it when in the next room 
yes absolutely . you can purchase 5 units from us . 
normally it will . once mine did not and i never understood why . 
25.4 '' is listed as the width . 
these ffr models are designed to be used through a window however frigidaire does make through-wall models ( fft models ) which can be ordered with an optional wall sleeve . 
eer 
the eer seems to be the whole difference , the whole point of a new model . 
regular outlet is fine . 
yes . it has a slide out chassis . 
yes . 110v . it comes with a `` window mounting kit '' that is designed to support this unit in a window . please note , that is weighs about 100 lbs . 
this air conditioner is relatively lite at around 42 pounds , now ! the one thing you absolutely will want to do is to make sure you support the top rail of the unit with 3 screws that screw into your window and also , make 100 % sure that you secure the unit with the window locks provided with the unit , otherwise someone could slide the accordian flaps aside , and possibly remove your unit from your window . rebecca , i 'm pretty much blind except i can see a little light , and i pretty much had it installed in about 10 15 minutes . just take your time , and read your instructions for the install , and you should be fine , also the unit does n't stick out of the window that muchso you should n't need an extra support , however , if your window cill is in a newer home , there is that possibility that you may need a bracket to support it from the outside , , first though , see if the unit fits into the track of your window , and then , slide your window down over top of the unit and proceed to screw the top rail to the window that you just slid down . the first thing you will want to do as you unbox your unit is to assemble the top rail with the 4 screws provided to your air conditioner ok ? i hope my info helped you in your decision , and , if i can be of any more assistance , by all means , please feel free to write me at : raydeman @ comcast.net . thank you rebecca , and i hope you have a good summer .

this unit is energy star certified , whereas the earlier one was n't . the epa has set limits on the amount of energy required to create 1 btu of cooling . this unit meets those limits , the earlier one apparently did n't 
very quiet . the quietest ac i 've owned 
you can install the unit , it will fit in 16 '' , but the side panels wo n't . but with a slider you can slide the window up against it . but it 's made for a double hung window and needs a sash to come down on top of it to hold it in place . you could devise some way of putting a bar across the top anchored to the sliding sash and jamb . it 's a neat little unit . 
that 's a small window ! you may need to have a board cut to fit any gap which results . one very important thing : the filter slides out the side , so do n't install it right up the a window frame close to the right . it has the be in the middle of the window area . mine is installed in a regular apartment size window ... and it was a real hassle . i also have no way to clean the filter easily . works fine though , although it 's a bit noisy . 
hello kelphy , this unit will only fit a 13 '' windows in height . thank you . 
not without taking the unit apart and voiding the warranty . 
i think it can be mounted on the floor but obviously the back side must be blowing air outside the rv . if the entire unit is inside then it will not work . 
4 inchs 
yes . ea108t is the recommended sleeve for that model . 
yes , you do need a sleeve or a hole cut through the wall . it is not for window installation . 
yes just hit the fan button and fan will come on without compressor 
yes it is , although the frigidaire is 20 1 2 '' deep so it will stick out an additional 3 4 '' . 
depth : 20-1 2 '' height : 14-1 2 '' width : 24 '' 
please refer to page 12 of the owner 's guide . http : manuals.frigidaire.com prodinfo_pdf edison 2020213a1627en.pdf 
the unit is sold without the sleeve ( sleeve sold separately ) with exterior dimensions of : depth : 20-1 2 '' height : 14-1 2 '' width : 24 '' . this model should slide right into an existing sleeve that meet the above dimensions . i 'm not clear on what you mean by `` casing over the innards '' . please refer to page 1 of the installation guide . http : manuals.frigidaire.com prodinfo_pdf edison 2020213a1639.pdf 
it is not necessary . it will fit most existing wall sleeves and includes a standard universal interior trim kit to conceal any gaps . new wall sleeves are sold separately . just make sure that the existing sleeve is close to the dimensions of the new a c chassis . 
well , i tried my remote about three feet below , unit is about four feet from the floor and the unit responded . not a `` scientific '' test , but the unit also responds about a distance of fifteen feet at a near side angle . probably best to verify with frigidaire , but i think from my experience it will work for you . 
i do n't know exactly , but i bought one and had it installed . it may be just to protect the actual unit . it also keeps it really secure in the wall . worth the little extra cash . 
if you 're in the same room , when the compressor kicks in , you 'll need to increase the volume on your tv . it 's not horrible , but it 's not quiet either . worth it for the cool it delivers . 
i personally used the frigidaire ea108t sleeve but the air conditioner comes with instructions for use with different brands of sleeves and also comes with different types of insulation for various sleeve installations . 
yes . it is 'thru the wall ' and uses a steel sleeve which is unvented on the sides , top and bottom . 
no . relatively quiet . i am happt with the purchase 
no the item just slides into the sleeve . i presume you mean the box that holds it in the wall 
i used the frigidaire ea108t 18 inch sleeve kit for the frigidaire ac ffta1233q1 12kbtu . fits perfectly . 
it is quieter than the previous kenmore window a c of 12k btu . i reviewed several brands and the frigidaire appeared to be the best choice , although i have had previous good experience with frigidaire . of course , it is not going to be as quiet as a central unit for the whole house , but acceptable and i would recommend it . the a c unit and sleeve arrived from amazon very well packaged and protected . read the instructions carefully . 
it is right behind the grates where the air comes out . you drop down the grate . the filter is right there . you wash it and put it back , or you can vacuum it from the front without removing the grate . 
it all depends on what your into . some people enjoy a big mouthful . 
it slides in nicely , but it 's a tight fit . 
hey ... if you can find a 5lb ock elsewhere , go for it . though i do wonder how you can have a 5lb ock made for you . ( maybe with a special mold ? and where will you get the ock to use as a base for casting the mold ? well , i suppose you could ask around and see if you can find enough people who will let you measure and weigh their ocks . the problem may be not only in selecting a ock that makes you happy and feels right , but keeping it firmly set up for a proper casting to make your own ock . ) 
no they are talking about the heavy plastic smell of the new pillow . it 's will take much more than 24 hours to air out . more like a couple days ... 
yes it comes with a `` sateen '' cover that zips at the end . make sure you take it off and leave the pillow to air out for at least 24 hours before you try to sleep on it though . 
it has a `` new foam '' smell for a few days , but after that i did n't notice . i do n't think its harmful , it just stinks when straight out of the package . 
this pillow is currently only available in a high-loft , plush . 
this is most comparable to the high-loft , plush memory foam pillows already offered by malouf . 
the approximate dimensions for the king size are 35 '' x 16 '' x 6.5 '' 
its a queen size and its in black . 
i purchased it as a queen & i have queen mattress on it & it fits perfectly . i think tht was a misprint . 
just the frame and headboard piece 
yes it will 
the frame will fit a queens size matter , the frame is bigger after the matter lay on th lex frame they are about two inches space on each side of the bed , the material is very feeble , the side board is broker and it 's not even a month since i purchase the bed . but after it assemble it is sturdy , just feeble material it compose of . 
id say 1 bowed which gives it the feel of a box spring per side per 2 inches probably like 30 total around 
greg , this box does not require a box spring . i have a 14 inch pillowtop ( 12 inhes of mattress and 2 inches of pillowtop ) . it works great . however , i did go to lowe 's and redid the middle support beam . the one that comes with it is very flimsy and snapped on me when i moved the bed to clean underneath within the first week i had it . i just bought a few 2x4 's and some screws . i had them cut the 2x4 's to the measurements that i needed and its very sturdy now . instead of one middle beam , i did two 2x4 's about a feet in from each side of the bed and added some additional legs . with the 2x4 's and screws that i bought , it was only about $ 18 . i highly recommend it though . 
yes . i puchased the queen size and its great . 
gel foam bed . 
it is black with black leather . 
4 5 16 '' x 5 3 16 '' x 7 8 '' 
yes . it sits in a hard tray and has a hard protective cover also 
yes . g , oz , ozt , dwt , gn , and ct 
i had to go and check . mine does not make a sound . i went beyond my usual modes and tried everything i could and , it never made one sound . 
yes it can be re-calibrated if necessary . when i do it the scale asks for a 1000.0 g weight . i do n't have any so i just check it with the smaller weight set i have . you can buy the weight on ebay for 17 usd or so . wish they stated this in the product description . good luck . joe 
find something in your house like a bag of being or some sort of item that has the weight on it and place it on your scale if the scale reads the same as the item it is oknickel weighs 5 grams you can use it for something small 
yes it does 
this scale will weigh in grams- by tapping the mode button until you get to the gram measure mode- starting at 0.0 grams . so , it will weigh items as light as 1 10th of a gram up to 2000 grams . yes , you can tare the scale to zero with a box or any other item on top . i purchased the scale to weigh my lighter stained glass pieces . i like the scale but wish the top were a little larger- it measures 4 '' x4 '' which may be ideal for your use . the scale has a hold button which i found useful . when you depress the hold button the display shows the final weight for about a minute and a half , then the scale turns itself off . i hope this info . is useful in your decision making . 
no , it will only read to the nearest 1 grain . 
yes , a stack of nickels works great . 
it would really depend on how heavy the person using the bed is . remember there is no box spring the mattress is held up by narrow metal slats . certainly would n't let kids jump on it 
hi , the space under the bed is 14.75 inches high , from inside legs is 74 to 75 inches wide , and it is 53 inches deep . 
hi , i have a tempur-pedic mattress on it which is quite thick . it 's larger than the standard coil mattress in thickness . it reaches to to the bottom of the low section of the frame 's arms . 
the same thing the bed is made of , metal . 
yes , memory foam mattress is good . i have it on my daybed and my niece said it was like sleeping on a cloud . 
a mattress that tall would sit above the frame on the ends furthest from the wall about 2 '' or so . the rest of the frame would rise above the mattress . we use a standard mattress on ours and at the lowest points it sits just below the frame . structurally , this bed is awesome and comes with tons of supports so the possible extra weight of the mattress would not be a problem . hope this helps ! 
i 'm not sure . i do n't recall seeing it in the instructions . we had 3 adults sitting on it and it was fine . i would recommend getting a `` bunkie board '' or maybe a piece of plywood to put under the mattress . overall it 's a great bed and i was happy with the purchase . 
i think you could because the base of the bed sits pretty high up from the ground . in fact you probably would have a significant space between the trundle and the bed i bet . 
china . it 's stamped on the handle . 
i do n't think so . mine is very sturdy . 
yes it would . for that matter any knife or sharp cutting device would scratch a non stick pan . i normally transfer my pizza onto a cutting board before i slice it . 
solid stainless steel metal 
the only difference in the models of botvac ( 70e , 75 , 80 , 85 ) is the supplies ( brushes and filters ) packed in the box . you can always buy the least expensive botvac now , and get the supplies later . compared to the older model xv , the botvac runs a lot longer on one charge , covers a lot more territory , moves faster and more efficiently and is about 10 db quieter . unlike the xv , it navigates my open floor plan without getting stuck in a continuous loop . i have only had the botvac for a week , and use it on a combination of hardwood and carpeting . now that the batteries are fully conditioned , the botvac runs two hours , then it recharges for about an hour , then it runs for one more hour to finish my whole place of 2500 square feet . the old model ran for 45-50 minutes per charge and would never finish my whole place in three runs . i had to have two neato xvs running at the same time to do the job , ( starting from opposite ends of my floorplan ) . so one botvac does the job of two xvs , and does a better job of picking up crumbs as well . 
yes ! it will get stuck . we have the same flooring , nearly all hardwood with persian rugs . we have found that neato is fine on rugs with 2-3 `` fringe but gets stuck on one with longer fringe . the solution has been to put a virtual wall strip just under the fringe on the rug ( which is only on two sides of the rug ) and the fringe completely hides the strip . the neato stays away from the fringe and enters and exits the rug from the side instead . this has worked for us . ymmv . but on shorter fringe rugs it does fine . 
unfortunately , it would suck it up . our dog had diarrhea while we were gone and it went right thru it . : ( that clogged it up , and it thankfully returned to its base . ( rather than dragging it thru the whole house ) it was a horrible mess to clean up . it was all in the brushes ... everywhere ! 
put it in the trash compactor 
that sounds right but it charges automatically as well when it runs out and continues cleaning . 
i have an xv-21 as well as the new botvac 80. when either unit ca n't make it 's way back to base to charge for whatever reason the clock will eventually lose track of time as well . i will say that i have not had an issue with the botvac returning to base to charge unless it gets stuck under something or behind something then it will die . and lose clock time . i will say the new botvac is quieter , battery lasts longer , and the bin is quite bigger . i 'm very happy with the new botvac series 80 . 
neatorobotics has a one year warranty on the botvac and a 6 month warranty on the battery . 
any of them will work on hard floors -- but one with a combo brush will be much quieter than one with just the blade brush . 
i 've been testing my new botvac80 the past couple days . on the first few cleaning runs the dust bin fills up and i have to take it out and clean it ( very quick and easy ) plus clean the filter and possibly the brush ( takes 5min or less ) should n't be expensive to maintain if the filter lasts several months with regular cleaning , but only time will tell . right now extra filters are not in stock and it might be quite sometime before the price comes down on them too . hopefully the brush and battery will last a long time too and not need expensive replacement , but that too only time will tell . 
the first few times it failed . it even made it back to within 6 inches and circled around beeping . but we we picked everything up and blocked off the couch and left for 3 days ( 6 cleaning cycles i suppose ) and came back to clean floors and it docked . so if we do our part it does fine . 
yes ... 
no . the bottom of this is 9 '' wide with an additional 1 '' slope . ( think pie pan ) 
the inside diameter is 9 1 4 '' and the outside is 10 5 8 '' . the spigot on my dispenser does not reach over the edge . but the stand is so pretty , i kept it and use it as a cake plate serving dish . 
yes , within nominal size variations . this mattress was a little taller and just wider and longer than the original mattress by about 1 2 inch . however the original mattress was a pretty poor piece of junk . camper mattresses are known as short queen or short king , and are about 6 inches shorter than the bed in your house . otherwise they are the same . this mattress is one of the best mattresses we have ever slept on , well worth the price . 
i would imagine you are allergic to latex given your question . it should state in the components what it is made of in amazon site if not call them they are great to talk to hope this helps 
i just used regular queen size sheets and pull them down on the end . it works fine 
i do n't know how much it weighs - it did seem heavy . the weather has no affect on this mattress . 
you would probably have to ask the manufacturer but i imagine they stay compressed for longer than that before shipping . they are wrapped in air tight plastic so as long as the seal is n't broken i would think it would be ok . 
the mattress is in our motorhome . the base it is on is a piece of plywood , not a traditional base . it makes the mattress firmer . you still sink in , but not as much . so you do n't have to `` climb out '' as you asked . we have another brand of memory foam mattress in our home and it has a traditional base and we had the problem you mentioned . we put a piece of plywood under it and it solved the problem . i hope this answers your question . 
probably because it is a special size order and not a standard size , still worth the extra $ 20 
great mattress my husband and i love it ! very comfortable . . 
not sure of exact weight but it is fairly heavy . i put it in my camper by myself while it was still compressed and wrapped in plastic . once it is unrolled and has expanded to normal size it would require probably require two people to move it . 
it is very soft and plushy . we love our mattress . 
you can i think but i have a frame that serves as the box spring as well . 
have only had the the mattress a week . i was expecting firm and i find it to be more a medium . this was the reason i purchased the cool gel mattress and yes , it is too hot . 
i sleep on my sides and back and it seems fine either way . i am sure it is temperature sensitive if you mean it 's harder in cold weather and softer in warmer weather as i think all memory foam mattresses are . if your asking if your body temperature will cause you to sink into a hole created by your body heat then no . my husband weights 260 pounds and he does n't sink into a hole . we have had this mattress only a few days and are happy with it . we have been sleeping on memory foam now for 12 years . this mattress is as good so far as our mattress that cost 1200.00 . 
i do n't know about rating , but do n't buy this . something they do n't tell you in description is you have to flip it every 2 weeks , we do n't have time or energy to flip a matress every 2 weeks . not happy this was not explained with the description of the matress . 
phyllis , the bed is pretty stiff , i do n't think it would work in an adjustable bed frame . my partner weights 205 lbs and his side of the bed has starting to show some indentations and the bed is not even , we bought the mattress july 2014. i think we should have gotten the more expensive one . we are planning to buy another one . 
i 'm not sure what you or the other review are talking about - mine is too firm if anything . i actually have a softer 1 2 inch pad on it . if you 're having trouble with it i would call the manufacturer or amazon . amazon is spectacular with order issues and brentwood is a us company which means they 'd be easy to contact and deal with . good luck with your order ! 
if you are comfortable on a slightly more than medium firmness inner spring , than my guess is the memory form should be fine . go try a med firm memory foam at a mattress store , it 's a free way to see it you would even like foam mattresses . we like ours ... 
that 's difficult to answer , since that 's a everyone 's anatomy responds differently . that said , i think it 's quite firm . not hard , but i never sink down into it . i do n't sleep on my stomach due to neck and back issues , so i ca n't say with any confidence when it would be like . but soft is not the way i would describe this bad . 
yes you have to rotate it 
you should rotate the mattress every two weeks . 
yes , i sleep on my stomach and i personally love it . 
yes , you can use any box spring ! 
you should be fine . the mattress is designed to be stored compressed . i would imagine that if it is stored for an extremely lengthy period , the time to achieve the real shape might be a little longer . it only took mine a couple of hours . i unpacked it the night i received it . 
i do n't know . we kept our box springs and put plywood between them and new mattress . sorry 
i recently purchased an 11 '' brentwood mattress for school . now , i have only owned the mattress for a few weeks , and have slept on it a total of about 5 times , so i am by no means as experienced with this mattress as others . with that being said , i spent some time in the local mattress stores exploring options because i was also on the fence about the 9 '' vs 11 '' . what i tended to notice in the store was that the thinner mattresses were slightly firmer than their thicker counterparts . the 11 '' brentwood is a medium firm , but a very comfortable sort of firm ( i.e . you do n't sink into the mattress more than a few inches , but it is really supportive ) . i imagine that the 9 '' would be just the slightest bit more firm , which could be great if you like a firmer bed . as for the gel keeping you cool , again i ca n't speak to much of the 9 '' , but the 11 '' keeps me cool , which is great because i usually wake up hot in my tempur-pedic at home . last i looked there was about a $ 40 difference between the 9 '' and 11 '' which is a significant difference for a mattress under $ 400 . really the decision for me was do i want to pay an extra $ 40 for 2 inches of foam and a maybe slightly more supportive mattress . i ultimately decided yes , but you ( more that likely ) will be happy with either . 
you may be able to easily secure it and fold it in half , but once deflated it is quite a mattress as a mattress should be . maybe a 7 or 9 inch would be a bit more friendly for your needs . 
it seems to go pretty fast , 10 minutes would be about 90-95 % expanded i 'd say 
if you were to stand on it or put a knee into it , you will sink into it because of the pressure being placed in one small area . when you lay on the bed it distributes the weight more ; it is an amazing sensation , as in , it is firm , but has this gentle soft touch to it that literally cradles your body . you do sink in a little more as you sleep and thats just the mattress forming to your body and thats why you sleep so well . i can tell you that i have a 10 year old daughter and a 7 year old son who love sleeping on my bed and sleep like babies . 
i would not do that . if you already have a bed frame with slates , you can go to a local lowes or home depot and buy a piece of plywood to put on the slates and then put your mattress on top of that . 
i am going to go to my home depot and get a piece of plywood to cover my wood slats . i do n't think you can put it right on the slats . not sturdy enough . but i have read that the plywood will work . 
therapeutic support base : 2lb ventilated cool airflow layer : 2lb memory foam comfort layer : 4lbs i emailed them and got this information . it should be reliable : ) 
i received paperwork for the warranty ; everything was included with the name of the company and contact info . 
this mattress is too firm for me ! i have tried and i toss and turn in the night . my shoulders ache in the morning ! ca n't feel the gel either ! 
you should not experience any pressure points , but you will feel what i can best describe as comfortable support . i have had some that i sank into so much that i practically had to get up to turn over . this is not that way at all . hope this helps . 
shipping weight : 50 pounds 
we let it sit for about 6 hours ... there was no mention on the instruction tag of any specific required time frame ; only thing it said was to rotate it every 2 weeks for the first 6 months . 
yes you just need to put a size up from what or is 
i 'm not sure . i just removed part of the bamboo cover and examined my mattress . there is a thin , gauzy , stretchy bag like cover over the entire foam mattress . inside this cover bag , there is 2 inches of blue green gel infused foam and another 9 inches or so of dense foam . everything is then inside the bamboo cover , which has a soft quilted top and sides . to me , this cover bag does not appear to be wool , but it may be . i 've just never encountered wool in this form . 
i no longer have the box , but it was quite long , one person could drag it but you would want a friend to help you lift it into a car . the diameter was about 12 '' x 12 '' and i would harbor a guess at about 7 feet , just like a bed . there was no `` wiggle '' room in the box . 
i would call it firm , but not super firm . i call it just right ! we tried medium and soft and found them to be to soft 
i do n't sell on amazon , so i hardly think you got bamboo towels from me . hope you find your seller . 
hello , the dimensions of our hand towels are 16 inches by 30 inches . if there is anything else we may assist you with , please feel free to contact us . 
hello carol , like with any other product , it can be bleached . we recommend using a small amount and not putting it directly onto the product . please let us know if we may assist you further . 
yes 
no worries , i did n't even use the instructions and i am mechanically challenged , so you should be fine . you put all of your poles together with the twist out part on the top . put a rubber ring on the pole first then a metal ring , then the basket . your rubber ring slides into the metal ring and the metal ring slides into the basket holding it in place , so just make sure you have the lowes basket on the pole first then work your way to the top basket repeating the above process . when you place the pole in your shower or wherever you want it , just place it in the corner of your area and twist the top of your pole to tighten it against the floor and the ceiling to hold it in place . good luck ! 
3in high , 8in deep , 11in wide 
plastic lock in place covers for the vertical tube work quite well . not sure why but they do . heavy items on one side of basket has no effect on shelf being level . 
could be possible , as you put it together and can use the poles as you wish . however , i do n't want to say it can be done , but the pole is in 4 pieces . hope this helps ! 
i had the same thing happen to me and now it just falls down every couple weeks . i filled out the `` contact us '' form on zennith 's website a few months ago and totally forgot about it until i got an email from amazon asking if i could answer your question . so thank you , i just reached out to them again ... 
installed nov. 13 , 2014 , so i really do n't know . product appears powder coated which is a good coating , has tape to cover joints , and appears to be doing ok but i ca n't positively say it wo n't rust . 
about 3 '' tall 
the box has the extension rod included . almost with i think three other rods . 
said to be rust proof , but in my experience they all rust eventually 
i have also used this mat , but have not met such a situation . maybe the mat is not dry when you bake with it . 
yes , absolutely yes . 
we do it all the time and it comes out great . 
i sure think these could be trimmed down . after closely looking at then i ca n't imagine why not . go for it ! 
they are 1mm thick , maybe slightly thinner than the more expensive ones . 
of course , this is very good mat ! 
we have baked at 500 and had no problems 
i have n't tried it , but it would probably work very well if the size is large enough for your pies . the smallest dimension is 11 5 8 '' inches . there are silicone pastry mats available here on amazon though which are the right dimensions and many even have the round pie markings for easy measurement . 
16-1 2 '' x 11-5 8 '' for each one . 
yes , it 's bpa free 
hi , you need just put the vegetable upright in the centre of the slicer 's cone , and twist it in with a consistent forward force to produce endless spiral strands . 
no , you would not want to cut the zucchini . average size and smaller zucchini will work . the blades are very sharp . it is easy to twist the zucchini . you will get long spirals of zucchini and get left with a cute knobby end attached to a long small spiral from the center . 
no , it 's fully manual 
no it is pure silicone . 
there is no fiberglass . 
yea it 'll fit . its how my wife bakes muffins . oven inside is around 11 '' wide by 9 '' . molds are around 9.75 '' by 6.75 '' each . 
hi mary , the heads of the spatula 's are 100 % pure fda approved , food grade silicone . the handles are plastic . hope this answers your question . 
kitchen starz silicone muffin pans clean up perfectly in the dishwasher with no spotting . 
the muffin pans are 100 % pure food grade silicone . absolutely no fillers ! 
the diameter is 2 3 4 '' at the top and 2 1 8 '' at the bottom . the muffin pans make standard size muffins . 
the dimensions are 2 3 4 '' diameter and 1.2 '' deep . standard muffin pan size 
our silicone muffin pans make perfect standard size muffins . the dimensions of the cavity are 2 3 4 '' diameter and 1.2 '' deep . 
hi james ! the muffin pans are standard size . 
not at all . the set is solid , there 's only the slightest bit of give all around . the ladle will not buckle under the weight of soup , sugar , or anything else you can think to put in it . the `` give '' along the edges is just barely enough to cause a slight squee-gee effect , but does not negatively impact the functionality at all . 
the spatula , though it is thicker than my other metal or plastic ones , is tapered on the edge . i doubted its ability to get under something fragile like a fried egg but i was very pleased to see that there is no issue . it works beautifully ! 
they were made in china , for an australian company . 
the utensils measure 11 '' end to end and the spatula ( pancake flipper ) is angled . 
hi there , in answer to your question we are trialling 2 new colors ( a dark grey and a teale-blue ) on 2 of our best selling products - the 4 piece spatula set and the 2 pack tongs - which will be in store in a few weeks . if the new colors sell as expected , we will roll it out to our entire range , starting with this 5 piece utensil set . best case scenario for this product in a dark grey is another 2 months from now . sorry if it 's not as quick as you expected but it 's high on the list for 2015 and we 're moving as fast as we can ! i hope this helps . best regards , matt - starpack co-founder 
yes , they are labeled on the packaging as `` bpa-free , fda compliant food grade silicone '' 
they feel as though they are all silicone and state in the paperwork they are completely coated in silicone . there is one item that has a metal core but the rest are microwave safe as well ! i really enjoy this product- i have had mine for about a week . 
hi nancy , we have just begun rolling out new colors to our range , including dark grey and teale ( blue-green ) . this product will likely be the next one to get the new colors , so hopefully in store by april 2015. i hope this helps . matt - starpack team 
hi cindy cat - at present cherry red is our only color , but we are looking to add some new colors in a few months time . colors we are considering are black , teale , green and purple . i hope this helps . matt - starpack team 
yes is it . 
probably not ( as i could n't find it on the disney store ) , but the tag on mine looked legit . the towel is well done and i have no complaints 
absolutely ! ! it would be perfect ! 
no . this is a cotton blend and not a good quality . 
no , 100 % cotton is not written on the towel . the bottom of the towel does have 'disney frozen ' written on it though . the picture posted for this towel is a picture of the tag . 
yes it is 
yes 
i had a hard time removing the locking ring too . have you tried soaking the base on a dish of warm water to loosen up any residue trapped in there ? that 's what i did , but i also had a sort of competition going with my sons to see who would unlock it , so after soaking it for a day , plus sheer strength , it worked . 
i was unable to find your blender model anywhere online including cuisinart.com , so i can not determine if this blade is compatible . but considering the high number of negative reviews regarding the quality of this blade ( mine included ) , i recommend avoiding it even if it does fit ; buy it from cuisinart instead . 
i do not know , but there are a few excellent appliance parts websites that help you find the answer . 
no 
if your blender is the smart power classic spb-6 the blade should be compatible 
yes , it works great ! ! 
yes it is according to the cuisinart website 
it all depends on your model of blender . this one fit ours , but only lasted two weeks before it shattered . 
yes 
it 's just a sticker , it easily comes off with no residue . 
no idea . i hand wash mine 
no , it is one solid cup . the lid and straw are the only removable parts . the straw is a bit delicate , as i found out when i put it in the sink and then placed a pot on top accidentally . 
nearly 10.5 '' and are made to fit the opening in the lid . i use 9 '' disposable straws so i do n't have to wash the straws that come with this cup , and these straws work just fine . hope this helps . 
i have not tried to freeze them . and i do n't think it would work very well . if the expanding liquid did n't break them , the extreme cold would probably make them more prone to crack 
the lid screws on with a rubber seal inside the cap . 
7 3 4 inches . 
yes 
yes 
it takes the same filter as the aqua-ionizer deluxe 7.0 and the akkah2o kei 501. it currently sells for $ 39.95 . it 's located here http : www.amazon.com gp product b00ae8bues 
normally not . the unit has a onboard filter included . you can always call us at 1 800 560-0436 to consult with a representative about your water quality . 
hi misty : not sure which white colored model you are talking about ? however , this is the only 7 plate ionizer at this price point . the alkaexpress kei 701 comes with a 60 day money back guarantee to allow you to test it to your satisfaction ! 
thanks for your question . they are solid . 7 plates of platinum coated titanium . 
it 's easy to install and certainly could uninstall and take it on vacation . 
it is made in china . 
they are manufacturered in china by a company that has been in business for over 20 years . along with water ionizers they manufacturer water treatment plants ro drinking water systems , standard water filters , water coolers and more . 
i do not think it is that loud . no more than any other . we make two loaves of french bread a week , it does work the machine , but mixes well and the bowl is big enough to keep the dough inside . i tried this machine for the price and i am pleased with it . i use it about every other day with something and i would purchase it again when i wear this one out . 
closed ( arm down ) , it is approximately 14 inches high . with the arm raised ( necessary for attaching the attachments ) , it is almost 19 inches high . 
yes it have the attachment gear socket but the meat grinder and pasta roller can not came with the machine . 
plastic . i had to return mine it did not work 
i do n't know but this beast is great and this three accessories is enough , i have used this in two months like 20 times and for the first time in my bakery life i could make buttercream in dominican republic . it worth more than it cost for me the accessories are great and theu are not plastic . 
my whisk attachment recently broke and i had to return the entire unit for a refund from amazon because they too could n't reach customer service for a replacement part . 
i have n't used mine yet - paint in the mix ? ? ? grossssss 
yes it 's close to the bottom , it works good , just a little loud when you use the balloon whisk , but when you use the other whisk , it is n't as loud , i like this mixer , i make alot of icing without having any problem . 
that is a fairly relative question . some consider hand mixers and submersion mixers to be loud . this is a powerful mixer - made for heavy loads - so i imagine it would disturb a sleeping cat - let 's put it that way . but it is stable on the table . 
yes . we invest heavily in testing and have a 31-page sgs report that examines all the materials used in the sealpod sticker lids . i do n't think i can include links here , but we can send it to you if you message us asking for it . but in layman 's terms , the lids are basically aluminum foil and glue . the glue is food-grade , as opposed to industrial . we know of other sticker-type lids that do not invest heavily in testing and who are using industrial glue . we wanted to point out the contrast . hope that helps ! 
at the bottom of this link they tell you which nespresso machines it 's compatible with : http : www.sealpod.net news category sealpod % 20bigsisinox95f9eae4c2 i ca n't see the c50 , try to contact the company . 
i am not certain , but i 'm pretty sure that it is not ... there is a huge size difference 
yes , the capsules compatible with nespresso inissia . 
with the nespresso machines that makes 3 holes in their nespresso capsules , the capsule are compatible with all of them . but the nespresso machines that makes 1 holes ( usually with a handler ) , the capsule are not compatible . ( because the machine makes the hole too deep ) 
the difference is in the remote . the ffre1233q1 includes a temperature sensing remote . this model does not include the temperature sensing feature . imho , the temperature sensing does n't work that well anyway , and is something of a gimmick , so buy this one and save $ 30 . but it 's your call ... 
1 year but u can buy a 2 yr warranty 
yes , it comes with a 2 piece window screen . it will work with windows up to 28 '' wide i believe . 
you can not use this unit for a side slide window , they make special units for side windows . they cost much much much more . 
all air conditioners create condensation . if you ca n't have the condensation spilling out the back outside on the ground , you will need a tube to divert the condensation to an acceptable location . 
no i have this in an older mobile home and it is just fine no support needed 
22 w by 24 w by 17 h 
well , that was an adventure ! i had to lean over from the window next over to take the measurement . the measurement from the glass outward is 15.25 inches . 
not at all ! let it rain all day and night and you will remain cool . great unit enjoy . 
we did not use a support mount and feel comfortable without one . 
i just installed it in a 21-inch window . it was very snug , with no room for the side panels , but it worked . 
quiet . 
61 lbs 
yes it will the unit itself is 19 inches wide . you wo n't need the accordion fan on both sides because there will be no room for it 
well , it 's 4 1 2 inches from the accordion panel to the front . so , if you look up the dimensions from front to back , subtract 4.5 inches and that should give you an approx . length to the back of it . 
short answer : not really for normal sleeper- long reply- noise level from fan speeds during operation is better than other unit 's i 've tried over the years , including previous 10k btu lg wall unit . bought two lg 10k units to replace a 13k heat cool sears unit in main living area of cabin and cut a c bill by 50 % . noise issue , when both lg units quit operating ( br still runs but thermostat is off ) . lady friend who can go to sleep with tv sound volume up does not get disturbed by this a c ( on in other room ) when she 's in town . i 'm a light sleeper and the frigidaire does n't wake me up despite the slight noise when trying to get to sleep ( noting again this frigidaire is in the main living area ( next room divided by wall and door , a c location is 25 ' from headboard in the bedroom ( bedroom a c is an lg which is a little noisier and left off unless deep into a hot n humid florida summer . the frigidaire wall banger in question is quieter . there is a light 'thump ' heard from compressor cycling on off which is normal for wall units . the main issue with this a c is the thermostat is not even close to actual temp , needing to be set 4 degrees lower and sometimes changed as the unit does n't shut off like it should on energy efficient setting ( nice for fan not to run full time like sears unit ) . note : this is annoying and if buying again would purchase the 10k btu lg unit instead of this unit . not enough difference in noise to overcome other issues . some folks i know , claim the samsung wall units are quiet but this is second hand , not first hand info from ... . davzway 
no . it automatically drips to the outside . 
the enclosure itself is 19 in wide and the height is actually 13.5 in . the 14.5 in . includes some metal bars that aid in mounting the unit to the window , but the actual enclosure itself is 21.5 in . long ( depth ) , 13.5 in . tall and 19 in . wide . i physically measured this with a retractable tape measure . 
i have model # ffre1033q1 . the amp draw is 7.7 in cooling mode . eer rating is 11.3. you can go to the frigidaire web site to get the complete specs . there are several 10000 btu models . the one you are looking for is the model number i indicated above . ac units are listed under home comfort . you can also down load the manual . 
yes it will . 
yes the back of the unit is open and the condenser coils are exposed . every unit designed to mounted in a window is going to have the condenser exposed out of necessity . the condenser must have maximum air exposer for the unit to work efficiently . putting anything over the face of the coils would be the same as blocking of the grille for the radiator on your car while driving it . 
depending on what state you live in most now require a metal bracket or brackets to support the air conditioner from outside your window .you can get one at home depot or any good hardware store , you might even find it on amazon so no the unit does not come with brackets . 
yes . 
probably has a higher capacity motor i do know that this a.c. is louder than i like . the compressor is n't insulated well enough from the interior portion and a lot of the compressor noise goes into the room . however it does cool great . 
approximately six feet with a a gfi grounded plug 
yes . 
i did n't notice this when my unit arrived 
forgot to mention yes it can be used as a through the wall permanent mount unit but you will need to buy the box that it mounts in separately and it will most likely need to be done by a contractor . 
i have two frigidaire acs and have never had drainage problems . drainage has not been an issue on amazon reviews either . that does n't mean you do n't have a drainage problem . you might need someone with ac knowledge to take a good look at how the machine is working as well as the installation fitting . hope this helped . 
hi there.. i do n't believe so ... it should work on any 15amp circuit ... . i do n't see what the amp rating is on the a c but i would assume it 's about 7.5-8 ... . which is probably less than a toaster ... . 
dear , you do not need to put a duvet over it , the silk is more than 2 lb , and all the silk comforter is about 6 lb 
i 'd imagine its a mistake . when i asked them a question , they were n't helpful at all . seems like its not a quality company . also , i returned mine right away . it was poorly made with broken threads which had been loosely tied together all over the surface . i found a much better one from au visio on amazon . i think that 's the name of it . a bit more $ but well worth it . 
the tag on my mulberry silk comforter says : do not wash ; spot clean only ; do not bleach ; do not tumble dry ; dry in shade ; iron low heat ; do not dry clean . 
dear , you need to add a duvet cover to this silk comforter , then you can wash the duvet cover , thanks 
dear , king size is 102-inch by 89-inch , queen size is 92-inch by 89-inch 
dear , king size is 102-inch by 89-inch , queen size is 92-inch by 89-inch 
2 1 4 inches , measured with the lid on . 
2ounces 
i asked the company about lids to fit ( regular mason jar size are way too big ) and he said they are planning to start stocking lids soon , so check back if you want lids for these . 
yes , there is a thin seal on the inside of the lid . it does n't cover all the lid . 
gosh , most glassware is , but i would n't put the lid in there . ( i do n't recommend microwaving anything . ) 
10.5 inches long 3 inches tall 2 inches wide 
yes , they are 2 oz . 
i have not personally tried to freeze anything yet , but they are glass so i do n't see why you could not use like a regular mason jar ( leave enough space for expansion ) . even if you do not use as intended , you wo n't be disappointed with these little jars . my friend uses the set i g ave her for salad dressings because they do not spill the liquid . 
they do not say , so i would assume - no . 
yes , i just received mine on feb 2nd and they had lids . 
it can hold 4 ounces , it is enough for adults and kids . 
good quality ? from china ? yeah , right . : ) 
well have no idea and if it does not say , then i would not order . use a dixie cup instead 
this is my issue . i just received the item and no where on the package does it state it 's bpa free . in fact , there 's no company listing on the package , all the writing on the package is full of misspellings , grammatical errors , and nonsensical phrases . i tried to google the company to make sure they were n't just sticking bpa free on the description as a catch phrase and can find nothing on them . i believe i 'll be sending these back . 
the dimensions is 4.5*2*0.7 inches , it can hold 4 ounces ; the star ice pop is 4.5*1.5*1.5 , it can hold 2.5 ounces ; the small ice pop is 2*1.5*1.5 , it can hold 1.2 ounces . 
the county is not imprinted on the spatulas , but i seem to remember scratching off stickers that said they were made in china . 
yes ... they are flexible at the scraper end ! i am one to get out every drop of cake batter , every bit of food from the pan and these are great for that ... i love them ! 
all silicone utensils i have had are good for high temps so i would assume these are as well . i have never used any of mine past 425 degrees . 
i did n't notice but i love them . every other spatula i 've had would break apart from the stick . 
sorry , do n't know but they are excellent ! i threw away all my other spatulas after using these . 
up to 450f 
yes , the wolfgang puck oven has a standard mode which cooks just like your traditional conventional oven . 
no ... it does not . 
no i found out it does n't . you have to buy the one that 's called the rotisserie series . i had this same problem . in the add the first thing it says it does is rotisserie . so i ordered it . then about an hour later i looked at the ad description and it did n't mention a rotisserie spit . so i called amazon and they thought it did to by how the ad read . luckily someone who bought this answered my question and they said this model did not . so i cancelled my order . then i find out the rotisserie model is almost 100.00 dollars more than this oven . 
a 10-12 lb turkey 
19 1 2 wide 12 high and 13 deep ( all inches ) 
if you use the pressure mode , the cooking time will be shorter , and you save time and energy . 
the oven was so bad , i sent it back . then i paid almost 100 dollars to ship it back . hated this . dangerous . it popped open once . 
yes you can cook ant thing in it . 
it is about the same side as an microwave 
i have n't tried but based on your ability to set the temperature as low as 150 i ca n't see why touch could n't if you 're looking to cook whatever it is during the same process . set shorter time at lower temp , no steam and check it after 5 minutes etc . then reset for normal cooking 
hi amber , glad to help : ) . yes , it is recommended that all ozone generators ( no matter what a manufacturer will tell you ) be used in an unoccupied space . unlike air fresheners that only mask odors , ozone generators remove odors by producing large concentrated amounts of o3 ( ozone ) which oxidize and break down residual odor compounds in the surrounding air . because the o3 is so highly concentrated , it is recommended that rooms be unoccupied during treatment . once the air treatment is finished though , the o3 quickly converts back into o2 ( oxygen ) and the room is left with a `` fresh air '' smell . most treatment times are approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of space being treated . we do also carry other types of air purifier units on amazon where the purifier can be left on in an occupied space . this purifier can be found here : http : www.amazon.com o-ion-permanent-purifier-ionizer-sanitizer dp b00fbmjk9y ref=sr_1_7 ? s=home-garden & ie=utf8 & qid=1399048163 & sr=1-7 & keywords=air+purifier i hope this helps and please let us know if we can possibly help with anything else : ) .

hi robert , glad to help : ) . all ozone generators require an ozone plate or cartridge in order to work . ozone ( activated oxygen , o3 ) is created when voltage is applied to the ozone plate cartridge to create a corona discharge . this corona discharge reacts with the oxygen present in the ozone generator chamber to create ozone . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) .

hi mickster , glad to help : ) . the ozone generator is generally safe for use in current and classic cars depending on the condition of the leather , plastic , etc in the car . however , if overused , ozone can be damaging to interior components of the vehicle such as rubber seals . most ozone treatment durations are for 30min to 2 hours depending on the level of odor you are trying to remove . the treatment can be repeated if necessary , but it is best to fully air out the car before repeating treatment . some precautions to take are to remove all trash and personal belongings and to thoroughly vacuum and wipe off all surfaces before treatment . here is a description with pictures to give you an idea of best placement and practices for the ozone generator in cars : http : www.wikihow.com do-an-ozone-shock-treatment-on-a-vehicle . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can possibly help with anything else : ) . 
glad to assist : ) . as a safety pre-caution , this ozone generator does not have a continuous run feature . this is because very highly concentrated levels of ozone can be a respiratory irritant , so more ozone is not always necessarily better . however , ozone does dissipate quickly and converts back to oxygen and this unit does have a timer function with a max 2 hour run time that is more than sufficient for most odor removal applications . the timer can be reset immediately after it ends , in the event that a 2nd purification treatment is needed . i hope this helps and please let us know if there are any additional questions we can help answer : ) . thanks ! 
hi dawn , happy to help : ) . yes , the ozone generator effectively eliminates musty and damp odors . the purifier cleans by producing activated oxygen ( o3 ) which oxidizes airborne contaminants , odors , airborne bacteria , etc to clean the air . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) . 
hi j , the ozone plate cartidge is made of ceramic . yes , this ozone generator will kill airborne mold spores and eliminate odor for a period of time . however , no ozone generator on the market ( no matter what a manufacturer will tell you ) will eliminate all mold spores in a contaminated area . this is because mold spores can hide in nooks and crannies in interior surfaces such as inside drywall and other porous material like clothing etc . that may not necessarily be reached by ozone purification . generally , ozone purification treatment is used after conventional mold clean-ups that involve a bleach scrubbing of contaminated surfaces . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) .

yes 
to me , the quilt is truly cream colored . i really like it , ordered the king for my queen bed- 
i try to find the matching shams but could not . i use my country rose shams and it still looks great but would love to find the matching ones . 
yes , it is a 450 watt motor using 120 volts . 
i believe the grinder ( and other attachments ) made for the bosch compact mixer will fit . unfortunately this model seems to have been discontinued by bosch , but there are third party manufacturers that make a grinder that will work with an additional adaptor . also , there may be some available on ebay ; i just purchased one on there for my styline and am waiting for it to come in . ca n't wait to try it out ! 
yes , this handles cookie dough well . the dough hook is the best attachment to use for cookie dough with this particular mixer . 
this mixer is made in slovenia and the additional attachments ( blender - muz4mx2 & citrus juicer - muz4zp1 ) can be purchased several places online . 
this machine can handle up to 5 pounds of dough . if you are wanting to do more , then you would want to use the bosch universal plus mixer . 
this is 120 volts and is made for use in the usa . 
the transparent lid with filler hole refers to the stainless steel bowl lid . 
not sure of actual dimensions , it was a gift for my mom . i do know it is very compact and fits nicely on her limited spaced counter . she is bet pleased ! 
this is 11.5 '' tall 
hi , i 've used the bosch styline mixer a couple of times and still have not used the clear lid when making pizza dough , cookies and cakes . you can operate the mixer with the lid on or off . yes , ingredients can fly out , but i 've never had that problem ... yet : ) 
greetings . each link is closed but there is no solder , or anything other than stainless steel for that matter . and yes , this scrubber can be used on cast iron . thanks for checking in . knapp made products 
for all of our products we try to keep the work in the us . but the only place chain mesh of this quality ( 316 grade stainless steel ) is available is china , so that 's where we get it . polishing , finishing , assembly and packaging are all done in the usa . 
i bought for a cast iron skillet and works great . 
i usually rinse under hot running water : if something like egg residue is stuck to it i let soak in a bowl of hot soapy water for awhile . should be fine to clean in the dishwasher . 
hi , the chainmail dishcloth was developed to clean the cooked on residue that builds up on the bottoms and sides of good cookware - stainless steel , hard anodized aluminum , copper , enameled cast iron , etc . it also works very well on glass casseroles and other baking dishes . the customers are telling us they use it on everything with great results . some brands of new stainless steel cookware have a real mirror-like finish . i would not recommend using the chainmail dishcloth on that surface - it is a steel utensil and you should always be careful of using steel on steel with new pots and pans . 
the chainmail dishcloth is made from the finest restaurant food grade stainless steel . it will never rust . knapp made products 
it is 5 inches x 6 1 2 inches . thanks for the reminder . we 'll get the dimensions onto the product page . 
yes this humidifier needs water to work . also you may add 1 drop of oil per fill . and replace the filter every 2-3 months with a filtrwix sold in amazon 
the humidifier works with a usb outlet on a computer . most wall chargers for ipads have 2.1a outlet power , which is more than the power from a computer . so it should work with a ipad wall charger . 
i do n't think it purifies . it just adds moisture mist to the air but i did not see any feature to take in air and purify it . 
the company has them . you should be able to email them from amazon . hope this helps . 
yes 
i would email the kruzco customer service , they replaced one for me because the lid would n't seat properly . not had a problem with it shutting off after 4hours . k 
it comes with a usb cord . 
it only comes with a usb cord . 
no , this humidifier does not have a switch to turn the light off . 
yes , i have found wall usb chargers can be found for as cheap as a $ 1 . you can find them at most stores . newer cars already have the usb port , same with computers . you can plug this usb cable into any usb ports . 
yes . i set the oven to 375. the top reached about 180 deg . the left side was about 20-30 deg less than the top . the right side ( where the controls are ) just got warm . hope this info helps . 
those are box dimensions . the outer oven dimensions are roughly 20w x 11h x 13d , not counting the front handle , but the functional depth is more like 15 inches , as there are protruding elements on the back . 
erik , per the manual and my experience using the oven , the maximum temperature for baking is 450 degrees and can be adjusted downward in 25 degree increments . lowest temperature that i have seen is 175 degrees on the keep warm setting . the broil function has a fixed temperature of 500 degrees . it is the default temperature setting for broil and can not be adjusted within that function . i hope this helps . 
yes , it does have a nonstick interior . there 's a lot of misinformation here . this is right in the product description on the product page : `` the easy-clean nonstick interior is so roomy ... '' 
3 years . one of the best ( if not the best ) among makers of convection toaster ovens . 
it does have non stick . racks ... ..no . pans ... ... .yes . 
i thought i had read somewhere else also that it is aluminized steel but i ca n't find that reference . at first cuisenart customer service , when i complained about the persistent burn-off smell told me it was because the ovens are coated with a nonstick teflon-like material , but when i mentioned that i heard that model used aluminized steel he said he forgot , that model does . but it is highly suspicious . they claim anything that touches the food is bpa-free , but that would not include the nonstick interior . the question of the nature of the interior coatng was asked on a website for a large retail chain that seems to pride itself on offering ptfe pfoa free cookware . four days ago their customer service staff posted the following answer to the question which was posted three weeks prior ( it 's interesting that 3 different previous questions were answered directly by cuisinart , but this one was from the retailer 's customer service staff ) : `` this cuisinart chef 's convection toaster oven 's interior has a non-toxic heat resistance xylan coating that meets and exceeds food safety regulations . staff '' xylan is similar to teflon . here is an interesting website that describes various coatings and their manufactures . there are nonstick coatings that are at least twice as good as xylan , but is seems they are used for the better cookware . http : www.thecookwareadvisor.com what-do-you-mean-its-not-teflon 7. manufacturer : whitford brand name of non-stick coating : xylan popular brands that use it : joyce chen woks , helen chen woks about the coating : for the budget cookware . company gives it a 4-6 out of 10 rating . 
try two dozen at the same time . i love this oven ! 
there are two quarts heating elements located at the bottom of the oven . the front element is protected by three rods and the rear heating element is protected by a rod and does have a shield that covers the heating element from end to end . 
no , it does n't make the room hot . i cook my pizza in it now . it does a great job . a very good item ... wish i had gotten it a lot sooner ! 
yes i have washed them in the dishwasher and they are fine . 
no where on the box does it say it is bpa free . it says it is food safe . made in china . who knows . we bought it as a joke since our son always wanted a `` taco truck . '' 
no , just the standard . 
you get a set of 2 , one salsa red and the other guacamole green 
they are approximately 5.5 '' x 3 '' x 2.5 '' and you get a set of 2 , one salsa red and the other guacamole green 
just corn so far and they are great ! 
108x102 . for this set it only comes with 2 pillow cases . we also have listings with 4 pillow cases . send me a message and i can send you the links of all of our splits . 
thank you for your question . the fitted sheets are designed to stay on the mattress when the bed adjusts and extends . these sheets are made from microfiber , the threads are ultra thin ( micro thin ) and that is why they there is such a high thread cont . regardless , they are very soft . 
18 inches 
mine does 
the cord when you unwind it is 40 inches . 
it 's about 8 '' tall with cup and attachments . but more to what `` i think your asking is '' , the interior mixing part holds 1 1 4 c of liquid . so base what it will hold and grind off that . it works very well i try to grind all of my spices prior to using them . i like this little sucker and would purchase another if need be . 
on the bottom it says made in china . 
will grind 3 4 of a cup no problem . 
yes . super powerful . 
no , you vary the time you to change the grind . the longer it is on the finer it gets . 
does look the same , and both are 250 watt . one difference i see is nesco has 1 year warranty ( http : www.nesco.com files pdf bg13_blade_coffee_grinder_careuse_trilingua_r5.pdf ) , epica has 3 year ( as stated in manual ) . they have different service addresses -- but does n't mean it is n't the same manufacturer . note , on the bottom of the epica is is marked `` intertek 3015314 '' -- if you want to compare to the nesco if it 's the same . 
spices do n't leak under the blade area per say . very fine powder gets under the aluminum cup because it comes over the top of the aluminum cup . however , no powder gets inside ( where the electric motor is ) the black housing unit . this is a very small amount of fine powder that builds up after repeated use . again it 's a very tiny amount like a thin layer of dust . 
when i grind pepper corns , i strive for `` cracked pepper '' , but i always get a bit of `` fine ground '' even though i check the results after each pulse . that 's to be expected with a blade type processor . i 'm happy with the resulting `` mix '' . 
no . the blades are attached to a screw on lid . you remove the cup with that lid , unscrew the blades and then put your drinking lid on . 
it does ! it has a little book with 30 recipes i believe . 
yes , the user manual states that the cups are bpa free . hope this answers your question . 
i am not sure what you mean by `` wet grinder , '' but tonight i used the ninja to make dosa batter from 1 4 cup of red lentils and 3 4 cup long-grain white rice , plus the water i had soaked them in , and it easily made a beautiful smooth batter . not grainy at all . i also made a dosa batter of 1 4 cup from red lentils and 3 4 cup of whole-grain basmati rice the same way . that also came out nice and smooth , but it did take a bit longer and i had to add extra water because the mixture failed to move around enough inside the container so it could all be ground well . i think this was due to the rice being whole-grain , and not the fault of the ninja . i would not try to grind soaked rice without adding enough water . you could probably grind dry things like flax seeds , which 'flow around ' when i grind them in my little mr. coffee grinder , but things that have been soaked want to stick to the sides of the container , rather than flow the way we need them to . i would say , give up on trying to use the ninja to `` dry grind '' anything that has been soaked . now i have the two mixtures , which are the consistency of pancake batter , fermenting in two bowls covered with plastic wrap , and i am looking forward to eating dosas tomorrow night . 
yes 
yes , you can use real fruit too 
i am just researching to choose which to buy , so i have n't used it , but i came across a consumer report on the nutribullet and they said the new model had blades crack and break off when crushing ice . this is a huge safety concern , as you drink directly from the container and would never see a small piece of blade until you drink it . they did say the old models did n't have that problem . they recommended the nutri ninja instead , for safety and reliability . 
this unit is hands down the best ! i researched for hours ; now that i own it ... all i can say is that it works better than expected - with all greens , fruits , veggies , etc ... ..in seconds ! ! ! great but ! 
yes you can purchase additional blending cups . 
after using it for a couple of days , my thoughts have changed . yes it 's noisy , but it 's not on that long ( 10-20 seconds max ) . when i first used the nutri ninja pro , it was ~ midnight or 2am in the morning so it was definitely noisy when all was quiet and there was no ambient noise . when i used it the following day , around lunch time , it did n't seem as noisy , when there were other ambient noises in house and outside . so for those concern about noise . i would suggest getting it , trying it , if you do n't like it return it . after all noise is subjective . i would n't want anyone to miss out because of my experience ... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ original review after using in only one time in wee hours of the morning ... yes , it 's very powerful ; however , i found it to be very noisy in comparison to the basic nutribullet ; however , the basic nutribullet is n't as powerful either . perhaps it needs to be broken in first . i just purchased mine yesterday evening and family said they hope i do n't use it in morning while when they are sleeping ... it 's noisy enough that i may return mine . i 've owned magic bullet , nurtribullet ( 2 ) , vitamix 5200 & 6300 and this seems louder for the basic blending it 's doing . 
yes it works great i love it . 
diameter -- 2.75 '' depth -- 1.25 '' 
no , it is slightly tapered like a regular muffin cupcake pan . 
yes ! 
it does turn white when you twist it so i guess that means it has fillers . also the cupcakes do not pop out very cleanly . i have had other silicone muffin `` tins '' that the muffins would pop out with out leaving any residue . i was n't really keen on that . especially since i bought the mini muffin and some of them broke when removing . 
have n't had mine long enough to have this happen . 
this is a standad size 12 cup muffin pan . 
from what i can tell , yes . 
i 'm not sure on the exact ounces , but they hold about a quarter cup of liquid so that must be about two ounces . 
one inch deep 
yes , it does have a 20 year warranty . they have all the warranty information on their website . dreamfoambedding.com 
it 's one mattress but the foam inside is separate so each person can have a different comfort level . it 's awesome ! 
we 've had this bed for 2 years now and i have not experienced this problem whatsoever . our mattress is very comfortable and i would buy this again for sure . 
foam beds will work great on a platform bed frame , a slatted bed frame ( as long as the slats are not more than 3-4 inches apart ) , or a foundation with a frame . a foundation is going to look exactly like a box spring , but it has no springs in it . the foundation will create the same type of surface as a platform bed . as long as you put the mattress on something that creates a very rigid and very firm support the mattress will do great . 
79 x 75 x 11 inches ; 75 pounds same dimensions as a standard king size mattress . 
6 pieces ! i have n't noticed mine getting hot and it seems to be holding up great ! 
you 'll definitely need to purchase some sort of foundation . we got a box spring but i think one of the more solid foundations that are made for a memory foam mattress would have been a better choice . 
it does have a zipper and it 's pretty high quality quilted mattress material . no one would ever know you have a foam mattress system ! it looks like a very nice quilted mattress that happens to unzip all around . i have n't washed mine , but i 'm sure it can be ( maybe dry cleaned at the least ) . 
it can . though there should be something like close to together slats or a piece of plywood as the base directly underneath the mattress . 
yes , all three are of different firmness . 
jane , only the king is split down the middle so each side can adjust . if ordered through dreamfoam you can request that we split the queen in half and we can do that for you . please let me know if you have any other questions . thank you 
kurt , the mattress has a quilted cover on both sides . one side is quilted a little plusher and the other has a firmer quilt . this is how you are able to get 12 different combinations . you can get 6 different combos per quilted side . please let me know if you have any other questions . 
yes , definitely ! there is no spring inside , so it will bend following the adjustable bed . i have it in my trailer , underneath the bed there is storage , when i lift the lid of the bed , the mattress also bend following the curve of the platform . 
each of the 3 layers were a little over 2.0 lbs ft3 . the foam itself appeared to be a high density well made foam . 
each layer is a 2 lb . polyfoam density . 
yes this mattress can be used on an adjustable mattress . if sold and fulfilled by dreamfoam bedding we can split the layers on the queen for you but if you purchase directly from amazon the queen size wo n't be split . 
this mattress is quilted on both sides , one side is a tack and jump quilting which gives a little softer feel and the other side is a continuous quilt which is a firmer feel . this is how you get the 12 different levels of firmness . please let me know if you have any other questions . thank you 
i 'm guessing they mean if you add the mattress covering , as it is pretty plush . however , the foam layers in our mattress are not the same thickness . some are thicker than 3 '' and some are thinner . 
each layer is a different density , giving more or less support and comfort . i would suggest you contact the manufacturer directly and ask them . the company makes numerous types of beds . you can find there phone number on there web site www.dreamfoambedding.com . they are very friendly and helpful . 
i do not have memory foam in mine . i 'm not an expert , but memory foam conforms more to your body and you see an impression for a couple of seconds . the high density foam does n't act the same way . 
the fan on low is crazy loud on our 6 month old unit and when the compressor kicks in you can hear it on the other side of our small building . it is in a small 5 by 7 room with a closed door to keep some computer equipment cool so the compressor runs rarely , but the fan is loud enough to hear down the hall and in near by offices on that side of the building.. 
as long as the tube fits snugly through what you rig up , and there 's good insulation around the edges to seal out the outside air , there 's no reason it could n't work . 
this is a single hose ac unit . 
yes it has a timer . up to 24 hrs timer in one hour increments 
i would say about 5 feet if stretched out . if you mean the window adapter , it comes eith extra extendable panels , i have about a 3 foot window but has enough for maybe 5 feet with all the panels . 
yes , it should . 
it ca n't go in a window , but it needs to be near one to vent the exhaust ( hot air ) . if your table is strong enough , you could put it on a table , but the unit is pretty heavy and possibly bigger than you expect . it would probably look a little odd . 
no , very easy . put the pieces together with the screws included , add the strips of weather foam and shut the window . 
i think this was meant to sit on the floor and can be moved from room to room as needed.my daughter lives in a town house and uses this to cool the upper level . 
you need access to a window for exhaust and a hose ( or something ) for drainage . 
i chose the 13 '' gel because i like a softer mattress & the rating was softer than the thinner mattresses . it has worked out excellent . i am a big guy ( 6'2 ' & 345 lbs ) & it feels like i 'm suspended in a cloud . i do n't ever feel like i 'm bottoming out , even when i 'm sitting . my wife is small ( 5'7 '' & about 125 lbs ) & she loves it too . it 's a perfect fit for us , as we both like softer mattresses . if you also prefer softer ones , i 'd recommend the 13 '' , especially if you have a larger family member . if you prefer a firmer mattress , you might want to consider one of the thinner ones . the gel foam is cool , by the way . i tend to get hot at night & this mattress is at least as cool as , if not cooler , than my previous air-adjustable mattress . much more comfortable too . wish i 'd gotten this years ago . hope this helps ! ! goodnight ! ! ! 
i would say around a 6. after sleeping on it for about a month , my side is gone to almost a 7 ? i am a 300 lb man . you do n't just sink into it . after laying you can feel your body slowly lower a little . not like some couches where you need help to get out of the sink hole . i hope this answers your question ? feel free to ask anything else . john c . 
my experience is a reduction in back pain which i have suffered with for years . however , i have had an increase in hip pain . the bed is soft enough that i sink in some and it cradles me . i believe the increase in pain is related to the fact that i no longer toss and turn . i think my body had become so used to moving that i stiffen up a little not moving . the bed is definitely softer than i would like , but i do sleep through the night which is new for me . i would call the bed comfortable , supportive is not the first word that comes to mind . in our household we spend quite a bit of time sitting in the bed and it is much more comfortable to sleep in than to sit on . for us , it has been an improvement over a traditional mattress . 
24 hours 
2 '' . sorry , i could n't resist . actually , we have had both and the 13 '' provides much more support and comfort for everyday use . i use the 11 '' in my guest room but the 13 '' is my nightly friend ! 
yes 
no 
i use a woolrich topper , ( got it at target ) just so i have extra fluff ... ... ii never have any aches anymore when i get up in the morning , i did on my conventional bed . 
yes , definitely ... just make sure you 've got enough slats to support it properly . ( btw , this is a *great* mattress ! ! ) 
i know this was asked a while ago , but i emailed the seller after i received the mattress ( which , i have only been sleeping on for two days but am very happy with so far ) . they emailed back that the 7-inch base layer of high-density foam is a 4lb density ... not sure about the others , but the base layer is most important when determining the overall durability , comfort , etc . i consider 4lb to be perfect for me , as that is on the medium-firm side . 
i 'm not quite sure how to answer that . for everyone it would be different . when i first got on it , i thought it would be to soft . but when you settle in , its so perfect for me . i am 5'8 160 lbs and my hubby is 6'5 280 lbs . we are both extremely happy with it . i would totally give it a few days to get used to though . especially if you have never used memory foam before . i can say honestly , if i had to make the choice again i totally would choose this mattress . the squishy side thing is the only thing to get over , which i have . hope that helps . k 
if the platform bed has a solid wood surface for the mattress it will perform the best for you . if the bed frame had wide spaced slats or rails , buy some plywood to use as a base under the mattress . platform beds with very close spaced slats should work well with this mattress . 
density is over 4.5 but due not buy the bed unless you like a hard bed . the bed is so hard my wife & i are having a hard time sleeping in the bed with out hurting all night . tried to return it . brentwood would not help in anyway with letting me buy packaging to send it back . 
yes . but i would recommend a bed frame with a middle support bar . 
compressed rolled up an in rectangular shaped box . basically open plastic roll it out let it expand before using mine only took a few hours to expand fully , opened in the afternoon and used that night . 
mine have two inch gaps between and it works fine . 
yes it does . do not get this matress . 
i just put a mattress cover on , it does n't need any extra padding . 
i havent had it for a year but i wanted to tell you that its a pretty hard mattress i 'm hoping it will soften a little bit 
i 'm really not sure . it is quite heavy , but i was able to move it myself . when i took it out of the box , i laid it in the middle of the bed and was able to easily roll it out . because i did it this way , i have no idea how heavy the mattress is once it `` inflates '' to its full size . it obviously has some weight to it because it never moves off the box spring . 
it would need to be close to a window for ventilation . its suggested to be no more then 4 feet away from the vent source . 
no it does not but it is easy to set it up that the window wo n't open . if the window does n't have lock one can be installed 
yes , if you are referring to the window installation kit , it does come with it . `` unit must be vented to the outside ( use included window installation kit and follow detailed installation instructions in the owner manual . ) '' 
my son installed and said was easy -- - tho that depends on the type of window you have 
its what you 'd expect from a regular ac unit . i do n't even notice it . 
not long enough 
yes 
yes it is but i ca n't tell u the diameter because it 's put away for the winter . you can find several videos on the internet about this unit . 
calling it black would be a bit of a stretch . i 'd call it grey or charcoal . 
it runs like a window ac with a compressor and freon 
yes it does . air conditioners work by transferring the heat in the air into the refrigerant contained in the unit 's coils , thus cooling the air . in order to keep cooling , that heat has to be exhausted to the outside air . 
yes , all comes with 
the website says the decibel level is 55 dba . 
have n't had it very long but it is not supposed to need to have the water tray emptied , unless humidity is exceptionally high . 
wattage 1,080 , voltage 115 , amps 9.6a . i use this portable unit to cool my art studio which is a 10 ' x 10 ' straight-sided tent erected inside our covered screened back porch , making my work space usable all year round even in brutal texas summers . it works for me ! 
the description says it does indeed have auto-evaporation . 
get at least 20 ft. it is much harder to set up than it tells you . at least the wheels will have some moving around room if you want to move the a c to a different spot . i did n't even know about the 20 ft. lengths or i would not have sent mine back . it cools great . but the exhaust is powerful and hot . the 20 ft. sections do not come with the unit . just in case you did n't know . hope it helps . 
hello , it is recommended to use the window vent installation kit that is included with the package . as for floor venting , as long as it is not hazardous you may use it as you wish . sincerely , planet 73 
good afternoon , you may use the window installation kit to vent exhaust air outside . in order to use the window kit for the vent , you will need to remove the screen . you may check the link for the manual for a better idea . http : www.manualslib.com manual 715586 lg-lp1014wnr.html ? page=16 # manual 
19 1 2 '' w x 12 1 4 '' h x 20 '' d 
according to the product details it weighs 57 lbs . 
my window is 30 '' and the side panel are not fully extended so it seems likely . 
they are in the discription . product dimensions : 19.4 x 19.6 x 12.4 inches ; 57 pounds 
well the window would have to be at least 20 inches that would give you 1 2 inch to squeeze it in and i measured the max , is 31 '' but the specs say 36 '' 
60f 
the manual says it will fit in a window as small as 22 inches wide and 13 inches high . my window is 23 inches wide and with both guide panels installed it just fit . 
yes , it has an energy saver feature that does exactly that . 
yes , but it must be a heavy duty or industrial strength cord . 
the remote works at about a 45 degree angle from the side , it might work the same angle vertically . 
it depends on the height of the window . the window kit did not help in my case . the lip was not long enough the buldge right after the short lip made it unusable even for an up and down window because of the window ledge so for a side window you will definitely have the same issue . when i try to use it it was so awkward it kept popping out . i had to build some contraption to make useable even then i still have issues . 
we do promotion on some holiday period . so , it 's better to buy in these days . 
yes , you have to pour water in . 
110volt 
no , it doesnt drip water . you could put water or without water . it doesnt matter . if you put water , the air will come out cooler . 
if the fan is shut off , the unit is off . 
hard to measure exactly , but i 'd say 1 1 2 inches . i love mine ! it 's so very comfortable on top of my memory foam mattress . i 'm getting ready to order one for my king-size mattress as well . hope this helps . 
the one i have here is the bamboo one . it is stretchy , but not a nylon material . it fits a deep pocket mattress better though . my other bed is not as deep , and it fits a bit loose . it is fine with tight fitting sheets though . 
there is a elastic band that is sewed to the pad and it pulls down over the mattress . our mattress is 7 inches and it tucks under it about 2 inches . i would say probably up to 9 inches would fit . 
yes and yes it all works very nice 
yes , it has that stretch fabric that wraps tightly around any mattress size . 
the pockets are deep and have plenty of stretch . do not know measurement , topper is not at house . 
yes . the pockets are deep , about 15 '' 
hi ! all of our sheets and mattress toppers fit up an 18 inch mattress ! if you have any other questions or concerns , please feel free to ask ! thank you ! -eluxurysupply customer service 
it might . i have a blow up mattress . and i know i ca n't put a fitted sheet on it but the pockets on this is made of stretchy material so it just may work . 
hello ! our toppers are not made with isocyanates . if you have any other questions , please let us know ! thank you for your interest , rachel eluxurysupply customer service 
approximately 1 2 '' to 1 '' . we absolutely love it . very very good quality 
well you have to choose your size . but if you 're asking how deep , i can say there was plenty of extra stretchy wrap material to cover your the sides of the mattress 
i think it would be more like polyester not a crinkly papery material . very quiet and soft . you will not be disappointed . 
no sorry . i do n't think it will . 
my mattress is 8 '' . it stays put . 
my new mattress is firm and has rather hard `` buttons '' quilting it , which always seemed to be underneath hips or elbows . ouch ! the mattress pad covered them well enough that i do n't feel them . and it feels soft and cool . 
the dimensions are roughly 72 x 76 
we have a regular queen with another 4 '' thick mattress under this and it still fits really well 
it 's soft & comfortable . it 's a fitted topper about an inch thick . 
i believe that it would . it stretches nicely like a fitted sheet around my mattress . 
hi joy ! i just dug out my box - the four sizes are : 21 cups ( 5.0 liters ) , 12.7 cups ( 3.0 liters ) , 6.3 cups ( 1.5 liters , and 3 cups ( 0.7 liters ) - all are nested together and all come with lids . these containers are really amazing and we use them every day for storage and cooking . i find myself wishing i had another set ! 
the approximate sizes are , large l10 '' w10 '' h 5.25 '' 2nd l 8,5 wq 8.5 '' h 4.25 3rd l 7.5 '' w 7.5 '' h 3.5 '' l 4th h 5.5 '' w 5.5 '' h 2.5 '' all containers are tapered so bottom dimensions are a bit smaller . 
i have also had this problem . otherwise , i love the product . perhaps , the manufacturer can answer this question . 
they have a really tight seal once you squeeze out the air . 
mine are seal tight . i just push down the lid , and the cover is sealed 
this is n't meant to attach to any other product . it simply has a valve that allows you to press a little bit of extra air out , it does not allow for a vacuum attachment of any kind to suck air out . 
it never has with me and i have a high power microwave . really love to freeze in them . no ice buildup in them . 
i do n't believe so , they have a specially designed valve thing for the vacuuming . u just press on the lid and it goes out the mechanism . i do n't think this would work with an other devices . the valve thing has a 'skin ' over it to lock air from coming back in , i do n't see how you could bypass that . 
# 5 
yes both exterior and interior 
get on a diet 
china 
no but it does n't leak 
any tumbler straw will work . have n't been able to find that actual straw . 
no , just # 2 but it 's worth buying . walmarts are now selling them . 
bought one from bed bath & beyond for $ 9.99 . may 2014 
yes , but what would you put in the snack cup ? maybe peanuts ? 
i have seen 4 different color schemes in the stores ... that 's the only way you would be able to choose what you get 
cheap ours broke ! 
it comes assorted , so no way of picking a color and the listing is for 1 cup only 
it comes with a measuring cup to pour water into the unit . and there is a hot air tunnel , similar to a dryer , and an adjustable window gap fitting . 
this is 9000 btu unit . putting water will get colder air . 
hello , most likely you can put 1 and the pillows . thank you 
hello , any household vacuum cleaner will work even the size does not matter as long as it has good suction . all you do is remove the vacuum handle and place the hose on top of the suction cap and turn it on ; it will do the job . thank you 
hello , it depends what you mean by outdoor . how long they will be outdoor under what conditions ? because direct sunlight and extreme weather will damage the bags . thank you 
the mega is holding two large comforters 
this is straight from the supplier : please note the duplication . storage army bag sizes : small : 40x60cm medium : 50x70cm xxl : 60x100cm gigantic : 100x80x40cm jumbo : 85x120cm ( the biggest size in the market ) jumbo hanging 120x70cm mega : 100x80x40cm we have 1 set that includes 10pcs mix size : 2x 60x100cm , 3x small 40x60cm , 3x medium 50x70cm , 2x gigantic 100x80x40cm 
we were confused when it arrived packaged as it was . thought we 'd made a bad mistake ordering it on-line but it opened up easily and is very comfortable . be sure and put it in the rv before you open it . 
there is a 10 year warranty . no it does not jiggle . 
it weighs around 85 lbs . 
it does n't sag , and you ca n't feel the coils , and it is firm . thanks , just what we were looking for ! ! jon 
all of our queen size mattresses have 690 coils . 
yes it does come compressed and rolled up . 
generally , the thicker the mattress , the more plush soft the mattress will be . the 8 '' is designed for back sleepers . the 10-12 '' is designed for back side sleepers . the 13 '' is designed for all around sleeping , including on the stomach . memory foam mattresses will contour to your body during your rest , as it reacts to temperature . it will support your full body by contouring to your body shape . our spring mattresses , still give support , as your body will contour to the individually wrapped coils . 
i do n't see why not . there were no warnings from the co. i would use my heated mattress pad with no reservations . have a good day . 
not sure what the spring count is , but my husband both weight over two hundred pounds . we love our mattress , made living in the travel trailer while my husband worked out of town bearable ! 
there is about2 inchs of memory on the top hope this helps 
1 year parts and labor 
its says in the description is has evaporative technology so no water to remove.. `` *auto evaporation system allows continuous use without removing water '' 
the lg lp1414shr , 14,000 btu consumes approximately 1,380 watts . thank you for your inquiry . 
the venting brackets that come with the unit are designed to mount in a window , but if you can find a way to mount it to the wall vent i would think it would be fine . 
in high humidity it will lack in coolness , will hold a comfort level but not to cold 
it does come with a large venting hose and all the necessary trim pieces to fit it in most standard slider windows . we used it in florida and it never needed to be emptied and kept 600 sq ft area comfortable ( low 70s ) . 
it must be vented out to a window . 
it does produce noise , but quieter than my last unit . 
a box spring is optional ( not necessary ) . bed comes with a slat support system . thanks , modhaus 
yes 
4 inches 
it sounds like you may be missing another box . i thought the same thing but then a 3rd box of slats arrived a little later . 
no 
yes . the mattress sits on top of the frame and not sunk down into the frame . it 's a good looking bed that with the mattress does sit lower to the ground than our other beds . we use it as a guest bed and it adds a little challenge for our elderly parents but is fine for everyone else . 
smooth . not sure i 'd say soft ... .not rough though . 
there are 2 metal rails that spans the length and width of the bed ( dividing it in quarters ) . there are 26 wooden slats included , 13 for each half of the bed . they attach with some kind of plastic clips . i will be selling my slats and clips on ebay this week since i did not use them . 
it ships in pieces . it 's really quite easy to put together , especially compared to some other pieces we 've bought . it 's beautiful too . 
the side rails and foot board provided are upholstered and what the boxspring mattress sit on . not child roll off protection . you can see the footboard in the photo . both rails and foot board are lower than the mattress . 
yes , they will work in terms of size of screen . i still want to see if they hold up , without the metal ring center to avoid tearing . 
yes , they also fit my kenya bodum too . works very well 
hi ! i 'm not familiar with your press . however , when the screen is held against a flat surface it measures 151.8mm or 4.01 inches in diameter . hope this is helpful . cheers , joe . 
i do n't know . i bought mine for a french press . 
well , danny , not sure ... .did your 6 cup stainless steel coffee percolator come with a mesh screen to begin with ? ? if so , then it probably will ... .these are nice , as they are tightly woven and actually better than the screen that came with my original coffee french press . hope this helps . lauree 
no . this is an eight cup press with screens four inches in diameter=101.6 mm based on an internet conversion table . 
yes , tried & tested . thanks for your interest ! team idylc homes 
hi kent , thanks for your interest , but i would not advise to use an oversize filter screen for a smaller diameter french press . the strategic folds & impressions in the screen will not be utilized effectively to keep the grounds out completely . i am not familiar with that size french press so can not make any suggestions . sorry , best of luck in finding what you need = ) team idylc homes 
not true . the cage that covers the blades has a screw at the bottom which opens it up so the blades can be cleaned . 
it tilts forward and back about 20 degrees but is very flexible to adjust . this fan is incredibly quiet , easy to maintain but most importantly it is beautiful . 
110v ac . regular wall outlet . great fan . 
try your local hardware store . 
i have no idea 
no there is no remote , but it is the best side table fan i 've ever owned . worth every penny spent ! 
it is plug in only 
no - the power switch is in the base . 
china . but the construction and materials are very good . 
i have 2 and have n't had this problem yet . maybe you should return it , 
it 's a giant pencil sharpener .. if you want to sharpen your finger , i am sure it would do a bloody good job ! btw : love this product ! 
dear crystal m. of course it is ! however as a user and lover of the product first ( and not pers as a seller ) even though it 's dishwasher safe , i would recommend you to use one of the two brushes to clean the blades before you put it into the dishwasher . from my own experience this takes about 10 seconds and you just want to be sure nothings stays stuck between the blades due to hygienic reasons . my first spiral slicer had no brush , or whatsoever . and when i tried to use it the second time , i saw all this old vegetable parts between the blades which started to mold . very unappetising . i hope this answers your question . you get two free brushes to make sure this will not happen to you . kind regards , all times finest 
yes , if the beet is large enough . there is a device that comes with it that you can push the vegetable down into the slicer . it works on carrots , etc . 
hi sanibelle , i 've never used the gefu . this is the first spiralizer we have ever used owned . we are really happy with it . we use it multiple times a week . we regularly use it to make zucchini noodles and sweet potato mac and cheese . i have also used it with regular baking potatoes . i highly recommend it ! great value and quality . -monica 
instead of the end caps being black , one is red and one is green . they are `` protective '' caps so your fingers do n't get to the blade . you remove the caps to use the slicer . 
a small one at the end that is cone shaped . it really does n't waste very much of the vegetable . 
the dimensions are wrong ! ! more like 3.0 x 3.0 x 5.0 inches . weight should be correct . this is a high quality product that works well . definitely turns zucchini into spaghetti .fun to use , fun to eat ! ! 
i 've used a large zucchini in the opening and it was fine . the unit is really well made and sturdy . i 'd say it can accomodate a veggie as large as two to three inches around . 
ther are two handles , hold one with your left hand and hold the whole zuchinni with the other hand and twist it . you can do small spirals or larger one depending on the side you choose . i hope this helps ! i love mine.. 
dear zaphod , i am sorry to notify you that our engineer was not able to make the new cap . reason before , we are searching for the right balans between the plastic and stainless steel . we are working on several aspects of the design and hope to release it anytime soon . but whenever it is ready , you do not have to worry about it . just send us an email with your order-id , and whenever we are ready i will send you one out free of charge . please let me know if this answer satisfies you or if i need to to elaborate anything else . kind regards , all times finest 
china 
they are half a centimeter wide 
8 1 2 but that includes the bent part . 
not at all , just too small for my needs 
yes 
it 's narrower than ur regular plastic straw . i would say do n't get it if u plan to use for thick smoothies . read my review . 
there are 4 straws in the package along with a brush for cleaning . 
stainless steel 
the original box does not list the grade of stainless steel used in construction . possibly someone from basily could answer that for you . 
stainless steel . diameter is about 0.5 cm . all were bent . 
very easy to wash ! 
i bought 2 sets of these . each `` leaf '' measures 7 1 2 '' x 6 3 4 '' . it should have been listed as cm . instead of in . 
yes , need to have some water to stick to smooth surface 
yes , it does . that is the beauty . it indicates that it keeps the beverage chillingly refreshing . 
hello ashley , the mug is not just for moscow mules . you certainly will enjoy your drink in this moscow mule copper mug but at the same time you can enjoy beer , vodka and other favorite beverages . i avoid hot ones like coffee or tea . iced tea is fine . thank you for asking . 
i 'm not sure , just give it a try it ca n't hurt right . enjoy 
http : gomoscowmule.com how-to-clean-your-copper-mug-and-keep-it-as-new 
i do n't think so . you could try but it may ruin the cup 
there is no stamp on the mug or the box to say where it is made . it is of extremely nice quality . 
it is one mug . 
lisa , thank you for the question . for this mug we are not planning a hammered mug version . but soon we will be introducing 100 % copper hammered mug . 
do n't remember for certain but think they 're made in usa . they are a very good quality i can assure you . i really am pleased with them . 
i believe it is lined in stainless steel . i have not noticed any affect on taste . 
this is a 7 lb blanket .. shipping to some states cost around $ 20 and some states will be as low as $ 13 .. so its less than the average cost.. thank you 
no actualy it did n't come with pillow case and i do n't have it now.. thank you 
its purple.. thank you for asking.. 
hi mary , most nut milk bags listed on amazon are not made domestically . this is a top quality nut milk bag made with sturdy , long lasting nylon that is food grade quality and fda certified . we have been actively searching for a nut milk bag that is domestically made with the same quality as this one but have not yet found one that meets our high standards . our aim is to offer the very best quality products available at a reasonable price . we will update our product listing as soon as we find a suitable nut milk bag that is domestically made . 
if you mean , how much fluid can this bag hold before it overflows , i would guess about four cups . i make six cups of nut milk at a time . i hold this bag over an eight-cup measuring cup and pour until the bag starts to clog , then i keep pouring and squeeze gently to filter the rest of the nut milk . 
~no , only almonds for almond milk . 
yes . our deluxe nut milk bag comes with a lifetime money back satisfaction guarantee . 
one pass should do the job . it is best to blend the nuts in a high speed blender ( highest speed ) for about 2 minutes before straining . 
yes 
i 've just checked the box . it does not mention whether it is or it is n't . there 's no writing on the box to list ingredients , etc . when the box arrived there was no paperwork inside the box either . the outside of the box is really very plain and does not say much about the product . if i had encountered this in a store , i would have left it on the shelf . unless you can contact the manufacturer you are not going to find out if it is bpa free . i 'm sorry . 
yes , i have a gas grill.you need the triangle cover over the heat elements . i cleaned my grill , lined it with foil . hasnt gotten dirty all year . love the product . 
it comes with a black grill mat and a cream baking mat , but they both can be used on the grill . we use both of ours on the grill and have had no problems . 
the product is made of a flexible teflon and is labeled ptfe ( pfoa free ) see this website for explanation of ptfe pfoa http : home.howstuffworks.com nonstick-cookware5.htm . package directions advise not to use above 500f ( 260c ) . after you read the article at the website you can decide if the material releases chemicals . we usually slow cook at from 300-350f . the mat cleans very easily . hope this answers you questions . 
yes you can get your grill marks etc. , everything we grill gets done just like before , but a smidge better because the juices , marinades stay with the food and the occasional `` grease flames '' do not occur 
this mat is actually made of teflon . have you thought about using cast iron pans ? http : www.komonews.com news consumer yoshi-grill-mat-does-it-work-265637601.html ? mobile=y 
13-15 1 2 inches 
before 
i have the mat on while it 's preheating , and it 's all hot when i 'm ready to cook . 
that is what i recieved . i kept one package and sent one to my dad for father 's day . : - ) 
ive been using mine solid everyday multiple times a day for about three months . i make water for friends and i do olive oil . the oil process is slow and the machine is n't the most powerful , so you really can only produce a small amount of oil in about 3 weeks . that 's if you do it one hour a day and keep it in the fridge between running ozone through it ... and very little oil at that , about an ounce to be able to produce the desired finished product . it does come with 3 stones . two for water and one for oil . the stones seem well intacted still but about a month ago i bought a flat stone with a higher surface area and finer micron . more bubbles= more ozone . and use a single glass of water under setting 5 ( 20 minutes ) and use ice water , that 's been filtered already for the best results . water can only absorb a certain amount of ozone and is only effective for about 20 minutes after you make it . so the machine will give you one glass an hour because it needs to be turned off for double the time you just ran it for before running it again ... .. also ... i 've researched its best to drink the water a couple times a day for three days , and then take a few days off so your body can remove the pathogens your trying to . also it 's key to take vitamins in your days your not drinking the water because ozone will deplete your cells of some valuable things as well . i found that vitamin c , d3 , e , niacin , fish oil coconut oil , garlic , goldenseal , echaenatia , and those types of supplements give your cells back what they need , help you to absorb them and also work as additional antitoxins . a one a day vitamin may be sufficient , i do n't know , the above mentioned list is the recipe that i 've come to so far as i learn more and more about how to do it properly . also you do n't want to eat or take supplement within two hours of drinking the water . for instance , vitamin c and ozone cancel eachother out if taken at the same time , but if you take vitamin c a few hours after drinking a glass it makes vitamin c go nuts and can wipe out a nasty cold or flu in literally one application ... i 've read plenty of people saying they drink up to five glasses a day everyday and take no supplements but i do n't know about all that ... but i would do a little research and consider several views before getting into it ... and i 'm not saying that everything i 've just written is right , or most effective , but there is countless hours of research i 've done to get that far and i 'm sure i 've much to learn . this is a little more than you asked for , and if you are anything like i was , being new to ozone , there 's a lot more to it then just drinking a glass of water ! but in a short answer , the machine works great for personal use and comes ready to go . does n't have the power your gon na want later if you stick with it , but it 's a safe place to start . i 've since ordered a larger multipurpose that 's due any day and plan on given that one to a friend ... also beware of .gov site , american cancer research sites , fda site as they mislabel , dismiss ozone validity , confuse , and make the whole ozone thing seem dangerous or inconclusive ... there is no money in it for these institutions , meaning the money is in the treatment not the cure and is why they wo n't recognize , inform , or offer ozone treatment . trust blogs from people all over the world that are willing to share their experience ... . it saved my life . trust that . word man , good luck 
that is what i use it for almost exclusively - it 's great . i set for 10 minutes , i keep the ozone ball no more than 4 inches deep in the water ( as suggested on the pamphlet ) and i move it around the tub of veggies . i have never gotten ill and i live in south america where the parasites are different than the ones in the us so are hard on my body . have not had parasites since i have been using this . i highly recommend it . 
i 've had the same problem with this product . the problem i 've found out is that the plates inside the unit that make the ozone need to be recharged periodically to continue to make ozone and this product does not have a way to send the plates back to be recharged so when it 's no longer making ozone you 've got a rather expensive thing on your hands that does nothing . the company needs to remake the unit so the plates can be removed and sent back to be recharged in a way that is cost effective . i 've got 3 of these . the first ran for a long time , the second quit making ozone after only a couple of months and another i bought on ebay that was used and lasted a few months as well . i 'm trying to find a manufacturer that makes a unit that lasts or allows recharging . this is the coronal discharge type of ozone machine and perhaps the one that makes it with a uv light would last longer . i may try that next if i find one for a reasonable price . if your problem is that it no longer discharges ozone , otherwise , it may just be some physical defect in the machinery . 
the gray stone will ozone water , air , and oil . while the white stones are only for water and air . 
here is what the manual reads : power input : 110 vac 50 60hz ( 10w ) or 220 240 vac 50 60 hz ( 12w ) . the unit will come with either 110 vac or 220 240 vac . you just need to specify which one you want . 
i would , that 's what it 's for . 
the ozone dissolves in the water , the colder the water the more ozone dissolves 
i think i understand what you 're trying to do here . i drink lemon water in the morning too , very refreshing and healthful . you 're trying to combine two drinks into one . in this case , however , i do n't think it will work . ozone is a highly reactive gas ( i 'm not a professional chemist this is just what i 've read ) that 's why it is used to sterilize things ( like plastic where heat ca n't be used ) . i think the o3 might destroy the healthful benefits of the lemon and destroy itself in the process . i 've always read that you should take o3 water on an empty stomach and then not eat for at least 30 min lest the food in your stomach destroy the o3 , this is the procedure i use ( i 'm not a health professional this is just personal experience ) . 
the manual says two minutes . i just do a half gallon for ten and put it in the fridge . i usually finish that in two days . 
yes it will do a very good job . i did my house no more smoke oder 
master plumber came and installed my humidifier . i asked him the same question you have for me . he said that you will go through a few more filters a year , but not substantial . he also said that that is a good thing because the dirt the filter is catching would be in your house otherwise . the reason is now that you have a higher humidity % in your house the dirt sticks better to the filter and is cleaning your household air better . i agree after one day . the air just breathes clean . hope this helps and i am satisfied with my unit . 
http : docs.electronicaircleaners.com aprilaire_700a_installation.pdf looks like 14 3 4 x 14 5 16 
i checked mine monthly and used judgement on calcium build-up . a lot depends on hardness of your water . i never used more than two per season but , only ran it for 6 months per year since i live in the northeast ( another factor to consider ) . 
if you use the schematic listed for `` automatic '' operation ( i.e . intercept the `` g '' wire between the thermostat and the furnace , putting the new humidistat in between ) then this unit will be able to use the furnace blower without firing the furnace . tapping into the hot water supply ( instead of cold ) is recommended if you use this feature . my 700 is installed this way and works very well in this configuration . 
mine is installed on the supply side . i left as much space as possible between it and the ac coil . i spoke to a few hvac pros and they recommended to keep it on the supply side rather than on the return side using hot water this is a drip design and uses a fair bit of water meaning a lot of extra cost if hot water is used . additionally the return side is cool air which ca n't carry as much moisture as warm air can . install on the supply side with cold water ; you 'll be fine . my home is 3800 sqft and this unit keeps the set humidity level all winter long with no issue . 
warranty is for 5 years for parts , but not labor . no mention of licensed hvac installer in my owner 's manual . 
wow ! i 'm pricing out whole central a c and heating unit installations and one of my bidders charges $ 495 for this option installed ( and that 's in high-priced dc area ) . 
not really . you will have to buy additional items such as : drainage tube , water supply hookup tubing , duct sealant tape . it does come with a water supply saddle . all stuff you can pick up at home depot after you get the unit . the humidifier has worked great for for me ! 
if you 're going to a model 700a the control wiring must be completely re-done including installing a temperature sensor on an exterior outside wall . the 760 model operates using an internal 24vac transformer and operates when the circuit between the external brown leads from the humidifier is closed . the new model 760a ( gray color housing ) uses and external 24vac transformer ( supplied ) and operates when the control circuit applies 24vac to the 2 external brown wires . the wiring diagram is included with the 760a and humidistat control . 
the fan draws air from within the duct through the moist evaporator panel and back into the duct . there is no room air pulled in through this action . 
yes 
you have to set the timer each time that you use it . 
you can set 3 separate times on the timer . each timer is separate , so you can have one going off in 10 min then another going off in 1 min the another going off in 15 minutes . great timer for multiple dishes . hope this helps . sally 
the description says `` two lr44 batteries '' . amazon carries several options ( of course ) , but here 's one that looks pretty good : http : www.amazon.com pack-maxell-ag13-button-battery dp b001fdojcq ref=sr_1_2 ? s=electronics & ie=utf8 & qid=1405996899 & sr=1-2 & keywords=lr44+batteries 
eventually , i think it shuts off after a minute of beeping . 
yes you can by taking advantage of the fact that the device actually has 4 individual timers . you would set timer 1 at 4 hours , timer 2 at 8 hours , and timer 3 at 12 hours . 
probably 
nope . i just took it out and pressed a bunch of buttons and it does n't glow light up ... why are you cooking in the dark.. 
nope , you just need to hold down the `` clock '' button for a few seconds . hope that helps 
yes 
hmmm , no definitive answer on that . i 've slept on a futon so i know what you 're talking about . i 'm on a seraphina 14 inch gel foam mattress so i 'm super comfy . my inclination would be to add a foam gel topper to your futon over this product . 
it 's the same fabric as traditional box springs . it 's a tight fit and challenging to get centered but it works well once you get it on there . 
yes 
80 '' 60 '' 
if i understand your question correctly , the foundation would rest on the side rails that currently support your slats . or , you could just rest this foundation on top of the 5 slats you currently have . i have a regular metal bed frame , which has side rails about 1 1 2 '' wide upon which the foundation rests . it is quite secure and fits well . 
no unless you . have termites in your home in the walls are infested with termites but no it that would be the same thing as if you had a wooden chair wooden table or a wooden spoon no honey you 're not going to get any termites in your bed it 's a great product and it works wonderfully 
a socket wrench or adjustable wrench and a philips head screw driver . 
yes 
yes 
tough to answer without seeing the edge , but if you have 2 '' or so it should work , the edge of the wooden box spring is quite strong . in fact i sit on the edge of my mattress each morning talking to my wife and i weigh about 180 lbs . 
the 'twist test ' does not test for fillers . silicone is naturally white . to verify it has fillers , you have to burn the product and see if you get white ( pure ) or black ( not pure ) ashes . the white you can see on various silicone products has to do with the vulcanization process of putting color into the silicone . if the product uses an fda process , you can see the white . if you use the lgfb process ( that europe uses ) , you will not see white . lgfb processing costs about 20 % more than fda , so you 'll pay more if you do n't want to see white . 
i measured about 3.75 fluid ounces for each one . i 'd plan for 3.5 , so with 6 ice pops , that will make 21 ounces . 
7 3 4 inches long ; 19 cm . long -- 2 n1 2 inches wide at top ; 6 cm . wide at top , tapering to 11 2 inches 3 12 cm . at bottom . they 're tricky to store . i have mine in the drawer with my silverware . 
these ice pop molds can withstand temperatures up to 450 f because they are fda approved silicone material . they should not touch an open flame or burner though . 
ive only had them since june 26 or 27th , 2014. so far i havent had any of the issues you 've asked . they are very well made . no stains , no leaks & no odors . but i am purchasing more w 50 % off coupon im receiving for the order 
yes , i always freeze them on their sides . 
i received an email that gave me the link to the e-book . 
it says made in china on the box . all 100 % silicone products do not have bpa . you can only find bpa in plastics . bpa is a chemical they put into plastics when trying to make it soft ( e.g . baby bottle nipple ) . silicone is naturally flexible , so it does not need it . that 's why silicone is so popular . 
i put them in my kids lunches and they have not leaked . i also put them in a zip lock bag just in case - i have 1 in kindergarten , so who knows what it goes through in the classroom . just make sure you leave about 1 2 to 1 inch in the top because liquids expand when they freeze . 
thanks for your question . our peelers are indeed dishwasher safe and can be run in a normal cycle , but most of our customers do n't really even need to send it through a full cycle . most are doing a fine job cleaning it by simply using warm water and a soft brush . one thing you should not do is use a hard , abrasive brush or cleaner such as steel wool because that would ruin the finish . additionally , if you have well water or hard water , it is suggested to wash by hand and dry fully . hardwater contains excess iron which may cause rust on stainless steel objects when left wet and exposed to air . 
thank you for your question . our customers and we at uberchef have julienned zuchinni , carrots , potatoes , sweet potatoes , butternut squash , celery , cucumber , applies , kiwi , and a whole lot more : ) test out our julienne peeler and let us know what your results are and what fruits veggies you 've used it on ! 
thanks for your question . the usable portion of the julienne side is just a hair over 1.75 inches in width . the regular serrated side is 1.875 inches in width . and the overall width of the head is about 3.44 inches . hope this helps ! 
more like angel-hair than spaghetti 
thanks for your question . you should be able to use the julienne blade ( or the regular peeler blade for that matter ) on cheddar without issue . our peeler works best on medium and hard cheeses , as compared to softer cheeses such as fresh mozzarella , for example . i hope this helps ! 
hi barney , thanks for your question . though our peeler can tackle many projects , a pineapple is probably not a good one to try . the skin on a pineapple is likely far too thick for either of the blades to cut through . 
absolutely ! try making a nice mango slaw with it . a new way to enjoy one of my favorite fruits : ) best , ellyn co-founder 
yes . one side is a traditional peeling blade . the other side makes julienne . both work perfectly . 
i 've personally never tried it on a green plantain , however , i have tried it on an orange , green bell pepper , an unripe banana and of course the typical fruits and veggies you 'd peel with a peeler . this is the real deal . i love it ! 
it did not come with a video but did come with info and a web address to a video and additional info 
one of the nice things about this edgestar unit is the entire unit will shut off when the selected humidity level is reached . most comparable unit 's fan will keep running and only the compressor will shut on off . the edgestar shuts all the way off making it less noisy than other models . 
before you deal with any company for a dehumidifier , look up their history with recalls based on fire hazards . 
yes it does and it works perfectly . 
i did and it was n't a problem 
as you face the machine , it will come out of the right side . mine actually blows toward some house plants i have and they have benefited from it . btw i run this 24 7 and it performs like a champ ! i have mine draining into a 5 gal bucket and i ca n't believe all the water it removes from the air in the house ... great for here in damp oregon . regards , jwm 
all i could find is edgestar and koldfront brands are made for living direct , inc. you can get more information including contact phone numbers at edgestar.com . 
it is 110 115 volts 60 hz only . 
i think i purchased an extended warranty through square trade . 
the hose is not included ; however , there is a place to attach one . i know my sister used hers in he basement of her home and just ran the hose down the drain in the basement . i just empty mine by hand . 
the unit needs to be higher than the drain initialy -- -once it starts draining thru the hose , the unit can then be set on the same level as the drain 
yes . it works great for making almond milk . much better than the cheese cloth i was using 
yes and it works great 
there is a link on the paperwork that comes with the bag that gives you the e-book . it is quite easy and there are tons of recipes on the web as well . 
no 
quite a few . my guess as someone who has one that it is about 10 cups probably . it is good sized . 
i do n't know about soy bean milk but have used it to strain hot soup and make coconut milk using dried coconut and very hot water . you just had to be careful to let the bag cool before trying to squeeze it . ouch . 
it is made in china . 
that 's what i bought this for , and it works great ! 
i would use a strainer to remove the kefir grains rather than a nut bag 
yes it would be perfect 
just stick the food in and turn , stainless steel blades spiral cut as you turn , just like sharpening a pencil except bigger . 
the box says china . 
the ebook comes in an email from the seller . usually arrives a day after you get the slicer . if you do not get that email , contact the seller and they will resend the email . 
it has 2 sizes . 
i 've put in in the top rack -- but you really need to use the brush that comes with it , even so . lots of little nooks to get clean . i hope this helps . 
the slicer , the top and a cleaning tool . the cook books are e-books . 
to me they dont look either or..they are more square than flat or round . definitely not round spaghetti style 
about two inches is `` wasted '' . it comes to a point where you can no longer grip the item with hands or the tool . it is n't a waste really if you dice the remainder . 
steam , saute , eat raw -- this is just a novel way to slice vegetables . the skinny strips , sauteed with a little oil , maybe , are great in place of pasta with tomato sauce . 
it is not awkward at all to use . the silver handles on the side are thin so it will be challenging to get a good grip on the slicer unless your grip is fairly strong . i have n't seen anything similar with wider grips for individuals with ra . 
it slices very thin -is perfect for making crisps . it will slice soft fruit and veg beautifully as the blade is very sharp . 
it 's not adjustable for thick and thin slices , but in my opinion , as it is really more convenient to use than the more complicated and more expensive adjustable mandolines , as there 's no setup and easy to clean . so it 's great for those quick jobs making homemade potato etc . 
after using this mandolin on cucumbers and onions , i think you would get a really thin ribbon of zucchini . i believe it would cut the zucchini just fine , but it would n't be very thick . 
it should work fine with hard raw veggies , but because they will need a little extra pressure , you will want to place the mandoline on top of a bowl so both ends have some support . the mandoline is very thin and bends easily . 
that is correct . it only slices in paper-thin slices . 
hello npat , free ebooks will be send to you next day after the date shipped . hope this help : - ) 
depends on what you put as the sliding handle 
https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=zp4z_gp3a6k 
i do n't know because i returned this . it was flimsy and dangerous to use , and had a single stationary blade that sliced paper-thin . 
hello thomas , with our mandoline you only receive bonus knife and 3 free ebooks . we mention in our main title that tominco mandoline has `` longer life than traditional mandolines , spiral , spiralizer and vegetable chopper ... '' . it 's only statement that our product has longer life than traditional spiralizer ... . hope this help : - ) 
as is , no ! there were no provisions for tubing or anything else that might be needed for a continuous drain . 
no provision for a wall mount . so no . 
not knowing the sq ft of your sun room and the rh in it , hard to say if it will stop it completely . but it will help - by pulling out some of the excess moisture there will be less available to condensate on the windows . 
as a dehumidifier it is a nice medium sized unit . as far as an odor product maybe leave out some air freshness that just work off of water like the kind with the mini scent balls . 
it is a small hole . 
i can hardly hear it running . its whispers . ( quiet ) . i have to feel the sides to see if it 's still running . 
no , tank has to be in unit to operate and drain plug is in top of tank so not sure how you could make it self drain . tank fits very smug with no room to add drain tube . hope this helps you . 
read my one star comment and cry ! well maybe yiu can still return it for a refund as i could n't ! cheers 
yes 
no 
no . it is 100 % stainless steel . the mesh is held by 2 metal plates and extends out about 1 4 '' , which is then pushed against the inside of the wall by a sspring to create a seal . 
i use it to make a single cup a day . 
not sure about replacement parts . the inside is insulated brush metal , same as the outside . i 'm quite pleased with the quality . definitely would recommend it . 
it does n't look like that would be a good idea . it seems that i read that should n't be done in the directions sent with the unit . 
top is hollow ... but i would n't recommend this product . while i have had no problems with the lid , i get coffee grounds when i pour because the screen is n't functioning properly . i have tried to locate a new screen but have n't been able to . amazon does n't carry it and the generic ones do n't fit . 
unknown , but it notes it should not be used on a stovetop ( at all ) . as the air chamber providing insulation is sealed , heating the entire unit would be both a ) ineffective for hearing the contents , as there is a barrier of air between the metal and the contents , and b ) dangerous , as heating the contents enough to boil water is beyond the likely design specs -- - but i 'm not an expert . even so , if you 're able to heat the contents via induction , it still seems to involve boiling inside the pot which would rise over the boiling point ( for the captured steam prior to release ) and beyond the capabilities of the product ? 
sure , but a bit tall . i 've washed it on the bottom rack several times and it appears 100 % fine . it 's double walled , but all stainless , so the minor air pressure compared to the strong cold steel is to little if any effect . go for it on the bottom rack . 
i have the same problem ... i have to use pliers to grip the stem , then twist off the strainer ... i 've also been unable to find a replacement strainer ... bottom line , this is a lousy product ... 
made in china . 
i could n't say . for the one i received there was nothing on the packaging , in the packaging or on the press itself that said where it was made . 
yes but it 's not a complete seal , there 's a slight gap at the mouth of the press . 
i would suggest the importer of the pot itself . 
i do n't know for sure but i did look at my older bodem press & its filter looks to be the same size . i would check bed bath & beyond , sur le tabla , or william sonoma ? i 've only had mine about 2 months now so have n't needed to replace mine yet . let me know if any of these work . thanks rick 
it appears to be a millimeter of two larger in diameter than my bodum french press . i had the same thought , to maybe just use the parts from my old press , but unfortunately they are just slightly smaller and do n't work . 
yes , and it keeps it warm for quite a while too . 
it should n't taste bad but would not be as hot . we brew one and put that in a thermos , and then another which gets consumed within 15 minutes . any late morning coffee left over usually gets zapped in the microwave and tastes much better than something that 's been sitting on a heating element . 
no it does not -- and for a reason -- if you press or `` squeeze '' the grinds it will release a more acidic and very bold tasting brew which is often also quite bitter depending on how dark the beans your using are roasted . so the couple of ounces your trying to squeeze out is best used for your flowers ! -- they 'll respond in glorious fashion ! ! 
yes . its totally stainless & there are no plastic parts . i have been enjoying mine ! 
yes 
you do not plug this in ; you fill with hot water to steep the coffee to make a french press carafe of coffee 
it is recommended that they not be placed in the dishwasher . however , i have accidently put them in once or twice without a problem . i do n't know how they would fare with daily washing . 
the box says hand wash , so that is what i have done . sorry , i do not know if they are top rack ok in dishwasher 
i think they 're 8oz 
we wanted to clear up some dimensional information - so thanks elizabeth for asking . with the top on and locked the strainer is 2 inches in diameter at its widest point and just over 2 inches tall . it holds 5 teaspoons of tea , but we recommend using 1 tablespoon ( 3 teaspoons ) of tea to get great flavor and allow the tea to fully expand . hope that helps , don ( schefs ) 
mish - the infuser is designed to work with most leaf teas . some teas contain that contain small particles will have debris . these types of teas include rooibos , some herbals or spiced teas that have small particles or spices ( for example cinnamon spiced teas ) , and ground or fine teas that are not whole leaf . often organic teas fall into the last category and can cause problems . finally some smoked teas can cause problems if the leaves are brittle and have broken into small pieces . i hope that helps . of course we offer a full `` no questions asked '' refund - so you can buy with confidence knowing that if it does not work for you we will provide you a full refund . thanks , don ( co-founder schefs ) 
d , we designed and developed the specifications here in the us and it is manufactured to those high standards in china . each item is shipped to our site here in the us , inspected , packaged , and then sent to amazon fulfillment . don ( co-founder schefs ) 
it has a nice , tight seal and i would say yes , if it is big enough for the size batch you are doing . the size is about 1.5 inches diameter across the top and then sloping in slightly to the bottom which has diameter of 1.25 inches . the height is about 1.5 inches . 
bill - it can hold up to 5 teaspoons - but i do not think that is enough to really flavor a full pitcher of tea . it is designed for a single cup ( including a large mug travel mug ) . 
yes it is stainless steel - 304 grade ( 18 8 ) . the first number,18 , refers to the amount of chromium present and the second represents the amount of nickel . 304 grade can have 18-20 % chromium and 8 % nickel . it is the most common stainless steel used in the food prep kitchen utensil market . hope that helps , don ( co-founder schefs ) 
sorry , no . it makes one really strong cup of tea or two `` normal '' strength . 
the tea infuser itself is not magnetic . 
aprox . 2.5 inches 
j. richardson - we have had a few ask this or a similar question - but no feedback yet . if you would like to experiment with it we would be happy to offer you a full refund if it does n't work . thanks , don
