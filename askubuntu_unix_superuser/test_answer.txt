gautam yep . when i shut down and restart , then no problem . if i restart directly , then no wifi .
thank you ! ~ robert
yes it is a laptop , with nvidia optimus
thanks ! the output is not a qasm file . the author want to use python to do what the latex package qasm2circ can do .
do you mean synaptic package manager ( sudo apt-get install synaptic ) or did you mean aptitude ? i tried sudo apt-get install aptitude but it failed because of dependency issues . `` depends : libcwidget3 but it is not going to be installed depends : libept1.4.12 but it is not going to be installed recommends : libparse-debianchangelog-perl but it is not going to be installed '' is what it says about sudo apt-get install aptitude
once i boot into live cd , the wireless networking is n't enabled and asks me to install a broadcom driver , with a lan card image .
yes please i would like some support
yes i have updated it @ avinash raj
-- the documentation here appears to suggest it does , and should show up even if the menu is hidden .
my pc instantly resumes from suspend on ubuntu 15.10. and i want it to suspend when i shut it off and stay in suspend mode .
it asks me whether to install the following additional packages : `linux-headers-4.2.0-34 linux-headers-4.2.0-34-generic` and the following new packages `linux-headers-4.2.0-34 linux-headers-4.2.0-34-generic linux-headers-generic` . edit : one of the errors says to `` specify kern_dir= '' . is there a way to do this , i.e . to point it to the 3.16 kernel packages ?
agreed . i have formatted the partition and reinstalled ubuntu - i used netext'73 because of a small visual glitch with the drivers i installed via the additional drivers app , but i guess i 'd rather small flashes and crashes rather than a completely unusable system .
oops , thanks , fixed . i ca n't remember for certain the original state , but i just went into parted and deleted everything i could see . parted still reports the whole thing at 2tb . pasting the output into my original question .
i checked syslog in a terminal straight after it logged out and there is no error about not being able to shut down .
internet , the virtual machine has no problem with the ethernet .
yes , i use putty . i updated the post with some logs
libnotify not working
yeah one can get both bands , so i connect that one to 5ghz ssid and other one to 2.4ghz ssid . and i seek the settings by which the os can transfer data using bandwidth earned by two adapters simultaneously and increase my transfer speed from router attached storage to my laptop .
it is 500 gb and divided into two
pretty much all updates including the user repositories as well .
black screen with grub > prompt
no problem , added output of file command .
disabling the wifi and connecting to ethernet worked ! what is the problem in my case ?
the output is `-sh` , i assume i am using bash because i am using the same terminal and login method as i do for root whose profile works fine
eth0 is set by the exit hook . that will run some code to add an address to eth0 there is no dhcp server on eth2 for ipv6 prefix , only comcast can hand me my prefix .
everything is normal but there are a couple lines that talk about the gpu issue . for example at the top it says : `starting bumblebee supporting nvidia optimus cards [ fail ] ` then a bunch of [ ok ] s and further down it says `no suitable module for kernel found [ fail ] ` and the last one further down after a few [ ok ] s says `starting load fallback graphics devices [ fail ] ` sorry if this does n't help , i was n't sure what to write exactly
i updated , but what fdisk -1 will do ?
i got fallowing error
sorry chili555 . no such file or directory .
all the apps have this behavior on my machine ( i do n't say that it 's a good computer , but windows 7 was very fast on it ) . after one year of ubuntu experience i decided to ask this . for example `chromium-browser` , but even `vim` does same thing ( about 5 seconds at first start ) .
yes i am sure it is a 256gb ssd . i replaced it with a 500gb ssd , and am attempting to replace an older laptops hard drive with my 256gb ssd .
yes `connection available to all` is already ticked . the non-admin user can connect to a pre-established connection without issue ( e.g . home wifi say ) , the problem is when they try to connect to a genuinely new wifi network ( say at a cafe or hotel ) , somewhere never previously connected to , then upon attempting to connect via `networkmanager` the non-admin user is prompted for my ( the admins ) password .
i am using 14.10 version .
actually x86_64 , ignore my previous comment that was up for a few seconds if you saw that . and yeah , i saw that thread and tried the stuff suggested in it already .
yes , exist squid3.conf . i use ubuntu server 13.1 x86
yes , that would be ok. my problem is that i do n't know if the usb boot is going to be able to work right from the phone . android phones usually have various methods to connect from usb ( as a multimedia player , as a mobile device and so on ) so i guess it is n't as easy as using it like a pendrive ? just speculating here , i have no idea , but i do n't want to screw this up
oh , it 's coming from router dhcp .
bind is an alternative option however i am using the internal dns .
i installed the nvidia driver and cuda toolkit ( because i want to use cuda ) but the example code would not run ( although it compiled ) . that is when i saw that `nvidia-smi` was not seeing the card .
edited including lsusb output from terminal @ seth
thank you for all of the responses . although i could n't get any to work , i remebered i created a second user called `` bob '' . and i could sign in . my precious server ! thank you all ! : d

`` /etc/init.d/fail2ban status '' command gives `` no such file or directory '' as output . i suspect fail2ban is not active .

thanks jonathan for the reply . here is how we run the script ; # ! /bin/sh echo `` ok , starting now ... '' ftp remotehost <
thanks zanna . i 'm pretty sure i installed the desktop version . should i try to startx command anyway ?
yes but `source` is not limited to passing variable only .
it 's not flacon , but falcon . it 's like i have to put in an account which i do n't have . i do n't know if it 's because the computer was a microsoft xp but formatted as a ubuntu . i ca n't take a picture , but it 's like : the whole screen black and then at the top on the left there are some phrases and codes . these are the codes : ubuntu 16.04.1 lts falcon tty1
using ubuntu 16.04 right now
the trouble is , that the frame rate is so low that it is impossible to use the system . that is the trouble .
if i can do so without losing all my data on my hard drive . is there no solution for 12.10 ?
good point , i somehow did n't even check that . where might that be determined ? ?
no , different ones .
yeah , fisrt installed windows , then ubuntu , then re-installed windows just to make sure if i ever needed to do that i`d be ok , but now windows loads directly , no menu from ubuntu
hy gertvdijk . thank you for your answer . i am simply trying to achieve to encrypt all messages generated by the system , not every meassge that i get . if i fetch my messages via imap , i want them to be encrypted . i am aware , that i can not keep my messages `` safe '' in case of a brake in , but i do n't want them to be sent via tls as `` plain text '' over the internet . no , i am using exim4 , with famd and courier . kind regards .
thanks , i changed back as you suggested but it is still the same as before . is this becoz of updating or i did select amd/ati as my graphic option rather than the open source one . but when i did execute the amdconfig command it did say no such device found
thanks for the help . screenshot - /home/ted/pictures/screenshot from 2016-03-12 17:00:46.png
how to check sound card details in ubuntu ?
i have cd with full iso of kubuntu 14.04
yes , and opening the volume would be nice too , but not essential .
i installed it from the website .
thanks ! yes , it does have nvidia optimus enabled and no i 'm not running bumblebee . should i try it ?
, no , it 's completely empty .
everything was setup ... still was not working ... .but let it be it is done ! thanx for the response !

haha , yeah it 's empty .
yes i ran create as root .
i use three different tools to find out the gnome version : sysinfo : 3.8.4 ; i-nex : 3.9.90 ; gnome-sessions -- version : 3.9.90. none of them points to the 3.10. what can i do to have at least the 3.10 ?
you mean dependencies such as libavcodec54 ? that does n't work either . or do you mean something else ?
it is 64 bit and i just checked the integrity and everything checks out , i 'm going to now attempt with a flash drive will post results .
that 's exactly what i 'm doing . but 10min was only the time i was away , actually it 's faster and _only_ takes the display about 1min to come back from sleep .
no at first the turned yellow and everytime i reboot they 're yellow already
**edit** my problem with the situation is , that i want the usual ssh-server setup with rsa-authentication . right now i just can login without it and cant figure out what i have to do .
opps i did n't make myself clear . it 's all in my head . as i was asking the question i forgot to bring up ubuntu.. so sorry ... but the network adapter did n't work on my ubuntu machine before had so ... . it 's more like a bonus .
4.3.10 r93012 . yep . 4.3.12 is actually out now , but when i try to update it says `` the network operation failed with the following error : unknown reason ''

correct . i was trying to follow the instructions on the website i gave but i have clearly stuffed it up haha . is there any way i can keep it and fix it ? i mean i do want it but if i have to remove it then i will .
hi , thanks for the welcome . i do n't want a persistent live usb , i want a full installation on a usb drive that boots from uefi . i managed to do a full installation of lubuntu on a usb , but it can only boot in mbr mode . i would like to do the same but booting in uefi mode .
it locks my desktop
because when prop_max_users enum is refered in the rest of the code appears `` max_users '' not `` max-users '' . and , i think , the line 1340 is filling the enum .
thank you for responding and the info you posted . my computer is rather slow and indexing in every boot will make it slower . i also noticed that `apt-xapian-index` regenerates in every boot . so problem appears to be widesprean in my system .
i forgot to add that i tried opening a few instances of a file manager to check how high frequency can go . after that i ran this script and took screenshots .
no . atm , ubuntu asks for my password saying the keyring did n't get unlocked during login , which is true , since the greeter screen just says login , but i do n't want that , i want to type my password on the greeter screen
i ended up installing mingw on my wine and it works alright . i had forgotten i had written this question . i should probably write an answer for it .
will try , but how can you explain that on windows it works fine ?
of the applications i 'm running right now it is the only one i saw it happen . and it happen only after the 15.10 upgrade .
well , it says that the update failed ... nvm , i 'm reinstalling .
i edited my question above to answer your questions .
i was sure i red that it does not support multi-trackers , but i will try now thanks
**edit : ** i ended up solving this problem by remapping windows to control and caps lock to hyper in keyboard layout . i then used ccsm to remap the unity dash key to hyper . i also remapped things like alt-tab to control-tab ( which is now physically windows-tab if you 're still following ) to get a more mac-like experience . i no longer have a windows key but after the ccsm remapping i have no use for one .
i did it by deleting everything off the linux one and then merging it with the windows one
yep , i checked and double checked , and then tried every other input source just to be on the safe side .
i plugged it into my ubuntu box , and it shows up with disk utility ( du ) . du sees the partitions , though it does n't recognize the filesystems on the partitions ; this is odd as one is fat32 . i currently have a working solution using ubuntu on virtualbox on a mac , but if i ever need to get this working with linux , i 'll try reformatting with du .

how to do that ?
that thread does seem to be very similar to my problem . however , i am a newbie on linux so i do n't know how to create the config file in /etc/pm/config.d/config . i went to that folder on my machine and tried right-clicking and selecting 'new empty document ' but that option was not allowed . how can i do this ?
edit : if it 's relevant , my /home folder is definitely encrypted .
ps : i found out that tty1 ( and *only* tty1 ) is also orange , like the cursor . why is that ? [ 1 ] :

**sudo dmidecode -s bios-version** : a05
there are no files identified as kept back . when i execute the command do-release-upgrade , it responds with `` no new release found '' .
i could not find a file there
yes . multipath is running . when i show an lsblk , it gives me all of the drive names ( sdd , sde ... ) , and even breaks it down to sdd1 , and then shows the dm-x partitions underneath it . part of this problem is that i do n't understand multipath well , and what it does . so i do n't quite know what i 'm doing here . but from what i see , all of the stuff in /dev/mapper shows up when i run lsblk .
its just for playonlinux
i did think of that but from the research i have done and questions i have asked , the general feeling i get is that this is a bad idea .
i should have said that if i remove the database server all the content that is n't loaded from the database appears . some basic html for the site construction and etc . but without the database the site is an empty shell . when i reinstall the database server it gives me the 504 error and that 's it . nothing more .

thanks for the info in your answer . etho in my question is a typo . in my /etc/network/interfaces file it is eth0 as i only changed dhcp to static on that line and then added the network addressing , etc . below . i had tried dns-nameserver at one point . i went ahead and made the dns-nameserver change and restarted but got the same error . i will take a better look at your advice against what i have already tried . to answer your question regarding hostname changes . more or less how i bind the servername to the static ip addressing . thanks for all your help .

i should also mention that the fans go crazy ( very loud compared to any laptop i have heard ) so i do n't think it is a fan control issue . laptop : acer aspire v5-571pg these problems have been here since i installed ubuntu . it was running windows very well . i had no overheating issues at all and the battery performance was 4 times as much as it is now on ubuntu .
i posted the directory permissions .
correct - if the window is behind other windows it does n't bounce out in front . np .
, i 'm using ubuntu desktop .
these are my steps i did last time : 1 ) `cd /sys/class/backlight/` 2 ) `cd acpi_video0` 3 ) `cat max_brightness` 4 ) after figuring out max brightness changing the current brightness by `sudo nano brightness` there was something that took my attention , my `max_brightness` allways decreased after i changed my brightness and it got stuck in 15 right now . i do n't why
of the others
edit : i 'm not facing a broken pipe here , i 'm facing a logged in session through a terminal ( would it be a terminal or a terminal emulator ? the server is headless so its like a terminal but i 'm not sure here ) that has output to my monitor via a vga cable and **not** an ssh session with a broken pipe

the laptop im using is asus k401ub , intel core i5 6200 , with nvidia 940m . and i just got it connected to internet using lan cable . well had to walk 2 miles for the cable .
thank you quasim , i wanted to run wps , which is a clone of ms office 2012 .
... avisynth is definitely windows only.. i 've read ( somewhere ) that there was an attempt several years ago to port it to 'nix.. ( as a multi-platorm avisnth 3.0 , i believe ) , but the developer could n't get around some of the windows specific issues that were deeply embedded in his original design . it 's a pity , becaue it is such a powerful audio/video scripted language ... . ( you can do `` almost '' anything with it ... it is a scriptable frame server , so there are no gi-normous temp files floatting around .
yes , they were connected to the same router .
**edit** : i have still the opportunity to use `ctrl+alt+t` for the terminal . and from there i used `firefox & ` to get the browser on .
no , just a lot of logs about detecting new hardware ... nothing like warning or error .
no i did not know that . according to the book , upstart is the future and systemv is dead . since i am using 14.04 , i still would like an answer to this question .
yes , but the same file works fine with windows machine
using 11.10 with thunderbird..
no i did n't , but i will post it again .
first thank you for the anwser . i have a geforce 705 gt
and @ aneeshep : i did not install maven . i also dont know how its installed . i installed eclipse few hours ago . i am not sure if it automatically installs maven . but if it is not installed then `mvn -version` should give some error message
it was legacy but i switched it to uefi and still had problems . i searched a couple of tutorials to fix the problem some involving me to put in my disc and going into terminal and doing some updates on grub . i eventually caved seeing as how i need a working computer and installed windows
i do n't even have `/etc/guest-session` directory . should i ?
: yeah . when booting i see first the ubuntu logo with a few dots under . when the dots are filled , the login screen is shown with the default background , which then fades to my personal background . i 'd like to go directly from the logo with dots to my personal background = )
no , i 'm saying if i reboot my host remotely , i want to access the session remotely that my physical display sees/shares .
no i cant select it it is grey , i have monitor with higher resolution then the cs 1.6 supports , meybe the problem is in it , i dont know , if i knew i wouldnt be asking you ...
ok , so it works . thank you .
yes , but that is not normal . i will loose the quality even more
oh , it works . i did n't know that 's what it was for . thanks !
no , i did not . where can i read about groups of packages and how do they differ from just empty packages with dependencies ?
actually all packages are behaving same but for your concern i noticed this when i installed eclipse and removed it by autoremove command..
excuse my ignorance but this is all very new to me , is the > ping 8.8.8.8 -s 100 < supposed to take all day ? it was still running after more than an hour . i control c 'd it and this is what i got from it : > -- - 8.8.8.8 ping statistics -- - 5098 packets transmitted , 1100 received , 78 % packet loss , time 5126837ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 76.027/246.096/622.414/197.174 ms
sure thanks man -- - so just for general knowledge , please , what is that `` switchdesk '' command i encountered in some forum threads in the net ? should i run it in the end ?
unless you 're referring to something i 'm confused about , yes . i changed the root user 's password using instructions i found online . it worked , because as i said above , after changing the password , i can successfully login to the text interface ( ctrl-alt-f1 ) . however , when i try to login to the graphical interface , it just blinks the screen for a split second and returns to the login screen .
but the stick does not contain that much space , can you explain why a brand new distro of ubuntu would need that much space for upgrades ?
yes its the 'plank ' . where could it have gone wrong ? when i load it back again the line comes back .
thank you both , serverus ' answer looks like the one was looking for , unfortunately i started having more issues later that day and ended up installing everything anew ( this time in my laptop 's hdd ) . i most say i 'm a little bit surprised at how fast and easy it was , now that i know what i want and where to look for it
i would like it to be a static ip all the time . i do not want the ip address to change ever .
i reinstalled it using wubi . so do you think a live cd will do the work ?
, print screen do n't save mouse pointer ...
sorry , that would have been helpful . it 's called `` sound converter '' .
my wifi adapter does n't support master / ap mode .
okay no problem , it would be nice to know how to do it with awk
i do n't know thats what i 'm trying to find out xd
thanks for everyone comment , i decide to keep ubuntu 32 bit
yes i did ( it 's called `` vmware tools '' ) . as for your other question , i am using the console and i would like to stick with it ( it works perfectly on ubuntu 8.04 ) . i might try rdp in the future but i would like to solve the problem first for the console .
edit : **os** : kubuntu 9.10. installed gnome packages for ubuntu and use those . upgraded to 10.04 . 64bit nvidia proprietary video drivers using the restricted driver tool . **hardware** : core 2 quad 4gb ddr2 667 ram 7200rpm hdd nvidia geforce 8800 also note for everyone responding : the default settings work damn well in windows on the same machine . the performance in linux is what sucks .
hm , as far as i know , this is now called `` system settings '' . there is the sub menu `` desktop behavior '' . under `` activities '' , i find `` default '' , and `` '' desktop '' items . `` remember the current desktop virtual desktop for each activity ( needs restart ) '' is active . ( unsure whether this helps . )
hmmm ... i 've only tried it out with compiz .
ubuntu 16.04 lts : i think i must have deleted it somehow with a pc - cleaner ...
it was an driver for uvc-camera
is it possible to create a regular user account with limited access ? this user should n't be able to delete files and add or copy new files .
i tried the driver suggested here , but unfortunately no improvement with this driver , the pages are slow to load , and the download rate is 200 ~ 300kbps in windows it was 1.0 ~ 1.1mbps
, not a silly question . made a silly typo in my install file . it 's a school assignment so not home use but also not made for distribution . now the usr/lib folder is created at installation . searched for a day after that fault . thank you
ftp server does not publish over lan
that is exactly what i have done and it is not working , i can not download pulg-in which i want

i see , it means that wifi is disabled by hardware , the wifi light is red , but i do n't know why . pressing on the button makes no difference . is it broken ? other devices can see the networks . [ rfkill list all ] ( `sudo modprobe ... ` produces no output . i did `rfkill unblock all` , to no avail .
no i did n't
ther is my boot script , sorry but some words are in spanish because my ubuntu is in spanish . not using wubi , ubuntu has its own partition , 64-bits , and matlab 2011a has very low performace compared to windows version .
version 15.04 , exactly the same as before . the old installation was 3 or 4 years old . apparently a fresh install is not the same as one that has been updated from an older install .
- here is the output of apt-cache policy debconf : installed : 1.5.28ubuntu4 candidate : 1.5.28ubuntu4 version table : *** 1.5.28ubuntu4 0 500 lucid/main packages 100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
that 's the issue . no , it is not a usb adapter , it is built-in .
yeah , i saw that option . but , what i need is that when i start the ubuntu one app , i should n't have to look for that option again to reconnect . it should like , remember its settings before i quit it , so that when i restart it again , it will just sync and connect , and everything . but when i quit it , it should also close all related processes to it . i also have dropbox installed but i also do n't run it all the time , only when i need to sync some new files . but when i quit dropbox , i do n't see any left-over background processes . ubuntu one was already like this in 11.10 .
fixed the links ( someone fixed the first two and broke the second two ) and added bitdefender .
there is no system setting - > wacom tablet ( probably half the problem ) . i have xserver-xorg-inout-wacom , libwacom2 , libwacom-common , libwacom-bin packages installed .
hi jo-erland schinstad ... i was playing around with banshee trying to get access to my music on laptop which runs vista ... i finally got it too work then i rebooted and as the machine was going through the reboot i noticed that the files i had on my desktop , were all gone and that my desktop was empty . on reboot it turns out that all of the files i had on my desktop were indeed gone and my trash was empty since i had emptied it before i rebooted . that is when i cast around to see if i could recover one file in particular , my notes , but to no avail ... i did have a backup from 11/8/2011 .
yes , every time .
ha , nothing much . just lazy i suppose ! ( more steps ... although generally i do have a terminal open )
i explored the list i have wrote right now ( except the .desktop files ) and found no reference to the program .

when i once again try booting from bootable usb , and then within the trial lubuntu , again try installing lubuntu , it does recognize the previous version and also gives me option to remove the same and do a fresh reinstall . i believe , this indicates both the drives are accessible and working fine . it 's only the problem with the bootloader which is where i think i went wrong somewhere . please help .
sorry i confused the number version . it 's 10.10. thanks

the options are 1. notebook hard drive 2. internal cd/dvd rom drive and 3. sandisk . below it says to hit f10 for bios set up options . based on the comments below it seems that i should go ahead with f10 and take a look at the bios options . i am confused by one thing : as i mentioned last week in a class that i was taking i did not have any issues booting off of the usb ( and i haven 's made any changes to the computer since ) . last week usb was # 4 on the list above . i am using a hp pavillion g6 with windows 7. i will let you know hot it goes with the bios options . thank you .

it 's 4gb . is it because of that ?
i edited the question . i 'm using the mate xenial ppa .
i installed libstdc++6-4.4-dev but it didnt help
no , it does n't work , because quoting prevents bash from using the wildcards . it will look for a path specifically with the name ( in my example ) `te*/'my files'/more` .
, i believe i have the latest nvidia drivers installed .
tried this without success . im wondering if i need to reinstall ubuntu or somwthing although it looks as if my settings are intact . my home screen still show my settings in the background tho .
i had to dpkg was not at all installed
i mean that terminating / killing the parent `bash` instance wo n't kill the process
i dropped to tty2 and did `lsb_release -cd` which said i was on 14.10 / utopic although the shell told me that new release 14.04.1 was available and that i should use `do-release-upgrade` to get it . am slightly confused . i have probably done something wrong .
edit i have just tried using 'giver ' and it seems to work for small pictures but not for larger things or folders . i used this guide succesfully ; ? rq=1 but i assume the programme isnt capable of moving 45gig folders at one time , but it should help someone wanting to move smaller files easily .
no .

is it necessary ? i want to dedicate the virtual interface to connect the pc 's virtual bridge to the physical bridge connected to `eth0` .
no i do n't , is that 's what 's missing ?
that command seems to hav found the item to be located at /usr/local/lib .
changed client pc to hpmini running lubuntu 14.04.3. connected ethernet cable to desktop . client pc booted with ethernet showing instead of its wireless interface . desktop ifconfig eth0 showed inet : 10.42.0.1 , bcast : 10.42.0.255. the hpmini ifconfig eth0 showed inet : 10.42.0.57 , bcast : 10.42.0.255. dns servers 127.0.1.1 , and search domain attlocal.net . the question can be withdrawn .
: no i had not tried that , but it worked ! so can you please turn that into an answer so that i can accept it .
i did n't mean that sorry

i do n't want my pictures directory to have mixed photos , so i have manually created a directory with the name `` wallpapers '' . so , every time i set a wallpaper from there , i get a copy that i do n't need . moreover , the wallpaper manager shows pictures only from the ~/pictures directory ( no subdirs ) , that i consider a bad practice , because i would get a bunch of irrelevant pictures there . i think that ubuntu should either : 1. copy the wallpaper to a hidden directory 2. or/and allow to select a wallpaper from ~/pictures/wallpapers at least there should be a check for existence before copying !

unfortunately i still am . the only other thread i 've managed to find on the subject is gathering tumbleweeds in the ubuntu forums , so it does n't seem like a common problem ...
any easy way to ( set up a ppa ) automatically package the mainline kernel source ? -
i m running 12.10
i simply need to be able to run some php scripts from the terminal
by `` a client image '' i mean `` a binary blob that i can download , and run as a virtual machine under ( e.g . ) virtualbox '' . @ bodhi.zazen you could learn how to [ trust images from www.random.com ] ( it 's easy . seeing further helps too .
not the best , maybe i should install other distro
yeah of course ! as long as it has some way to hook into window or workspace events so it is n't running all the time .
the files that i used for trying is one ppt , a pdf file and a text file inside the same folder .
that would defeat the purpose of using different workspaces - if i need to minimize what i 'm working on before switching to the other workspace , i might as well , just use 1 workspace and minimize back and forth ...
i did . i think it was the latest one . : ' (
in my previous
thank you , yes , i consult the file but what can i do to solve the problem ? noted that the first time to use
yes that 's exactly what 's happening ! i want to use bridged because it provides me two different ip addresses on the two machines , which is what i need . if there is an alternative ( more reliable ) method to doing so , do you have any suggestions ?
no , there were n't . installed successfully
the reasoning is that if you 're writing a local html5 app , you may want to call some dbus api from javascript ( like ubuntuone for example ) .
ca n't remember , but most probably was `sudo apt-get install mono-runtime`
think about some features , or maybe will harm bootloader or something like that..
**edit : ** reinstalled ubuntu , which made the issue disapper : unitl first reboot , after which they returned . **ad hoc solution : ** problem seems to be caused by the `/lib/firmware/auth10k/qca6174` being out of date in post # 9 at ? pid=1604276 # p1604276 user julianp provided a download for a his own working firmware . replacing your folder with his should fix the problem .
do i need to find it manually ?
i used tty to do the reinstall from another post on unity .
dell inspiron 1545
from here : -
gnome 2.30.2 , currently .
i 'm using gnome 2.30.2 with ubuntu 10.04. i 'd guess it has something to do with the fact that i 've added epiphany and gmail-notify to my list of start-up apps , but i 'm not sure .
ntfs file system
no , as long as i remember it was ntfs i do n't even know what sfs is
here is a screenshot of the authentication : ! [ screenshot ] [ 1 ] [ 1 ] :
if i do the terminal command `lspci -knn | grep net -a2` nothing shows up
**ps : ** those users have `sudo` permissions
no i am not cancel installation during downloading this package . in fact i have downloaded and reinstalled flashplugin-installer three times .
-- -- -- -- -- update : after running dpkg-reconfigure resolveconf for a felt 1 mio times , dns resolving works again . the file ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf was missing , which again makes me think , some file might be missing for the shutdown command as well . -- -- -- -- -- update 2 : as pointed to in the comments , the `init 0` and `init 6` command works .
yes . `\ls` works perfectly . it shows all the folders and files but not the hidden ones .
of course , updated the post with the output .
where is /home located ?
i did n't copy it but it was something about a physical memory dump
yes i can get into bios
the buttons under the touchpad work . if i switch the touchpad off in system settings , even the buttons wo n't work . so the touchpad is kind of enabled , but i ca n't move the cursor or scroll or anything . it 's just the buttons .
yes i did that ( i edited my question now , so that nobody shall be confused if or how i updated it ) . i know that that is a common error - the weird *is* just that it is n't working in spite of doing update-grub .
i am using the 32 bit architecture .
my card is amd radeon hd 6300
yes it works
the configuration file is that : and the commands used to bootstrap the new environment are these
: not configured for that .
i ca n't . that 's the thing . there is no description of the error , just `` sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code ( 1 ) '' .
you are the man dude ! honestly i checked the efi boot menu before and what i saw was this : ubuntu , ubuntu , efi network 0 for ipv4 , efi network 0 for ipv6 . i found it weird to have 2 ubuntu but just thought they where the same . so i would just select out of the two efi instead and both displayed `` checking media '' then it would revert to grub . thanks to you this time around when i checked , i decided to select ubuntu with the capital u. thats where windows 8.1 was installed . do i have to boot through efi to get windows 8 ? is there a way to change this ? like straight from grub instead ? thanks a ton !
thanks psusi , i am coming around to that way of thinking . the only other thing in there is /var/spool/cron . i think perhaps i followed the advice on that other page a little too blindly .
a bug in the kernel , fglrx driver , elsewhere ? where would you suggest i report it ?
i can access my own wifi however , its password protected so i have to enter my password initially , but when i went to a coffee shop today , it did n't seem to recognize the network . wondering if i had to configure a seperate wifi that is n't configured w/ a password like in network connections/add connection in pic1
that 's what i thought , but i ran kleopatra and it said it connected to gpg-agent just fine . i just did a clean install of kubuntu , anyways , and now it works .
: i am using a usb port with an m-audio fasttrack mkii for sound . it has worked fine in previous installations ( running an older version of ubuntu ) .
yes there are no disk space problems . i 've checked and all drives have plenty of space
no version info on welcome message `220 -- -- -- -- -- welcome to pure-ftpd [ privsep ] [ tls ] -- -- -- -- -- `
the problem would be the lan part ... wake-on-lan packages are not routed , so you would have to have access to a machine inside the lan to send the wol package ...
i do have ccsm installed , and i 've looked at the settings , but ca n't find anything useful . all the settings that pertain to the new switcher seem to be under the `` unity '' section , and there 's essentially only options to change the key bindings . the other switchers in the window management section all disable the new switcher and enable the older one .
.. that would be great
yes , i have # ! /bin/bash
perfect ! . alright , thanks , i shall try that . sorry for it being in many ways duplicate of other questions .
like here - [ problem building an rtl8723 driver ] [ 1 ] . and , in my case rtl_92ce_92se_92de_8723ae_linux_mac80211_0007.0809.2012.tar.gz gave me the same error ( i suppose drivers have

ubuntu 8.04 lts
dont know . that 's why i mentioned the computer type . how to find out the bluetooth device type ?
kluck , in man gedit not exists option `` -- standalone '' . i tried with - new-window but it still does not recognize open files ...
well nope , thx for the vote up
i can make it run using kvm , but my goal is to use grub and boot into it .
it was provided by aalto university for research relating to wireless sensor networks . here 's the link
thanks for your reply . the smart test shows there is a bad sector . i will try to contact seller for replacement .
well it does not seem to be a display issue . log file shows system halts when it starts looking for a wifi connection .
( this is not supposed to sound offensive ) but i do know something 's about computers
now my sound ( include players and os sounds ) is gone : (
the couple of programs i have tried compile fine so there is no error message from gcc . i just ca n't figure where the header is coming from . i have an editor that builds references to functions and syscall and the like and it is n't happy that it ca n't find the directory .
from the same directory as the file
yep , many thanks : )
edit : i 've just noticed the error libgomp1 : depends : gcc-4.8-base ( = 4.8.2-19ubuntu1 ) but 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04 is installed makes it impossible to install anything else . i 've just tried installing texlive-full and kile and had it as error .
sorry , you 're right . i just edited my question .
no ... closing of the terminal and/or restarting does not clear th e issue .
no , this was moved to stack overflow , where i solved the issue :
im not sure . i have given up on ubuntu as it keeps forgetting my screen configuration and i have to reconfigure it every time i boot . i still have ubuntu installed , so if you have any specific tests i could do to test if 3d acceleration works i am happy to try and report back .
below are the results when entered df -h in my ubuntu terminal
vi editor . echo $ term tells xterm
sure , is there any easy way of posting it ? the config file is rather large , with alot of stuff commented out , you want all of it ?
solstice , it returns this :
yes , they all clones and master vm show ifconfigs .
yes it spins , but slowly , at a constant speed , with no variations related to the temperature ( i.e . regardless of whether the cpu temp is 70c or 95c the rotation speed is the same ) .
there is no built-in way to change ubuntu 's font and i 'm not gon na download a tweak app for that . i have n't tried to reboot yet . i 'm using dell 's xps 13 ( 9343 ) . it has intel 's gpu .
yes , i mean playback by flash . thanks for your input ! though i really think this is an alsa/pulseaudio problem . on my second computer i do n't have problems while using flash , skype and vlc ( for instance ) simultaneously .
thanks for the response guys
just to clarify : sharing single picture from original : x mb to email size x kb . multiple meaning more pictures at the same time ( email for example ) . finally as my ubuntu touch rings on bq phone , i do n't see me typing in terminal to share a pic . android world has the same issue , i use to use `` image shrink ( resizer ) this adds entry to `` share menu '' in each app , resizes and goes back to share menu from which you can actually share with apps . anybody keen developing this ? i 'm happy to purchase support : - )
i also tested & discovered that esata and firewire are also totally slow on ubuntu 12.04 lts but fast on windows 7. as a further test , i booted the system on ubuntu 13.04 ( kernel 3.8 ) and 13.10 ( nightly build 2013-08-27 , kernel 3.11 ) live cds . usb3 was equally slow on both . however , when i booted on knoppix 7.2 ( kernel 3.9 ) , usb3 was fast -- just as fast as windows ! my vendor ( endpcnoise.com ) thinks that the asmedia chipset on my computer is the culprit because ubuntu 's support for it is `` rudimentary at best . ''
i use universal usb instaler , which extract file to usb .
database 1 is mysql on iis server . database 2 is mysql on linux server . i would like to bring ( linked ) table1 from db1 and table2 from db2 in common db tool and make union query from these 2 tables .
yes , it says : `e : unable to locate package unity-lens-utilities` , i think that might be the problem ...
and there it is
: - ) nice suggestion ... i would have prefer a configuration parameter that would have help me stop producing them : - )
it just sits there as a startup application . does n't figure as an icon on the topbar of the screen , like the dropbox icon ( my dropbox account it is linked to ubuntu ) so that i can conveniently change the brightness .
if you mean apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree i just did that , but i still do n't have a driver showing up configured under lshw -c network , or a wireless network

thanks . yes , i want to pipe output into it with ls -l. and that shebang might help a lot . i 'll certainly try it .
what did u mean by configure ?
i connected the ethernet cable and the pi . when i go to network settings.. it just says connecting..
yeah it 's on a separate partition
yes exactly . i can hear the ubuntu sounds , youtube and everything normall , using the interface output , but i can not record anything
it is currently set to 755. i do n't see how adding a group write will allow it to run , seeing as it was running perfectly before i restarted apache
i have an nvidia card but i do n't have any drivers installed on ubuntu

different `` cores '' showing different speeds via psensor . i will try this fix tonight .
it was in `~/.bash_profile` , i moved that to `~/.bashrc` and deleted the previous file since there were only the prompt customization and `ls` `grep` `dir` aliases for colored output in the file . based on your answer i got that if there is not `~/.bash_profile` file at all , the code in the `~/.bashrc` should be sourced , for both login and non-login shells ; therefore i did as you suggested and voila ! thank you so much !
i 've added the output of `pacmd list` and some more info on the audio quality . if you need *any more* info , i can provide it . i 'm also fine with getting my hands dirty with system files and the command line if needed . i just do n't know the internals of the linux usb stack or sound system very well .
ubuntu 10.10 maveric
thanks . yes , i was trying but it was showing some problem with sed command .
when i did a dpkg-scanpackages , it merely created a packages file . when i used reprepro , it created directories like main/ pool/ dists/ and i do n't remember what all . all i want is a repo - not an entire replication of the ubuntu repository .
, i can use existing software solutions
i can not see it in nautilus `` devices '' and am not sure how to access is otherwise .
i figured it out . i had not set permissions on the /media folder so that anyone other than the owner could see/use them . it 's all good now . thanks for the assistance .
ah ! ! my system got crashed . no gui . only terminal is working . i will need installation disc for installing ubuntu and for that i will have to download it . as system is not working in gui mode and i am not so expert to handle it in command mode . therefore , i thought to recover it so that display comes again and everything settles up . thanks for comments ! !
thanks . the implied question goes like this . if my hard drive crashes , can i get my data back from the files synced with ubuntu one ? if the answer is yes , as i am starting to suspect , will there be any disadvantage in dispatching deja dup to the trash ?
i have followed the instructions given in the following link when i run the captstatusui i get a window and when i give print command i get the error posted . by the way i was using ubuntu 14.04 64 bit system

i am using nvidia 's 304 driver . will get the lshw output in a moment , i am in another computer .
that didnt help much , a few updates happened though .
yes , that is how i run my executables on linux . the issue is that using `file` on an executable should give you a whole bunch of information about the bitness and the file format , but running `file` on main gives the output `data` ( i.e . not an executable file ) . i think @ gslin 's answer is correct .
i put the file in /usr/sbin so i could execute it from anywhere
i need automated tools which can take screenshot on every clicks and allows to add different notations into screnshot & exports them into .pdf
the usb device is not displayed as an option in the refit menu .

i do ! it looks like i have this as graphics : intel igd x86/mmx/sse2 . with windows i was able to customize the resolution by messing with the regedit stuff . i 'm looking to do the same thing with 12.04. my monitor can take the larger resolution , and all of the side panel stuff in my chromeo is huge . i should probably find a way to make that stuff smaller . thanks for the comment !
, what tools can i use to generate that necessary information
not that i 'm aware of.. i 'll take a look . dnsmasq was running , could it be that one ?
scrolling is the on i noticed the most , also i was trying to disable touchpad while typing using syndaemon and it was n't working at all ; it 's like my system does n't recognize it properly .
? **solution : ** i did not read the above link completely , at the end of the page it is mentioned what should be done in this particular case . i just used ubuntu 9.04 live cd and got it working..thanks every one for ur time .
what else could be wrong ? anything i should look for ?
: i have installed gnome 3.18 from the `gnome3` and `gnome3-staging` ppas .
sshd_config file is totally empty ? normal i guess not ? y
gnome-tweak-tool says no extensions installed . i have already tried reinstalling gnome-shell twice to no avail . its always the same .
i see there is this ?
i mean , mir , the newest unity that is still under development . it is not yet ready for desktops and it 's hard to navigate in it . it is unity 8 , am i right ? i do n't know if it is stable or not but right now the usability is very limited . that 's why i need to return to previous envirnoment and i do n't know how .
i 've updated the question with the output of `lshw -c network` . i 've tried several cables and several connections ( home and at work ) . and [ this ] ( is my `dmesg` output . oh , and both leds are always weakly on .
i bought a vps from ovh , i think it 's utopic ...
i did the command listed under trusty / desktop on the lts enablement stack wiki page which was `sudo apt-get install -- install-recommends linux-generic-lts-wily xserver-xorg-core-lts-wily xserver-xorg-lts-wily xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-wily xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-wily libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-wily`
i 'm sorry if this is a dumb question , but which one is the correct log : ib_logfile0 or ib_logfile1 ?
i did see that post . did not seem to relate to what i 'm trying to accomplish .
not familiar with the different repositories or apt in general . in previous forays into ubuntu i could get 99 % of what i wanted from software center and the other 1 % was apt-get install that worked first time . i will research and post update . btw , the accepted answer below works as far as installing gdebi . just wish the software app would work .
well , i use multiple gstreamer pipelines and ffmpeg on my nuc device to record and process multiple videos in hd and sometimes the cached memory gets so high which results in low performance ( i check it via `htop` ) this was my experience that by doing so , i clean the cache and speed up the system . do you have any other suggestion ?
yeah.. i want to provide information.. when i read all the existing docs on this particular ultrabook , there were some big gaps in the quality of the information . as you can see in 'wordpress ' link , i wanted to answer my own question but , the site does not let a noob do that . so i copied the answer to my own blog .
a few addons , i did n't check incognito . it seemed to happen most often when a page with flash started . but it also seems like a general ubuntu issue .
the speaker is working fine with windows . it was working fine in ubuntu 9.04 too . the sound profile does not show analogue stereo at all . any suggestions please ?
i 'm fairly new to ubuntu so i followed a guide . i 've tried `` -t ext4 '' but that gave me `` wrong fs type , bad option , bad superblock on /dev/sdc1 , missing codepage or helper program , or other error in some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail or so . ''
of course , i already installed the drivers through `` additional driver '' at system menu
user68186 , thank you for response , but i 've tried offered solutions , but they do n't help .

your solution worked ! thanks !

thank you for answer . _any specific reason for using the older 1.1 version of cryptography ? _ the reason is simple : this is a requirement of the web service code which i got to check . i asked the project manager if they can change to a newer version - so now i way for decision . and meanwhile i am looking for another solution . _many issues with openssl have been solved in newer versions._ so as i understand it correctly the problem depends on openssl libraries . _if you can not upgrade to a newer version at least try also 1.1.2_ i will try this solution tomorrow .

in this thread they are talking about the kernel being 3.17 for 14.04 lte . knowing what kernel version caused the problem is interesting if one wants to try other distros that are based on ubuntu .

xterm does n't open , konsole does n't work ( closes immediately ) . i did not modify any settings . all i 've done is set up my irc bouncer , mysecureshell sftp server , and my plex media server . it might be a residual setting from an old install because i 've carried over my home directory .
no , during the ubuntu installation was the first i encountered partitions , after which it was too late to use boot camp assistant ( or is it ? ) .
hi the file is ati-driver-installer-11-12-x86.x86_64.run its a driver on a pendrive for my ati radeon hd6470m that wont let me boot installation of 11.10. i wanted to install it to see if ubunto would then boot . probably best if you give me full instructions do i do it as antony @ antony or with a sudo comand etc ?
yeah , the screen is clearly lit* but black . what other tool should i use ? i read somewhere that unetbootin is n't good for debian/ubuntu ?
for some reason i do n't remember how i installed java .
if this helps my `type ruby` is `/home/user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.2/bin/ruby` and my echo path is `/home/user/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.2/bin : /home/user/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.2 @ global/bin : /home/user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.2/bin : /home/user/.rvm/bin : /usr/local/heroku/bin : /usr/local/sbin : /usr/local/bin : /usr/sbin : /usr/bin : /sbin : /bin : /usr/games : /usr/local/games`
when seleting an os to boot from using refind it gives me ubuntu with kernel 3.19.15. i followed these instructions to install
i ca n't get to the guest login after booting ( which was when the problem shows up ) . i am going to return the system tomorrow though , so am thinking i might just switch to sddm and leave it alone : (
no i have n't done that . can u please help me out to do that ... ?
ubuntu friendly , something that works with ubuntu and has client , unlike google drive . come on man , just asking for advise here so lets not get high and mighty .
totalstation bluetooth < - > ubuntu bluetooth . given that the totalstation has the standard serial configuration over usb , i suspect it is establishing a serial connection over bluetooth . of course , i could be completely wrong , at which point the answer that i 'm wrong and the bluetooth uses xyz is completely permissible .
i might pretty sure it is off .
thanks for your comment - @ grizly . i did`t get any error message . as you said , previously wi-fi was working fine with windows 8 .
it would be nice , but not necessary . the files that i want to check wo n't be accessed/changed by any threads all the time .
`rmod` was an invalid command , but `sudo modprobe -r 8139too` seemed to work . adding the module `8139cp` did n't fix it , though - the network tray icon now says `` no network devices available '' , and running ifdown and ifup does n't work - ifup says `` could not configure hardware '' or something like that .
tried that . left the battery out for several min ... no change

yeah . i had a bunch of cron tasks in the old crontab that is now deleted .
exclude the kubuntu and xubuntu isos , for example . perhaps there are an awful lot of them ( precise kubuntu arm , precise kubuntu i386 , quantal kubuntu arm , quantal kubuntu i386 ... ) and the initial mirror download could be finished more rapidly without those isos . but if it is only a few more gigabytes , perhaps it does n't matter so much .

how should i report it ?

i added some more detail .
yup , just did . kinda long but there it is .

hi @ jenswirth , i recommend use of live dvd but using refind i think you can solve your issue even if you try with usb . here is a tutorial which helps me : [ link ] ( step 4 type ./install.sh -- alldrivers ( tutorial based on refind v0.8.3 , -- esp no more available in v0.8.4 ) . skip steps 6 and 7 ( v0.8.4 do it for you ) . step 14 , make sure to create 2 partitions : one in ext4 format ( other dropdown : select `` / '' ) and a second in swap `` format '' ( swap partition must be between 1x to 1.5x your ram ) . ps : tutorial based on elementary os but it works for ubuntu ; )
*64* do you think is a good test if i try the *32* version ? the machine has 1.9gb ram
is there a standard way to remove everything with a command or will it always sufficient to remove the appropriate folder in my home directory work after purging the package ?
i 'm using ubuntu 12.04
it took over a hour then i gave up on it
i have identified that the computer is uefi enabled and i have managed to create a 100gb partition of free space ( for ubuntu ) ... but if i try to load the live dvd , it says `` no operating system '' ... but will load windows normally . if i switch to `` legacy '' mode ( from uefi mode in the `` bios '' ) , it will load neither , with the `` no operating system found '' error !

no , it is n't the same , so when i mix them up , the script will fail . ( but there are more steps in the script , so i 'd not like to restart from the beginning )
yes , that 's right .
the previous one extracted specific text in parentheses , and kept everything else that was n't inside parentheses . now i would want to extract specific text in parentheses , and keep only the text in quotes . but now the easiest option is to use heemayl 's solution first , and then run the solution to the initial question

i can get to the terminal by hitting crtl + alt + f1
no i am happy with my 80x24 size , but those numbers on their own are a useless metric for determining the physical size of the terminal . without knowing the pixel width of a column it is impossible to know the true width of the terminal .
mchid how would i go about doing that i set the port to and from to 80 and the ip address to 192.168.1.50 but its not going to my localhost .
thanks for pointing that out . i did now . and so i changed the scope of my question .
of course , did n't know that was important , it is a stonegate sg 500 ( www.andovercg.com/datasheets/stonesoft-specifications-sg-500.pdf )
i know , and the box will soon be upgraded . but i need it to work now .
great , thanks that worked ! feel free to convert to an answer and i 'll accept it .
: i think the process is `/usr/lib/kde4/libexec/apper-sentinel`
i am using windows 10. and also , i did n't know it matter where you run unetbootin from , but i just run it from the download folder . would that cause errors ?
`libmetacity-private3a metacity-common openssh-client thermald ubuntu-drivers-common`
that was just an dummy example . now i have added another example
new containers does n't have any issue , i am able to start newly created containers but not old containers .
**edit 1** when i run it from terminal with `software-center` command it outputs following messages : 2011-12-28 22:31:30,618 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.em - info - em 's : 17 15 21 2011-12-28 22:31:31,028 - softwarecenter.backend.reviews - warning - could not get usefulness from server , no username in config file 2011-12-28 22:31:31,102 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.utils - info - softwarecenter style provider for ambiance gtk theme : /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css 2011-12-28 22:31:32,513 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app - info - software-center-agent finished with status 0
13.10. all software has been updated .
how can i fix this problem ? **update** got another error from launching from terminal : warning ** : could n't register with accessibility bus : did not receive a reply . possible causes include : the remote application did not send a reply , the message bus security policy blocked the reply , the reply timeout expired , or the network connection was broken . traceback ( most recent call last ) : file `` /usr/bin/unity-tweak-tool '' , line 72 , inunitytweaktool.application ( ) file `` /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/unitytweaktool/__init__.py '' , line 79 , in __init__ executable_name=cmd_old.split ( '\x00 ' ) [ 1 ] indexerror : list index out of range
yes there is only the 64bit version , and i used unetbootin to burn it . i 'll try other tools and i 'll update the post .
did n't try to build a driver . i do n't have any wlan networks in the list . either the driver in the distribution does not work ( it also does not work in the live version ) or i am clueless .
well , they could always unplug it or hold the button down : ) and i do n't think any of them are familiar with the `shutdown` command . i do n't even need it to pop up a message or anything when they attempt to shut down ... just for it to stay running .
exact the same applies . the admin will have gui in english , the user will have ubuntu gui in his/her language .
yes i checked and my keyboard is ok : if i run another os or merely i start a console without x activated ( pressing ctrl+alt+f1 ) it works properly . it 's really strange issue .
no it was n't pre-installed.the operating systems are all installed in legacy mode .
dunno , i just observe that when i close or open terminal , the screen kind of tears up with white pixels
i had n't considered that yet . are all extensions from chrome also available in chromium ? if the functionality is similar enough , using chromium might be an acceptable solution .
it is set to `` black the screen '' . i tried to send the laptop to a standby mode by pressing sleep buttons ( fn+f1 ) and it went to a sleep mode , then i woke it up but screen was still blank .
yes , that what it looks like . i tried following the steps to black list , but when i get into my canonical folder , the only section inside of it is `` indicator ''
even if you can install , you cant use it ... what is your suggestion ?
yes its was connected throughout . with a message to restart
i installed it using ubuntu software center but it 's not working . and also tried the sudo command for installing it but still not working
thanks , ping never returns any error but i tried telnet and it also randomly fails to stablish a connection . to give more details , i changed the ssh port to another , the server have 2 network adapters but iam only using one at the moment without any problem .
oh when user creates an image in my firefox addon and they click a button to `` set as icon '' , it will then change the icon of that firefox profile .
no sorry . since then i just deleted the snippets , created new , restarted and so on . at some point the error disappears but i can not tell why .
if i do n't restart apache the page wo n't update . tried to purge apache , and is the latest version from the 13.10 repositories . i run php with mod_php
i have been using java 8 since 6 six months and i solved the problem by the way : ) @ hontvrilevente
yes , i meant 10.10. i probably will install 11.10 - but i want to get access to my files first . how can i log on with the correct credentials from my flash drive , so i can acces the files - or is there a different way ? thanks

i used all these but when i am trying to upgrade then i again show the line 0 upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded
yes , i did run these commands , and waited for a pretty long time . do you know what does `` ../ '' mean ? is `` ./ '' approximately equals to `` sh '' ?
it was already present . i uninstalled , purged and reinstalled . after reboot it was the same : dark purple screen and after a seconds , pure-black screen .
ethan : thanks ! ! ! ! any ideas if there 's some keyboard utility for 14.04 ?
hardware : ibuypower laptop with nvidia 680m graphics card , 1 tb hard drive .
it happens in both situations occasionally . ( that 's why my answer needed long time ... )
yes , i bought the installer disc because our isp 's network speed is slow and not reliable . thanks bro .
to be honest , i have n't tried any further yet . after i connected via nmtui , everything worked ; and i was n't able to test it with an other network yet .
if i try to boot without a monitor plugged in , the screen will be black when i plug it in . it does n't respond to any keys i press on the keyboard , and the num lock , caps lock , and scroll lock lights do n't come on when i press those keys .
this notebook ca n't be booted from usb .
so the output of the command i need could be : nautilus terminal chromium
no , it keeps on ` [ 216.996482 ] reboot : system halted` , i think that have something related to the acpi settings .
actually i was using the method from slap 's github page . (
this has resulted after installing wine which i had to do at root . this is the result : ls : can not access '/user/lib/sudo/sudoers.so ' : no such file or directory
thanks , but you 're not checking the `` cursors '' inside : o in other way , i 'm not sure about which directories are the `` really '' icon themes .
to make this clear , i only need the dongle because kubuntu wo n't now connect by ethernet , as it did before i reset the homeplugs . before , my desktop connected by ethernet in windows and kubuntu ; now only windows connects by internet . i think the dongle is ok , the problem is that wifi is always slower than internet . thanks zaka elab for reply ; sorry message was not clear
: a build system - like a makefile , or scons , etc .
my first attempt to move a question into an answer so it can be improved upon . this is as far as i get in the steps posted . it seems with this configuration that juju never sees the other machines added to the maas cluster .
5. sometime i am shown to `` journal recovery '' screen , where mostly it does it job and i have to login again for a new sessions or a few times i even have to perform ***fsck** on **/dev/sd6*** manually .
yes . thank you for any help : - ) . ( and previously i was running 14.04 )
version number goes up after update . i 've been hesitant to use the program , given my concerns .
edit : my problem is that it uses as graphics card the intel and not the dedicated radeon .
yes , i am still looking for an answer .
ok with these very useful tools ( tcpdump , netstat and the different logs ) , in can confirm there is no anomaly for the connection . my client is connecting with tcp protocol every 2 minutes , changing of port at each connection . on the server side , the connection looks to be granted , but nothing is recieved , up until the the server close the connection ( time out ) . the issue looks to come from the client . if you have still some time , one last question : if i succeed in sending data , to close cleanly a connection after sending , my client should send connection : close \r\n\r\ at the end of get ?
, honestly , mplayer is a mystery to me - i know nothing about it .
i have added the required output to the post . i am using ubuntu 10.10 ( 64 bit ) .
the option to restart also is missing from the contents of the right hand top corner drop box . the error i did get twice on startup was that the software center had to 'close unexpectedly ' .
not an nvidia , it 's really an intel video card . i did n't installed any proprietary driver for it , everything was working fine with the default ubuntu configuration .
sudo apt-get install zsnes
thanks root45 . i have fixed the problem . see my post above . it might not be the problem of texlive 2009. it might be the problem of pgfmath.sty .

, thanks for responding . i 'm aware that new versions of anything could have bugs , but over the years it 's been safe enough to largely allow upgrades . however , in this one case , the bug halted me working or using my computer entirely , so i 'm only seeking caution in this one instance , because the process of recovery is quite painful . i tried seeing [ where to report a bug ] ( on the package , but it certainly is n't obvious or easy .
dear @ andrew.46 , from time to time i manually download the latest version through my web browser and replace the old script using nautilus file manager . i was wondering whether someone else had already created a very widely used package to automatise this as i had imagined this to be a very frequent problem ( since ubuntu does n't always ship the latest software of any kind of small script ) .
my toner is not empty yet as confirmed by hplip . but the pages come out extremely `` dirty '' with patches of toner all over them . if i pull out the whole unit i do n't see any exposed areas that look like they need cleaning . maybe a faulty unit ?
no , only if i run the first comands
sadly , i cant . i 've tried the inbuilt screenshot button , and other screenshot applications , but as soon as the floating box looses focus , it disappears .
how do i find out , whats my desktop manager ? and i mean this sound indicator : mean that wide slider , not the icon , where the pointer is ... .
yes the system is setup with a single partition with /boot on the root partition . i have run update-grub several times while the root partiton is mounted as read/write with no change .

not exactly . while helpful , neither of the given answers fully solved the problem . i eventually installed antergos and it somehow worked . i must have made a mistake somewhere or misunderstood something . i 'm pretty sure antergos was installed and configured to boot in legacy mode . but the main thing is i did n't ever figure out what went wrong since the antergos installer takes care of everything for you .
please suggest how to fix this .

`which javac` returns nothing ; `update-alternatives -- list javac` returns `update-alternatives : error : no alternatives for javac`
solution is overkill . it is a nice feature , indeed , but overkill . essentially , i want to run some `xset` and `xinput` commands to reconfigure my mice and touchpad whenever one of them gets connected .
the winefile program runs so fine . i mean , i can see any folder , any file , with any name , with or without latin characters .

i have a backup drive from october 2011. the exact image of the same drive with the same directory structure . i backed it up using clonezilla . can that somehow help to remap the drive correctly and recover my files ? if so , how ? fdisk -l returns sda1 as swap drive 14gb , sda2 as core ( my drive name ) 140gb . before fsck this partition was not recognized

georg , i 've installed gnome-shell my self and it 's the de i 'm referring to . zoredache , the vpn i 'm trying to connect to is using pptp but i would prefer if the solution could work for more than one type of protocol .
yes i have passwordless ssh with both alice and bob . i have verified this with `ssh alice @ node ; ssh bob @ node`

thomas ward : that is exactly what i want .
as i wrote below , what i want to do is not to lose time while looking for the folder i 'm working in . i could use a terminal but i still have to change directory ( using cd ) . i could use gedit , but i will have to go manually to the folder where i want to create my new file .
and @ aizuddin zali i solved it very reinstalling that linux-image-extra-3.19.0-30-generic . thanks .
no , there is no important data ,
i wanted to add it inline but as a new user i do n't yet have the privileges . i 've added the imageshack link , as suggested . i added from google drive as it automatically uploads from my phone so it was more convenient for me - please do n't neg me for it . : /
correct , but it 's a lot of packages to uninstall and then install again . i 'd prefer more elegant solution . actually i 've done that uninstalling once , but there were some dependency issues , as desktop is tightly integrated with power saving and some other components , so there was no clean way to uninstall desktop . i would n't like to run to these issues again .
thanks @ whtyger , i do n't have a live cd right now , but it 's happening with both ctrl keys , do you think both can be physically wrong ? what are the chances of that happening ?
i understand but is n't that a version that is played through an online server ? and how much do i need to pay ... again ... for a game i already paid for at game stop and own outright ?
i do n't know what 's the default , but i assume it 's on disk since i travel with my laptop and it does n't affect my battery .
thanks i did n't have time to do it until now , but i 'll try that .
the server is not reachable since it is mounted in very high altitude ( for estimating weather pollution ) so i can only reset it .

sadly i do n't know . i got a window when starting ubuntu ( after having logged in ) saying `` critical system error '' with the option to report the error ( i guess to canonical ) and nothing else .
i appreciate your comments , but the answers to your questions/points are in the console sequence that i pasted in the op . except for the question about purging , which yes , i did .

windows should be on the 4th partition . think it would be possible to see the windows folder structure if i connect the hard drive to a windows or if i just install windows again ?

i 've found that my hardware is highly not supported for ubuntu , but it seems to work fine with linux mint based on benchmarks and my personal experience for around a month now . so i moved into linux mint from ubuntu . try checking your hardware compatibility with ubuntu . cheers
nope . i do not have to enter any proxy settings anywhere ... ..same sites i can access thru browsers .

removed the last part since it is not related to the question at hand
yes , i have cairo
i 'm on 12.04 , why ?
the actual command i gave was `/etc/init.d/apache2 restart` due to not paying attention but normally `/etc/init.d/apache2 start` which results in pretty much the same blob of text .

i already have the files for a windows boot disk inside the hard drive ( or at least i think i do . not really too sure how the windows backup system works ) . i 'm asking if the ubuntu boot disk ( backup ) files will interfere with the windows files if they share the same disk , and vice versa .

both flash and html5 have this problem . after doing a lot of experimenting , it looks like the sound will work in other applications if something like xbmc is keeping the hdmi audio stream active . the browser itself will not open the hdmi audio stream to start playing unless xbmc is open . is there some type of fix or script i can run to keep that hdmi audio channel open all the time like windows would ?

i have been accessing the operating system simply via terminal interface ( from alt f2 at the login screen ) , so the response is `` error : unable to open display '' . i installed lxde to run the test . when i run the test in this environment , the opengl vendor string is `` nouveau '' , the opengl renderer string is `` gallium 0.4 on nvaf '' and the opengl version string is `` 3.0 mesa 9.2.1 '' while all of the checks report `` yes '' .
thnx , but i think their was a bug in the recent numix theme update .
as i already mentioned in my question , this does n't work
i do , but i have n't found a way yet .
i was , but when i upgraded to maverick it caused all kinds of problems so i removed it and installed the version from the software center . that said , when i look in the software center , under provided by ubuntu i have avant window navigator , but there 's still a ppa for awn testing team listed , and the dockmanager-daemon package from that ppa is still installed . no idea what that means or if it has anything to do with the behavior i 'm seeing .
do you know how to fix it , dobey ? i 'm a fairly new linux user .
no , sadly , while touchegg can see the events go past , it seems to ignore my preference and still maps all 3-finger gestures to nautilus window move . in compiz-unity is just ca n't see any events at all , so at least two bugs ! i will investigate myself when i have time , and just live with `ctrl+opt+arrows` to move between workspaces : (
but the answer did n't work ... here is the sources list with `` # '' on the 60th line as you said :

edited with that information .
it returned a message saying dpkg failed and a commend to enter . i entered the stated command and the install appears to be continuing . i 'll post up the end result when it 's finished .
yes its apache 404 and i can see edits i make to the home page
of course not , it is a stub for question .
yes , for this particular case , it is always ` % `

lem me check the answer
i upload a picture to help you .
exactly , but when i put them into the dependencies , it just says the packages is dependent on them , it does n't automatically install it
yeah so i treid turning off with xrandr , what happens is that my primary screen also turns off ! it 's as if my primary screen is dependent upon the external monitor edit : my display setting -
yes , that 's it , it works , thank you very much . i found the headset in pavucontrol and was able to turn it on again - it was not visible in the `` sound settings '' after i did choose the `` switch off '' profile - that is to correct by ubuntu i guess . thank you again .
yeah sure . i will add .
unetbooting software .
yes i do have ubuntu restricted extras installed . i use to be able to watch dvds . im kinda thinking it was an update that messed things up .
there are two previous questions dealing with this . the first one is a generic `` getting ubuntu running on an n56vz '' which has an answer for making the subwoofer work : other is the previous version of this question , which the op never updated :
edit : i fixed the error by adding & at the end of the lines . thanks for your help !
: the 6 hours is correct , the 13 % is n't .
i am trying to download desmume ( gtk ) and my version is 14.04
with `` xdg-open /usr/share/2048/index.html '' i can open the 2048 game . how can i assign `` xdg-open /usr/share/2048/index.html '' to the 2048 game icon in the unity dash ? and how do you put your syntax with a grey background ?
so i ca n't update my current user ( call it hellzone ) as root ?
because i hate reinstalling all my apps and ppas , icons and themes . my hd crashes the installer sometime and i just generally hate installing everything from scratch .
wait..how to put images ?
muru i did . thanks for checking that .
also i 've already tried a diferent number of combinations in the sound settings window .
when i try to install vim i am getting this error :
no , i completed till what i have mentioned in post because author is setting up from source and i am setting up from repository
i 'm already to the latest version but i 've find the solution ! read below : d
fixed . i modified the root 's path .
i did the recommended instructions provided by that thread .
yes i did , because it gave errors . i allready tried resilvering and scrubbing , export and import of the pool , but i think it 's hopeless ... and i will start over : (
removed it . i want to figure out how ubuntu handles this issue and i 'm not looking for a solution for the broken `vlc` binary . this might be off-topic because it requests an off-site resource , but i do n't seem to figure this out otherwise .
only on ubuntu .
both will be suitable . for now i only know how to create sinks using **pactl** , and how to redirect running application to that sink using **pavucontrol** . but i still lacking knowledge of how to redirect sound from that sink into output .
yeah it 'd be really useful if i knew that . i was doing a `do-release-upgrade` thing and was n't paying attention . i do n't think i can get the answer now .
i did try searching for it but i only find the codes for compiling on my pc ( under /usr/include/c++ ) but not the files for cross-compiling for the arm devices .
- `gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad` is installed - the movie plays fine in totem
classic mode is enabled .
no from terminal actually thats why by mistake i written network.conf i changed the interfaces file and kept it static .
ok , i found a theme that does it -- faenza radiance . i 'll try to copy what it has going on .
thanks for the help , people , but ubuntu crashed on me yesterday , and i see little reason to try and repair it , as it 's more trouble than it 's worth in my opinion . installing
the comment line . the syntax error would explain the lack of effect : gksudo goes through its motions , but the shelled-out command fails . without the semi-colon , we get separate gksudo and xdg-open : nautilus processes , and the gksudo line does not return until nautilus is shut down . the 'disown ' is redundant with the ampersand and is ignored , it seems .
the problem has been solved in the meantime . i had to set the mtu to a different value ( 1348 ) to fix it . the cause is still unknown , though .
well it was basically 3 years ago , but i reckon it was because , at that moment , the hdd was on a place that had a lot of external heat . after moving it to a room with more of a cold climate , the issue still persisted , although the temperature went from 68 degrees to 37 degrees . so the issue was an external temperature rise that created the issue in the beginning but was still showing after moving it to another place .
somethings like that
nah , there are n't . but the indicator applet and clock are there .
the latest version of ubuntu ( 13.10 )
__update : __ it 's strange : when i boot to macos and try changing retina display resolution to scaled it also offers 1440x900 , but the resulting picture is very good .
from this link i downloaded .deb
( when using ctrl+f or similar keys )
: i use amd radeon graphics . will check out the details next time it happens and post them here ! fortunatly i 've been going a few days without getting dropped now , i 'm almost starting to hope the issue has been solved through some update i 've made ...
when i reboot my ubuntu server dont have gui .
i wanted to do that but i could n't take a screenshot when i hover over 'activities ' or when i alt+tab . can you tell me how to take screenshots ? because prtscr and pasting it does n't work .
no , 2,4 ghz only and i am now in ubuntu 15.10 , but problem existed since 14.04 and still exists .
=============================================== resolution : lp # 1010931 14e4:4727 [ dell vostro 3555 ] broadcom bcm4313 5ghz does n't work but 2.4ghz does the root cause is the card is single-band only , so it would never broadcast at 5ghz . to fix the 14e4:4727 on ubuntu trusty 14.04 , uses brcmsmac : sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree then you need to blacklist b43 and wl driver like this : echo `` blacklist b43 '' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf echo `` blacklist wl '' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf sudo modprobe -r b43 wl brcmsmac sudo modprobe brcmsmac echo `` brcmsmac '' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
i am giving this script to non technical person , in which he will replace the variable values with zip file name which can be different every time .
no not at all , i reinstalled the os at least ten times over the last couple days , after each time i tried a different fix , just to make sure i had n't accidentally done something like that .
but why hidden binary in /etc ? it is statically linked . and so few references from google ? **also dpkg does n't know of it** . it looks strange .
surprisingly it is o.o
i launch the .run file , it asks me for my password ( never happened in 32bit ) , i enter in the password and a window pops up and says `` you need to run this installer as the super-user . '' this is confusing to me because i am the main account on the computer .
i am using a mobile broadband modem.first i am getting : `` you are now registered on the home network '' . few seconds later : `` disconnected . you are now offline '' .

nothing special .
the repository used to install gnome 3.18 were `ppa : gnome3-team/gnome3` and `ppa : gnome3-team/gnome3-staging` . `gvfs-google` and `gvfs-goa` where not installed and when i tried to apt says `` unable to locate package '' @ dadexix86
**edited** the error received is due to a known bug on google chrome ( see my answer down ) . the proposed solutions fixed the problems .

that works , but how do i do it in the nautilus gui ?
oh , no -- do n't worry , we 're not trying to compile glibc ourselves . sorry if the question implied that . we just updated ubuntu ; glibc patch was included .
i 'm not voting anything but the original question was about alternative skype client while mine question is about alternative voip piece of software .
any window . file browser , terminal , web browser , etc . i think i was very specific about the error , but to be clear : the expected output of the put command is that the window moves from one display to the next and stays there . the output described in my scenario is that the window moves to the next display but does not stay ... it bounces back 1 second later .
windows is a uefi boot - the 2tb hard drive is not partitioned as of yet , but i plan to partition it using the live cd into a 200gb ext4 format . how do i ensure that i 'm installing ubuntu in uefi mode ?
thanks for the advice . i 've edited the original nautilus desktop files in /usr/share/applications back to their default state . i 've copied the org.gnome.nautilus.desktop file into my ~/.local/share/applications directory and used gedit to edit its exec line . i 've rebooted . i 've run the source ~/.profile command . sadly , still no joy . when i start nautilus from the launcher bar , it still starts in my home directory instead of in my documents directory .
no . ca n't ping 127.0.0.1 also
i just have one internal drive with nothing on it .
i installed virtualbox via `sudo apt-get virtualbox` and yes i did type setup and got the previously stated error message
it is n't getting installed . shows a unicodedecode error .
i would have preferred that they occupy less but i do n't know how to do this ... if you know other solutions please let me know
yes , running `/home/dnaneet/desktop/./checkup.sh` works fine . but `/home/dnaneet/desktop/checkup.sh` may not work right ? because it needs a `./` ?
it 's on a usb , and live usb certainly is not the desired solution . i have failed to use `fstab` and bind ntfs folders to the ones in my ubuntu install .
i just tried and got below two lines error in terminal , `** message : prime : no offloading required . abort` `** message : prime : is it supported ? no` something wrong with my nvidia driver installation ?
its nvidia geforce mobile 6500 series i suppose
ken sharp : yes , the one in /usr/bin gives positive return for opencl . ( had n't known i had clinfo ! ) so i suppose my original question is answered , thanks . also , i 've managed to get opencl with boinc ... changed to fglrx-updates from additional drivers . reboot to load , reinstalled boinc , then must always use boot-up manager to stop/start boinc , and opencl gpu processing is ok. this did n't work when i posted my original question , but it does now ! ? hope this experience helps others .
yes , using a script to manually mount the remote sshfs , do some backups , and dismounting when done .
yes , it does . ah ! that sounds suspicious ... . hmm .
using unity . i did uninstall screenlets and rebooted , and all the extra icons showing in the more apps were gone , but as i soon as reinstalled screenlets they all came back . i never installed or used any of them .
: the actual connection is much faster -- i get downloads of 1mb/s pretty much everwhere **except** aptitude related stuff . the mirror in this are just seems to be extremely slow .
i do n't understand the question -- those were the correct times when i took those screenshots . it 's displaying the utc time in the taskbar instead of pst .
it 's a gui application , for windows we can find many programs as `helpinator` , `helpsmith` , `help & manual` ...
i 've got the same problem one two computers . with one i 've used the ubuntu software center and on the other i 've downloaded the .deb file . same problem : (
i 'm using gnome classic and not unity .
sorry , i changed kernals and thought you 'd want to see the update status ?
this is the gnome-shell testing ppa for oneiric `` ppa : ricotz/testing ''
like i said , im super new to ubuntu and i cant get all the way through the 'install '
the missing drive is internal ... i never had dual boot or linux previously installed . i only made the ubuntu live usb to get past bios , without it whenever i would save and exit bios it would just re open bios
unfortunately no - i gave up and started using git for pushing the code for all projects on that server . it is a dev/testing server only..
i tried to but there were no updates then .
i have never seen such a message

note that i 'm running the game zork via terminal ( emulator ) , i installed it with these steps :
as the main display experiences the same problem , and the problem does not occur on my windows os . i highly doubt that this is the problem .
the section that i want to check between the files is after the mount point /mnt/app/ or /mnt/temp/ , i 've edited it again , so just the /1tier/2tier/filename.exe will be checked .
: please forgive my stupidity , but when you say `` starters '' , are you referring to application launchers and shortcuts ? i could also look into other des to see if one is a better fit , but i really love xfce4 so far . i just think that everyone 's personal computer should be exactly what that individual needs for a fully optimized workflow/user-experience down to the smallest details .
edit : to clarify , i like to drag webpage links to the desktop ( or another directory ) where a .desktop file is created . however , i do n't like the `` link to ... '' naming scheme . i realize i could rename the files as a second step , but i 'm asking if there 's a way to avoid that step .

edit : the rsync version on my mac is 2.6.9. macuser $ rsync -- version rsync version 2.6.9 protocol version 29 if what @ jan in the comments below is true , namely that the option is not available until a later version , that gives me an answer for **why** it is not working , although i do not know how to fix it in a secure way : while i update programs on my ubuntu all the time , the thought of using terminal on my mac for updating shell programs is a bit scary to me . suggestions ?
thank you could you please help me with finding the proper driver for nvidia geforce 7025
. note : *that ubuntu-desktop is not installed yet on the destination server ( the ubuntu 15 ) ... i do n't know if this matters ! *
yes , if i `telnet machinea.local 5900` from machine b i get a `` connected to machinea.local . '' message - i take it this is a more reliable test than pinging and ssh since it happens on the port in question ? the problem remains but i 've updated my list of actions ! : )
i wanted to add a .iso entry in grub2 menu .
never mind . i rebooted and it works fine now . oh well .
well , it 's a new laptop and when i called toshiba service , they mentioned uefi . the initial issue was that toshiba qosmio x870 that came with windows 8 was n't detecting ubuntu live cd/usb until i disabled the secure boot . now i 'm able to boot to windows 8 with secure boot disabled and also boot the live usb . the problem is that when attempting to install ubuntu after trying it , it does n't detect windows 8. it shows only two options as explained in the question . can you please explain what you meant by booting ubuntu normally ? thanks

thanks , i do n't have access to windows but i do have a mac running os x lion . when plugging it in to that it says it is windows nt file system ( ntfs ) and it works perfectly . i can read and write to the disk , no error messages . is there any way to make it work on 16.04 ? the only thing i can think is to transfer the data bit by bit on a usb stick to 16.04 and then reformat the hdd ( how i do n't know ) . is there a way just to make it work ? thanks
good comment , thx ! i also thought about this but found the following information on the ubuntu website : images of ubuntu may not work at all on the system or may not work well , though canonical and computer manufacturers will try to certify the system with future standard releases of ubuntu .

good question and i will check , although would that explain why under windows the speed is much better ?
downvoters just clarify why that , am asking about one command that delete an existing directory
no , it 's a typo sorry . `` i installed and configured openvrt on ubuntu server ( .15.254 ) '' = > i installed and configured openvpn on ubuntu server ( .15.254 ) the server running on vm . i write the router spec . i do n't know it has some special firewall or something . anyway i found the solution , see my next comment .
i want to bypass this error and run the application as root .

i mean every `` web '' apps.. , the first step is to make the roundcube and owncloud use the same password table , or the same login session . well i do n't know how the integration should work..
names only appear for me when i have manually added them to lync . it 's a major pain and would love a solution to that .

thank you @ ridgy
-- secure boot was disabled when i installed ubuntu . -- many of the questions i read earlier seemed to deal with the order of boot options on grub , which i did n't see as a relevant problem . most of what i read was about grub and using the terminal , but from what i can gather , the problem might be how i installed ubuntu or something else not grub-related .
hi and thanks , i updated my question with the content of the yaml file . as you can see it 's the basic example .
**update** doing `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` does not rectify the situation
i am using ubuntu , and the problem is above mentioned , localhost is not opening.while seeing the status through $ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp status - > it shows all is running but while stopping them it shows fail to stop apache.what is the sollution ?
i did n't format it - it was pulled from another device , i 'm trying to recover the data .
it 's not there .
actually it 's been coworkers upgrading their personal machines at home , mythtv boxes and such . either way i think b looks like the best option and hopefully i 'll have your upgrade experience and not theirs
i did change the gtk+ theme combobox because i thought that was sufficient . i do n't really understand themes too well . i just found a setting in appearance called theme and that did solve the problem . if this is the right place , now i 'm wondering how to install new themes because i dropped some things into .themes and they do n't show up in appearance .

when i try that it just checks the install cd for differences with 12.04 and does n't start the usual install sequence for the 10.04 ie nothing to click on
i have n't done this ( hacking and all ... ) deliberately but i am sure that i messed up with something ... anyway added output in the question itself
actually , using the * wildcard with chosen letters returns a full sentence : `error : site [ the_full_name_such ] does not exist ! `
the strange part is this : # cat /proc/swaps filename type size used priority /dev/sda5 partition 2018296 0 -1 only show the swap part sda5 , like it should be .

: i was n't really sure either , but since i 'm not too familiar with linux o/s 's , i was hoping it was doing something more useful than that ( or perhaps this was just a *better* way than simply renaming the binary ) .
right now , that consists of moving it back to the vm and looking through log messages . but i ca n't find anything wrong . the only noticeable issue i 've seen is with sshd .
they are added to the fstab , but that made things worse by making the rediscovery of the drive not remount the drive , hence manual intervention .

sure , done . it looks fine to me right now . but i have just delete some `` old '' files .
i put in the `` sudo startx '' and my home screen comes up but nothing else . no time date icon or any of the icons down the left of the screen . it might be easier to just go back and use the older os ? any suggestions ?

i 'm using mate desktop environment 1.8.2 distibution , ubuntu 15.04 .
just updated it now . i had 2 more terminals . but still , i 'm getting my user 2 times .
the application was the issue , as everyone pointed out , cp was doing its job and copying everything . as it turns out , the application generates the images but if it ca n't do a direct replacement it generates a *.00 # file . my fix was to clear the old images from the folder where the images are made before running the program , and do a more specific cp as jacek suggested.. so should this question be flagged or answered ? considering scp was n't the issue

my biggest problem is that that documentation is incomplete and quite outdated ... i downloaded the actual code to have a better understanding of what it does , and i see that the documentation in the code itself is actually more up-to-date ... i also think the juju.ubuntu.com/docs should brag a lot more about the python helpers . they are very handy but guides and tutorials about them are almost nonexistent ... i 'll rephrase my question and submit an answer to make it a real question and we can marked it solved .
yeah , i have .
i just did a clean install of ubuntu so the `` default '' one ? ( gnome terminal maybe ? )
thank you but no i need to transfer an archive files and word files .
does n't microsoft have the habit of making things as hard as possible for those who want to use other oss ? if i recall correctly , they added a bunch of s**t in windows 8 that gave me a few headaches when i installed ubuntu in dual-boot with it on a friend 's pc .
edit* i justst installed it using the disk i had made back when i dual booted my other computer awhile back , and i just partioned my disks in the setup . when i 'm in the text mode i think it is fully functional because when i goctrl+alt+f1it gives me the option to login , but its all text based .
honestly , i 'm afraid that i ca n't . i 'm not sure how to check the permissions that each user has . however , if i run ls -l in the include directory , everyone has at least read permissions . i should also mention that when i use the -l flag and a link to the include directory where iostream lives , the code will still not compile . sorry for the vagueness !

i do n't know ; if so , i do n't know what it is and i have n't found any references to it anywhere . that 's kind-of what i was asking here . there 's an old ( 2012 ) question on the topic , but , well , it 's old .
no.today i realized that xubuntu do n't boot only when i 'm restarting a computer.so i need to turn off it and turn on again .
i have about 500 audio files and i want to filter/sort them anywhere and anyhow . i imagine there is some little library or script for terminal , where i could just set folder , and i 'll get a list of files and their speeds ( could be sorted as well , but regex could do too ) . but any solution like filtering them in some audio player or so would be enough too .
yes , using _local address book_ setting .
no , not even a bios output . would i need to configure the bios first ? if so , using the specifications in my question , are there any specific things i should take note of when configuring my bios ?

this is exactly what i did : testing php5 and mysql in order to test php script you need to create simple php script in directory /var/www/html . in this case ill create phpinfo.php : sudo touch /var/www/html/phpinfo.php sudo nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php add the following line into file /var/www/html/phpinfo.phpphp phpinfo ( ) ; ? save and test the php script you have made from web browser by typing in address bar it will appear like screenshot on below .
thanks andol ; but no , i think this stands as one question . basically , `` what happens if rsnapshot/rsync gets interrupted in middle of transfer ? `` , and i think the tools span one specific niche , so this does not imo warrant two separate questions . i posed the question of 'incomplete snapshot ' as one potential result for clarification purposes .
i had previously installed ubuntu in 2 partitions : / ( root ) in /dev/sda2 and /home in /dev/sda4 . i formatted the root directory ( sda2 ) and reinstalled ubuntu 14.04 instead of previous , but kept my /home partition ( sda4 ) and user directory same as before ( including user name ) .
i checked `menuconfig` . in the acpi menu , the option `debug statements` , whose additional information tells it is `config_acpi_debug` , is checked .
sorry , ' ... not work ' means no sound . in the meantime i removed pulseaudio . vlc now connects to alsa and sees all alsa cards available , but it ignores the command line switch 'hw= ' and opens the default alsa device , which most likely is the built-in card having no speaker attached . anyway , it looks like little progress is made , but the target is still unreached ...
i think my partition is not an encrypted partition . i 've never use a tool to encrypt my partition.furthermore , in legacy mode i can mount all partitions .
whats live session ?
i think probably my problem refer to the connection source that i choose for downloading texllive ... . i m not sure . i get the installer in this form : .gz from the : . and then run : sudo perl install-tl
the command `sudo apt-cache policy laptop-mode-tools` returns : `` installed : ( none ) ; candidate : 1.68-3ubuntu1 ; version table : 1.68-3ubuntu1 500 ; 500 xenial/universe i386 packages . ''
what version are you using ? i tried this on linux mint ( rosa , ubuntu 14.04 ) and ubuntu mate 16.04
it does nothing
, i did as ext2 , and if i give : sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raidarray gives an error mount : unknown filesystem type 'lvm2_member '

well , yes , i prefer to solve this problem with the comand line tools . but i 'm also interested if there is some web site with this information . i will not use any solution with windows based apps ( i do n't have x server on my machine ) , but i will appresiate any kind of solution = )

because at times i may need to use that interface and it needs to be readily available in the event the other one wo n't work for the network ( s ) i use . which happens sometimes because of mac address restrictions .
dobey , conjure-up at process helps loading openstack on ubuntu16.04lts but it fails with an error i mentioned in my earlier post . this particular error can be fixed following through this url : xenial-proposed package is mentioned in this url as a fix .
here a screenshot that would explain it . on the left , it is a newer version of chrome . and on the right an older one which i definitely prefer . the fonts are sleek and sharp : ! [ enter image description here ] [ 1 ] [ 1 ] :
thanks a lot - that was the problem - if you do it ans answer i will accept it
i will gladly wait sir . also , i 'm very confused with gimp and i think i can gimpshop a try .
yes thats what i mean
i 've started a process in a normal ssh session , not a tmux session . i 'm looking to see if it is possible to assume a process via a tmux session .

nope . there is no such widget it seems . until it appears i am using the builtin timeclock
yes wifi has been working fine for ages . ( also it is a laptop not a notebook if that makes a difference )
it was put on the 4gb staples usb flash drive with unetbootin - the staples usb flash drive has not been recognized at boot so it has not been able to be used to put on the laptop harddrive .

no i 'm using desktop ... .how to do in desktop ?
- no solution yet although it seems to be a graphics driver problem . i am using an acer aspire 4750g with the dubious optimus chip set . have discovered that the problem occurs in browser windows displayed on an external hdmi monitor but if i drag that browser window to the internal laptop display it is fine . dragging it back to the external display fails again . i 'm running the default nouveau drivers -- last time i tried installing the nvidia drivers i lost the system completely and had to reinstall to get it back so a bit paranoid about doing that again .
`ifconfig` does confirm that it is the one . i took out the unnecessary parameters .
ram is 16gb instead of 8 gb . rest is same .
-- - post it as an answer ! it is the answer . thank you and bless you !
thanks : )
heh , i actually switched to firefox due to an unrelated issue . i guess i can simply accept your answer since it 's highest voted , although i have n't had time to extensively check the fix . *shrugs*

i did install ampps because it seems easy and it comes with all installed plus softaculous to install scripts quicly . i was working with it on windows but win 7 os was driving me crazy so i decided just last week to take it down and replace windows with ubuntu 16.04 but i 'm not yet familiar with it and command line . . i would just like to replicate my webserver and setup a development environment where work in a comfortable way with softacolous running as well . i did install tasksel and i will see to update the my question with whereis results . thanks about that mic0
thank you for your response.. i edited post to say 'ssh ' not 'ssl ' . sorry newbie here !
if you 're talking about the steam repo , i do n't believe they even have one for trusty .
- no i do n't have the proprietary drivers for my graphics card . i was looking into it , but could n't find much as on amd site it says that my graphics card is not included in the list of supported products for these specific distributions and amd suggests upgrade to a current graphics card model . also , when i go on `` software and updates '' it says that no additional drivers are available .
: i updated the question , please check .
well ... i 'm trying to fresh install ubuntu 15.10 on my current ubuntu partition and it says 'no root file systen is defined ' . is it possible that it 's part of the cause as to why ubuntu 15.10 wo n't boot up ?
icon is showing that bluetooth is on but it has n't option of adding a device..
`nvidia-304` is the current version .
no , weird output but still prints all files
the password does not work . there is no keyboard response whatsoever . i have tried the correct password , and it does not work
no unity bar does not load . i boot op and come into the desktop .
audio should be streamed to , because i want to stream music or comment on what i am doing
hi . i firstly installed 16.04 but had to quit it and go to 14.04 because of lack of performance , i think because of the amd graphics lack of drivers ' stuff . anyway i 'll give it a try since i don ' remember if there were wifi problems .
there is no flash drive . and when the ubuntu open , appear the instalation menu for ubuntu . then i close this menu and the ubuntu open
nope this is n't a fresh install ; i installed ubuntu 12.04 around 2 weeks ago .
many answers but indeed i could not make it work
update with more details : it 's a desktop with nvidia gtx 980 ti . not quite sure about the usb ports - it says `` ss '' and i looked in the device manager and found `` generic superspeed usb hub '' .
- i suppose that would work , but as i read it then all terminal instances would update one large shell history ( as alluded to by @ steeldriver ) . perhaps this entire question is a misunderstanding on my part of the intricacies of terminals vs shells .
i believe i 'm using gnome and i 've already tried using f1 and such , it wont let me type the password for it .
i just booted the live usb i screwed my intallation with and it lists the windows 7 partition as `` xubuntu '' . `` xubuntu '' has a filesystem called `` lvm2 pv '' . am i screwed or can i change it back to whatever windows uses without losing data ?
i have used crontab -l command to check the cronjobs
there is a virtual piano website , and i want to play piano and record it while i 'm listening to it from my headphones and not outloud .
as per my description above , i am unable to login into the mysql server , so i am trying to modify the password . when i type the folloing command : set password for root @ 'localhost ' = password ( 'password ' ) ; get the following error : error 1133 ( 42000 ) : ca n't find any matching row in the user table therefore i am unable to modify the password and to login into phpmyadmin page . hope is that clear .
no . i think i 'll make a reinstall of ubuntu some other day .
no change , but when executing that command , i noticed the following output : ` ( soffice:20464 ) : gdk-warning ** : gdk_window_set_icon_list : icons too large`
32-bit , because laptop has less than 1gb of memory .
thanks the link worked , also beta driver is there for gpus and apus
cron is not accepted - it 's dangerous to run these actions without checking application after that . also during these tasks app is unstable and no need to run it every day - only when running script manually ( deploying an app ) but not more often than once per day
**edit** this is a 80gb western digital that needs to be shifted to 350gb western digital . i have configured the machine to be my dev machine , after 2 days of configuration i discovered the mess . i want to move it completely , like an `` image '' , any chance for that ?
there are too many files to type out there are 88 deb files . downloaded from sourceforge it seems that apache subcontract it to a third party - perhaps that is the problem ?
added a reference to the answer .
thank you all for the info . have now generated 'hash-codes ' following your advice .
genius.. figured out that i 'm using a 1.5a adapter instead of 2.0a adapter . maybe if i use a 2.0 , the drive will get enough power and wont suck up the touchpad 's power .
yes i can access to tty1 now what to please help me any one
i have flashplugin-installer installed . though this may have been after i found that adobe had a serious security flaw and updated it . i 'll have to keep an eye on it . hopefully all is well now .
ok , because of oldfred , i just started from scratch . thanks everyone for your time .
thanks for the comments guys , well for one he knows nothing of linux and two he says that ubuntu is not suitable for a small business and should stay on home computers . then he goes on about 92 % of the world is using windows and where can you find ubuntu linux experienced people in the uk ? ? well i work in croydon , no more than 6 miles up the road is canonical uk hq . sad thing is he still has vista on his laptop and is just updating to windows 7 .
to fix this
to many word for me to write in this box : < +11k
i am referring to the novell authentication screen being implemented into ubuntu . i figure i will just build a front-end for fusedav or ncpfs because i ca n't seem to find anything that does that .
: though i would have to greatly trim and change the output of that command because it says too much , all i need and want on the hour is something like ( ` [ time ] ` replaced with the hour ) : `it is now [ time ] o'clock`
edit : could not solve the problem . after 7 years , i am going back to windows .
i just did a new download of the 64bit ( i had 32 before ) and a reinstall of the entire os and everything is working now . not sure what the issue was , but because i still had n't moved my copied files , it seemed like the easiest/fastest solution .
yes , evolution 3.16 , which i use in fedora 21 is much faster with ms exchange ( ews ) accounts compared to the one that comes in with 14.04 lts .
thanks can i ask something else..will i have to use `` extended partition '' for swap or home..do they definitely have to be separate partition do n't they ? root - primary and ext 4 * swap primary and linux-swap file type * what will be `` home `` primary or extended ?
gcc version 4.8.4 ( ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04 ) this is the version of gcc i 'm using..
yes secure boot is enabled .
ubuntu 14.04. should have mentioned it . i do not think it is an intel issue because nothing in the firmware can possibly touch some file on some disk when the os is not even booted !
: uh , yes ? i have variable resolutions ...
i solved the problem by `` apt-get install '' . although i get from answer a more elegant way to fix it thanks !
: any pdf will demonstrate what i am talking about . @ sergio92pt : version 2.32.0 .

ok , i ran `fsck` and everything seems ok. i reinstalled xserver and the propietary radeon drivers and the gui is back . however , the integrity of the system seems heavily damaged , it keeps showing me messages about `` errors in the system '' to report , applications that ca n't be launched and the left and upper menus of the desktop disappearing . so , in this case what should be the optimal solution ? reinstall ubuntu from scratch ?
i copied /lib/lsb/init-functions into the /etc/init.d folder and renamed it to functions and it worked . thanks ! ! : )

my hotspot is setup over the wifi interface . i followed the simplest way to add it via the gui-based networking manager . i tried to connect an android 4.1.1 running on a samsung galaxy tab2 .
yes , this is a dual boot setup with uefi
that would be so on a full install . but on a stripped image , the list is only the ones that came preinstalled with it . therefore , no image viewer , video player , etc . i would need to have a list of those applications on a full install , not the one i 'm currently running . but thank you for your help !
one of the env variables missing is m2_home . i prefer idea to take the variables from the .bashrc instead of configuring the maven path manually .
i am sorry . i meant to write ubuntu developer tool center ( udtc ) .
it is kinda new actually ... but i will check it for dust , thanks for the suggestion !
so you are telling usermod will solve my problem ? is it ?
update : i deleted the ubuntu partitions ( ext and linux-swap ) and installed from .iso . the ubuntu installer recognized the empty partition ( without expressly saying so ) , and installed just fine . ubuntu 13.04 shows up in the load screen . windows ( 7 ) boots just fine . thanks for the help !
, `i do n't know how to use it . help me , in that issue` .
no , i eventually gave up . it does not overheat anymore so i do not care - now its cold : )
i got acer e1-531g and i have disabled the uefi option in the bios .
boot preference is good ; i will check the iso as i just downloaded it to the usb drive - i will check out unetbootin . thanks everyone .

first , i had a problem with installation until i deactivated nomodeset . then after installation i could not enter ubuntu before i add 'nomodeset ' to the grub editor . for 'slow ' , i see that animations are slow like fades .

the only time i ever need to unmount the device is to correct the renaming problem . i do that with the disks program by highlighting the `` volume '' and pushing the `` stop '' button furthest to the left along the bottom row . other than that i never need to mount or unmount the device since it automatically mounts whenever i initially start my computer .

correct , that 's what 's happening .

no , i did n't ; the question has almost 1k viewers , but not a solution : (
the application open with no lagging.i type code and run.after sometime its freeze with no response only we can minimize it . please give me some solution.as i was mentioned my ram was 2gb not 8gb .
should i run this command via terminal ? `host domain.ltd` ?
the additional drivers show an alert box when start `` failed to download their packages , please check the status of your network . many drivers are not available '' . and then with the additional drives opened , it shows no drivers and its written `` no proprietary drivers in use on the system '' .
yeh , im pretty sure that was it . had rstudio running all day and it did n't crash once plus i also noticed that there was significant improvement in the speed when editing files in rstudio . i use vim binding and in that 0.99.751 version vim editing was laggy as.. before rstudio would crash two three hours into runtime
how do i know ? this is a very new machine , only released in late 2013. does that help ?
frankly , i do n't know why i need that much space . however , i just want to try it out because hibernate is not working when i am running multiple programs such as eclipse , texstudio . without those programs , hibernate works just fine .
-- - `/usr/share/ati/fglrx-install.log` shows that check if system has the tools required for installation . fglrx installation requires that the system have kernel headers . /lib/modules/3.8.0-33-generic/build/include/linux/version.h can not be found on this system . one or more tools required for installation can not be found on the system . install the required tools before installing the fglrx driver . optionally , run the installer with -- force option to install without the tools . forcing install will disable amd hardware acceleration and may make your system unstable . not recommended .
i specified the core dump to be placed in a different folder , so it 's not in /tmp .
yes , thanks ! ! it 's intel actually . sorry , i was a bit confused . there is no ethernet port on the laptop which causes the problem . so , i have to do it offline . hopefully , that would be possible ? thanks so much ! ! !
the goal is not to just to clear the term , it 's how to get the system to automatically do it for me . i do n't like having to manually erase the last term used every time , especially if it was n't useful . one problem this causes is , if the term only returned files , then all subsequent terms also only return files ( i am using recoll-scope ) . i must hit 'esc ' to fully clear it , before i 'm able to search for an app .
edit : sometimes they seem to work , sometimes notting happens . i can turn on the lights using fn + f4 and by repeadetly clicking fn + f3 and f4 , they will eventually turn off . wtf

oh , sorry i 've forgotten to mention that . i 'm using ubuntu 12.10 .
edit : this is really bizarre . ten minutes ago , the terminal app was opening consistently in the top left corner . now it 's the bottom right . i did n't log out , restart , or mess with the application settings at all . i feel like ubuntu is playing a sick joke on me .
i need to collect dummy packets data . it is better to increase its rate .

it 's an intel 3160
the main reason is dropbox . i need to autostart the dropbox daemon that is user-specific . i tried some tutorials i found in internet , but they appear to be only for ubuntu server , and they do n't seem to work in my configuration .

about the connection , i have been told so by the house owner . by looking at the modem i read wlan ( green ) , 3g ( off ) , internet ( green ) , 4g ( green ) . i 'm in sweden since two weeks , i did n't have time to check what kind of connection it is . as for the command , there was another one to run right after i did n't reported since i got the error i posted .
i do n't have a directory in /opt/google actually the opt is some wierd gzip that i tried to open with `gzip -d opt.g` & `sudo gunzip opt.gz` and it told me that no such file exists.i put a screen in the main post

no , i deleted the { 3 } , is there a possibility to replace all that character which not a-z a-z 0-9 and _ with sed ?
as stated in the question , the bookmarks are just urls containing `/u/0` , `/u/1` , etc . chrome magically maps these to accounts . my two instances of chrome have different mappings . changing the order on one box will screw up the order on the other . _yes thank you i have managed bookmarks before._ : p
i just followed your instructions

wps 9.1 it seems to be updated but i do n't care . my major problem now is that i ca n't update my system because any apps that i tryed to install , fail .
as mentioned i can not run the upgrade command . it is asking for 24gb of space . it is a 4gb flashdrive that i run ubuntu from .

thanks for all the help ! i saw your answers yesterday , upvoted a couple , but will read through them properly today . i might not be able to accept all of them , since i want to keep some of the questions open in case others might find out other stuff . thanks again **= ) **

that 's what i get when i try `lvchange -ay data/shared` ... . `.device-mapper : table : 252:0 : sdb1 too small for target : start=384 , len=3907026944 , dev_size=3902853120` . @ psusi sorry i was n't able to try it before .
not sure how i check this , but this is what wine configuration says under the `` audio '' tab : `` selected driver : winealsa.drv '' . under defaults , all default audio devices are selected . `` test sound '' works like it should , and will actually sound whilst any other application also emits sound .
i will try the solutions given in the posts later , thank you for your help .

oh.. yes . it 's there . i 'm sorry i 'm totally noob . what do i need to do ?
the server is hosted at linode.com , i ssh to the box to manage , change , and do everything , so i need ssh for now . i added an iptables rule to block the /24 address from china . but i need to be more secure and not worry about hackers so much .
i am not getting any errors just paste does n't work . sorry i ca n't give more details as i very new to this and the command line is a bit daunting at the moment .

the `` back '' and `` install now '' buttons are grayed out in the 14.04 installer .
i do n't know . how would i establish something like that ? i have inquired and found that : 'glxinfo | grep direct ' returns the same error as above , which is alarming .
i have finally solved it by following the instructions given in the link you posted . thank you so much ! pd : how to select best answer ?
poweroff command actually powers off computer . did n't know this command . thanks for that .
it`s game through wine emulator , how should i find the title bar ?
the installer i have is 32 bit
that 's an excellent consideration , moving a drive or an array .
it happens even if i watch it in windowed mode , and is in no way related to switching between fullscreen and windowed mode . it just happens periodically by itself .
no , not debs , i mean i have a repository in my computer ( _not a full repository_ ) . yes , right-clicking a local deb was not also successful in oneiric . but i do n't check that in precise . ( i am using precise now )
no . i do n't have rabbitmq .
this is not exactly my computer ( family ) , so i ca n't check it right now , but i remember that it was `kt266a/ata 133/ atx` chipset which came with `ati radeon 9600/9550/x1050 series` . most important thing is that catalyst does n't support it ( from the first link ) .
both pcs have windows 7 ultimate , hard disks are formated at ntfs , but usb stricks are fat32 ( i use quick format to fat32 before i make live usb )

i am still testing it to see if it worked . it 's now unclear if the issue is bluetooth related or what ... strange behavior today .
i have edited my question does it make more sense now ?
because , from what i can gather , this feature was n't present in ubuntu 12 and needed a workaround .
i am currently running ubuntu 13.04 and the nano version is 2.2.6
i should also note that the same code works on a mac .
yes exactly . i am using filezilla and the error showing that password is incorrect.but i checked that password is correct . using the same password the user can login via terminal on the same server .
i use ubuntu 12.04
nope , it just vanishes
no i guess ... i 've another server with the same configuration and when i make the same test ( open the same page many times ) apache does not create many process .
i put my hardware information in the question content .
thanks sir for the reply , uhmm i tried crossover yesterday , the same problem happened also
: it is behind a router .
that would be nice
oh i did not know it was for free i saw it for sale on ebay , and it was a typo its called whelen and i ca n't live without it actually , like i said its for work . but thank you anyways .
i choose that option , but then that screen came and nothing changed since then , did n't look like anything is installing as i had the mouse cursor free to use
this is all local traffic . would , using `ssh` , help solve my problem or just add an extra layer of complexity ?

i would like to run a `r-script` on daily basis .
edit : to answer some questions , i 'm `ssh`ing into ubuntu from osx . i 'm using iterm and zsh . i also forgot to mention that i 'm using tmux on the ubuntu machine .
yes , my girlfriend 's mac has no problem connecting to that particular network . it is recognised and can be connected to
hjalmarsson yes , i 've also checked that . there are other short-cut keys . a few of them involve the shift key , but all in the form shift + some other keys . there is no short-cut setting of only the shift key .
pretty fast it 's just as it normally would be
yes , it does . no issues at all .
i can create a file with `` touch foo.txt `` , but it says something that translates to `` set the time for `` foo.txt '' : operation not permitted `` . `` foo.txt `` still appears , though . that error did n't pop up before this whole cut & paste ; thing !
when i boot up withthe disc in the drive the computer hangs there and does not boot up . i also tried to insert disc once the computer was started up and tried to boot from there but nothing happened . i opened the files on the disc and clicked on wubi.exe , which then gives three options i chose the install ubuntu option and when i click on reboot now it does not respond
no , i mean suspend .

i 'm not sure i understand your question `` which wireless is 'build ' in ? what exactly do you mean ?
`` i would prefer to just use aptitude , but unfortunately the versions i need are n't available yet. ``
: `` maybe '' is still not confirming , any useful sources would be welcome .
thanks for the quick responses !
it is beyond me how one can critique a question when not having properly understood it , @ redanimalwar . `` always on top '' is a setting for *a single window* , while i am looking for the behaviour to be globally applied and in a different fashion . clearly you have never used the above settings .
( i 'm using 12.10 )
, @ chaos , @ guntbert , @ davidfoerster , @ braiam : my original question was edited . did you put on hold that one , or the edited one ?
first point of ubuntu philosophy = `should have the freedom to download , run , copy , distribute , study , share , *change* and improve their software for any purpose , without paying licensing fees.` seems like unity is part of ubuntu , so you would think that you would be able to `change` basic features of unity , like the placement of the launcher , top , bottom , left , or right . i 'm thinking the ubuntu philosophy needs to be updated ?
when running `./test.sh` while in my home directory , i am prompted for a password .

thank you for your reply . i updated my post .
i have n't tried that . do you mean format the disk as ext3 and try reinstalling the os ?
apparently , pam_kwallet.so is something optional for kubuntu ( [ commenting out those optional lines removes the errors , but did n't solve the problem . i also installed xubuntu and xfce to see if it would work , but did n't . : (

no why did you ask that ? ..i want to do a asynchornous execution of muiple scripts

what can i do with them ?
great idea - just tried , but it did n't worked . basically , keys are different under linux , and it does not copy on left mouse , and does not insert on right . in fact i have n't found any way to copy/paste on putty in linux at all : -d

it 's actually not even a file , but an empty folder . when i have this issue in windows i usually use a program called unlocker , but i do n't think linux has anything similar .
yes when i retry recommended repair it stuck again
i updated the question with more information .
i just reinstalled ubuntu and the files went like that !
the exe file ( sphinx3_align ) is part of package sphinx3 tool , after run sphinx3 tool copy sphinx3_align from usr/local/bin to shared folder , but when i open in windows the file not defind .
, the downloaded file is `collabnetsubversionedge-4.0.10_linux-x86.tar.gz` .
there 's only one entry in my `/etc/shadow` , but there 's another file called `/etc/shadow-` is that supposed to be there ?

how do i check ?
hmm i have tested it now and it seems to be flash related . but strange is that it also always happen when i open unity dash - everytime . really confusing ...
you are right about that , i 'm sorry.i do n't think you are psychic i just dont remember the errors.as i said i 'm new so i thought there 'll be a command that installs these packages.anyway i ran sudo reboot and i dont see any errors ... so i guess these missing packages do n't affect the system
i am putting 2 gb ram

automatic every time . it was set up with ubuntu desktop , but now i wan na lower the runlevel and put it in a corner somewhere .
i do n't mean the wordpress control panel , but a web host 's control panel with an admin and users for the website . the wordpress control panel is something that comes with it after you install all of the files .
wellthe schedule is set to `` daily '' so i expected dja-dup to run as soon as i wake up my computer .

i hear the disk spinning , and the led turns on . i dont know if its the adapter or not .
i do have a separate home partition but i was hoping there would be an easier solution .
my question was not whether it is a good idea , only how it 's achievable . there could be any number of very valid reasons , really . for the purpose of this discussion , let 's just say it 's for improved ext4 performance and stability is dispensable .
yes , it is supported..
sorry . i finally compiled it from scratch on a new vps , but your solution seems pretty good . thank you !
.. i 'm pretty sure that my hardware supports monitor mode , because monitor mode works great in windows.. but using windows is not an option since i primarily need monitor mode for using aircrack-ng ...
nope , firefox is the default for `` regular '' websites . ubuntu browser is the default just for webapps . firefox works ok , the problem is just for webapps . i know , i could just forget about them and just use ff , but i think it would be nice to use them since they are available ...
okay ... . anything specific on what info ?

i 've added the output of `nvidia-settings` to the question .
thank you for all the answers but i am good now !
thanks again . 2. the sort you just gave me . maybe a list of issues that may occur or something like that . things to look out for that are not described in the major tutorials , but people realize after using the system for some years . depends on the experience as i am not sure if i really want to switch to dual-boot . 3. though so , as well .

yes
oh ok i 'll give it a look , thanks : )
error on exutable bit is `` bash : ./gridwars : permission denied '' , not `` not a dynamic executable ''
hello , are you referring to the apache error log ? here it is , do you thinkg it has something to do with line number 4 on this pastebin ? i am just new in maintaining a vps , thank you .
windows was installed by default in uefi .
the same issue comes when i use windows to do the formatting .
in mint i was using mintupdate , here in xubuntu i 've got installed : update-manager , and i suppose gnome software center and i want to replace them by mintupdate .
i got it working again by changing everything back to the default . that , however , does not solve my problem of changing the directory . one important piece of information is that i am accessing the mysql database with webmin , but simply changing directories with webmin prevents the mysql databse from starting . another issue is that the original data directory has `` mysql - mysql server '' as the folder owner , but when i follow the copying instructions i become the owner of the directory .
, logs added as well as `postconf -m` just in case it 's helpful
thank you for your reply . my system was lacking updated driver . i installed it & now its working .
oh , it does actually ! there 's a little crackling when it starts playing , but sounds fine otherwise . i guess the problem with tuxguitar output is elsewhere .
also , it looks like it might be possible to do this ( at least for one specific file ) using git :
ip6tables -l is clean
. what 's the reason and how can i fix that ?
yes you 're right , thank you ! ! if you post it as an answer , i 'll accept it .
why does ubuntu mount partitions ? what is the purpose ? does it happen in windows ?
okay i 'll update . tried netflix through browser and app . installed firefox user agent overrider . says i need a newer version of chrome or firefox and/or silverlight .
nope , i did it on boot screen but it stay black . i tried when it was purple and changed nothing too .
both via the software center and via a .deb file which i downloaded from their site . if i open the .deb file , i get this error : internal error : the file /home/niklas/hmtningar/steam_latest.deb could not be opened .
no , i did n't do it . right now i 'm running apache under my user , so it 's working , but i 'd like to run it under another user for security reasons .
, i 'm installing it on parallels 5. would like to avoid using guest additions . all i need is to change the screen resolution .
it is uefi , yeah i know about that new windows licencing thing . i have new licence ready if i need to change that .
i also tested using ssh and virtualbox and i got the same problems .
yes , libreoffice is the only one being so slow . i do n't use many gui applications , but all of them work fine : among them firefox , adobe reader , evince , gedit , and rstudio . all of them work smoothly .
i upgreaded java and that solved that problem but now i am getting `` address already in use '' error . i posted a question here please let me know if you have any suggestions .
yeah i do n't know why . i really do n't understand what 's going on . i 've updated the font cache but ... . *sigh*
because it 's avoidable and not _that_ resource intensive . it means a tradeoff between machine and human resources . i prefer machines doing the work .
according to previous posts i 've found , such as - ? t=2235778 and - ? t=2240631 i need the 8812au driver in order to get wireless access from my netgear a6100 . this would be great sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential git git clone cd ~/rtl8812au_8821au_linux make sudo make install sudo modprobe 8812au except i ca n't install anything via this route because i do not have a temporary ethernet connection .
, yes it is 26.0 .
yes . i am able to mount the hdd . my primary hdd is also internal .
i always use the one opened by `crontab -e` in the terminal . which one is it ?
thank you for your reply . it is working now when i had shutdown windows and restarted using ubuntu
because i often use it that way being the reasoun i can run command without always writing password ..
it is a file within usr/share folder - i do have root privileges ( i do know the password ) but not sure you can start the gui with root rights ? and thanks for the encouragement - this is the 2nd time i am trying linux and i know that persistence has its rewards , this time i 'm sticking with it but i understand why it 's not mainstream yet : - ) - thank you
as a matter of fact , no .
thanks . `` snapshot '' is the [ official term ] ( for an `` larger update '' which includes all previous updates of an distribution . since it the libreoffice issue occurred after such a `` snapshot '' ( not an update ) it should be specified . * [ here ] ( you can find more specific explanations ( german ) .
nope , when i do this sound continues to not work and in the sound settings area hdmi is not listed as an output until i re-plug the hdmi cable . sometimes i have to re-plug the cable a few times

yes i did find , just rename the quick connect to any name if your choice , and you are done .
i have not used a set -e in my script , but i think that is the issue . i explicitly wrote a set +e in my script , and now if the build command fails i get the `` build failure '' echo . i guess the $ build_cmd script would be doing a set -e as part of its code .

well i want to install the driver for the pce-n15 this is the driver i 've been downloading .
because i had already installed onto the hard drive .
no just 3 occurrence .
not possible right now ( unless there 's a way to do it with an ipad ... ) . i have tried to loop back on the server though : `james @ case : ~ $ smbclient -l //192.168.1.106` `enter james 's password : ` `session setup failed : nt_status_cant_access_domain_info`
well i just wanted to try it out first tim . this is my first attempt at using linux .
i 'm quite sure it 's the other way around if they are at all duplicates . my question was asked in 2011 while the other was asked in 2015. the question also references this one and explains why it 's not the same .
it says : no such file or directory .
[ ! [ enter image description here ] [ 1 ] ] [ 1 ] [ 1 ] :
no files whatsoever there , aisde from applications.place and files.place . by the way , i just found out that the ghost lens can be replaced above or below the other lenses , but not above the worskpace switcher nor the launchers .
ok then . feel free to close the question .
yes i am .
how do i copy my files as root ?
they 're organized numerically @ serg , if that 's what you mean . if i go to the top directory , there 's folders s0001 - s2000 in order . and jacob , i have to have separate directories because the program i will be using for the 2000 tasks writes an identically named output for each job and i need every unique output file for each set in input parameters . the submission of each job is identical from file to file , but i have to separate the files somehow .
: added above .
sda6 : boot sector info : grub2 ( v1.99-2.00 ) is installed in the boot sector of sda6 and looks at sector 663659074 of the same hard drive for core.img , but core.img can not be found at this location . sda7 : boot files : /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/grub.cfg /etc/fstab /boot/grub/i386-pc/core.img yes , i update grub , but useless..i copy this info made by `` grub-repair '' , the problem is the grub generated by `` grub-repair '' ca n't find windows loader or it kills windows loader
i did not @ mote . i wrote out the list of things i would need to figure out how to do to perform the steps i would need to take . i 'm still working on it , but i would say it 's `` two weeks out ''
i 'm trying to downgrade many packages in an offline pc . i have the .deb files of those packages
it has uefi but i think it was running a `` legacy '' mode in order to run windows . i tried t install ( and restart ) ubuntu both in legacy and uefi mode without succeeding .
seems like it 's the uid=1000 , gid=1000 options
yes . i just installed it .
i will update my question with this info as soon as i can . but the fans seem to work fine . it blow a lot ...
, @ stefano , as i stated , i simply want to use mozilla 's default small icons . in the image you can notice the back/forward , new tab and refresh buttons are not the same as found in the preinstalled firefox .
i just copy pasted that code from a website and modified according to my script : )
thank you , but can you let me know to which boot device needs to be selected
- read the annoyingly small captions - the first ( without a proper window ) only occurred when it was not connected to the internet , making me suspect it was connecting in the background when it could connect to the internet - after auto removing most of the packages it opens properly in a browser window . i installed from the daily ppa as that seemed to be the most recommended and update - that probably was not a bright idea : ) . i will thoroughly check for any remaining packages , but i think the installed packages left pieces that was not removed when they were removed .
- note the part where i said `` i did *not* run that command ( i checked my bash history ) '' : - ) `` nginx '' does n't appear there at all .
app is proprietary . google princexml . try to generate hebrew .
my main reason was that gnome shell looked like gnome classic due to lack of video drivers ( i suspected , and have now confirmed ) , but also that games were simply unplayable
added system info to op , cheers
( in natty , by right clicking i could find `profile` or something like that . )
yes !
is this possible ?
i know that is long , process but i really need windows with access to disk . thank you for your response .
some of them have similar name and some do n't
built it myself so its custom ; which parts were you concerned about ?
this is a wubi install .
damn . i was worried about that .
i 'm running the 12.10 beta , upgraded from 12.04. i 've made sure that is n't muted .
well i ca n't take a screenshot anymore but there was a toggle somewhere to turn webapps off , and i clicked on that , thinking it was something else ( i realised afterwards it was that ) , but now the program wo n't start anymore . i have n't removed anything after the time that it worked .
because python is not my fort
i do n't think so . i 'm not sure in ubuntu where to monitor temp , but i did watch the cpu usage and it never exceeded 40 % on either core . also , as i commented on an answer below , it seems to be fine now that i 'm not transferring large amounts of data .
i 'm using the official beta .

. no , just ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 as stated
the internal webcam worked flawlessly in ubuntu 14.04.
ohh , do you know where that goes ? i was not aware of this .
as far as i know , there 's still no way to do this . i wish someone would make a customization tool for the magic mouse .
yes ubuntu . php version 5.5.9 .
there is no application in `` select application '' !
already tried it with xfwm4 -- replace but it does n't last after logging off .
thanks @ steeldriver , the password does not have any special characters . but my wifi is up now and hence not wasting much time looking into this .

i am using a 64 bit system with nvidia geforce gt 540 graphics card . the proprietary nvidia drivers can not be used , because then my gui login gets stuck . so , i am currently using nvidia-current from the repositories .
edit : more info . the multiplier i referred to ( and i probably used the wrong word ) is the cpu clock ratio . changing it to 6x , changes the cpu clock ( as reported by the bios ) to 2.00ghz ( 333mhz x6 ) . it seems to me that the cpu temperatures are cooler now , since i changed it , so i think it is running slower - but still it is reported as 2.83ghz in ubuntu
thank you . i have created public and private keys . however there is a control panel ( see my screenshot ) in the web interface of the western digital . can/should i use this and copy-paste anything ? would that make it easier for me to rsync without giving password ?
how do i get to a command line with ctrl+alt+f2 ? tried pressing it from the boot menu and during install and nothing happened . video card is an asus gtx 770 .
, yes !
unfortunately , no . but i am not looking for it any more , so there could exist something i am not aware of . feel free to investigate and eventually answer this question .
thanks for the edit . i left off the `` under ubuntu '' part of the title because we try not to overuse it in question titles , but maybe this question needed it . : /
i do not care about dual graphics , i just want to use the gtx 960m
i tried the wc -l *pdb and it showed me that two files were empty . i did n't know that was possible . but quite smart : ) thanks to both of you !

if i had to choose one , the usb adapter would be it . i first had the problem without the adapter and that 's why i bought it .
are you asking for my system specs ?
logs specifying that a new user has been created .
never used it before so if you have some documentation to look at i will give it a shot
i 'm not sure what you 're getting at . i have 100 % in my linux-swap line , and it means that swap should use 100 % of my ram size , which it does . then the next partition says the max size should be 100gb , but instead it uses the entire rest of the disk . so , with this partman scripts , i should be getting a 64gb swap partition and a 100gb / partition . instead i get a 64gb swap and an 8tb / . i do n't see how the 100 % is relevant to the question because that part is working as designed . i do n't want to specify swap size , that defeats the purpose .
output added , mka appears to be a bash function ?
i 'm using the working network now ( the one at home , so should i still run that command and post the output ? ) or does using a working network not make a difference here .
well , i switched from windows & how would you get your @ , euro sign , equal sign , slash sign ? ? ?

fyi , i 'm running xubuntu from a flash drive on the same computer . but i stopped and booted from the hard drive into recovery , root prompt and then ran the command from there as you wrote it and the output was `` no such file or directory . '' i then rebooted into xubuntu , opened a terminal and ran it with the path to the partition on the hard drive and the output was :
[ i was recommended to this [ ] thread , but that does not solve my problem . so i go `` sudo -i gedit /usr/share/applications/name.desktop '' then [ desktop entry ] type=application terminal=true name=scid icon=/home/lakis01/schach/scid_vs_pc-4.13/icons/scid.png exec= ? the problem is i do n't know , what is the proper executable to link to . i the terminal i just type scid , but there is no file called scid.xxx in the program folder . so i have running all executables via right-click in that directory , but nothing happened .

i was prompted to add a root password , which worked once it was installed before the restart .
i upvoted your answer and im sure it would have worked ; i reinstalled my whole system . i have had some other problems , too . this ( oviously ) fixed it for me .
your command syntax is unfamiliar to me . normally when using the advanced package tool it is `` apt-get '' . can you elaborate ?
i mean that after setting debug=0 and debug=1 there was no change . there were no errors after making the change.the syslog was still filling with entries every second . this does not happen in mint so something is different with ubuntu .

. video conversion in this case compresses the container file . ( avi etc ) the container file itself already contains the audio file , plus at least also the video file and in some cases an subtitle file . so by converting that you contain the audio file but compress the original audio file . thus breaking open the container and retaining the original audio file , makes the end result a bit better . ( however my case is solved . but not by using any solutions given here , unfortunately . ) i hope my answer helps you understand the difference between 1 and the other : d
no update today ( or the last few days ) .
gnome applet would be best but stand alone software is also a good solution .

no it 's not that . i know because every time there is different updates and i do install them . then later in the day there will be some more different updates again . this is how i know it is checking for updates .

because i have two screens and without installing nvidia drivers ( which needs to stop x server ) they do n't work .

it is java program
i found an answer . i installed compiz config settings manager and ran ccsm . i then enabled the unity plugin . this seems like a bug to me . i tried posting this in the `` answer '' but apparently i 'm not allowed to .

is checking an iso with a gpg verified md5sums file different from checking with gpg , when checking for verification that it has n't been changed since canonical published it ?
it is n't , becouse i can type uppercase w without any problem . and xev can read lowercase input also .

( was already activated ) . - i have tried to reset the user files . - tried to reinstall everything ( .iso and os ) . none of those worked for me .
it is in the post ( i see that some mod edited it ) .
how do i do that ? i added `` gnome-settings-daemon '' to the start up applications list ( it was n't there before ) made some changes & rebooted . changes got reset again .

hi , i had posted a perfectly fine solution and somehow it got removed . i do n't know the exact details anymore , but i think i used the program boot-repair from the live cd . this solution was given in the documentation : if you want i can re-answer my question ...
most recently i pre-formatted the drive with gparted on a livecd , aligning to mib , and then used the created partitions to install the os
i mean actually disabled . like , i have to right-click on the nm-applet and click `` enable networking . ''

an app is able to use and configure a printer . so if an app can choose a printer , and that printer is set up a particular way , it does not place any further feature requirements on the app itself . the question is why apps are not using printers ' defaults
nice link . will try and give it a go with a virtual device set up , but i was actually trying to know if it was possible to use the flashcache device the exact way in which intel srt works , in that my entire os partition , with installed apps and boot files etc is completely cached and gets speeded up . do you know if this can be done ? how to ?
but the folder in the example above is created
from the web gui , i attempted to add a subnet , entered the above information in the web form and tried to submit it . the error message does n't tell me anything about what might be wrong with it .

i was able to solve the problem simply by restarting my computer . everything was smooth from there . thanks .
yes is like 'dead ' and not terminated by the server ! how can i fix that again ?
it is still not fixed .
it keeps saying i have no installation candidates , and i dont know how to fix broken packages and i ca n't remove the wine and re-download because it was never installed !
thanks grimpitch -- no , i used the synaptic package manager .
**more information** it is not a single drive , but several different drives that are mounted only when needed , not permanently . therefore , `/etc/fstab` would not be appropriate . if there is n't a solution to this , i shall simply change the scripts to move the mount point to my home folder in `~/mnt` .
: i booted first dhcp then changed to static .
with natural scrolling you mean the direction you slide with your fingers with a touchpad i suppose . well , it 's comparable with the smooth stepless scrolling of some touchpads ( especially on macs ) . the video in the comment before yours shows it well . stepless scrolling allows you to control scrolling accurate to one pixel if needed in an intuitive way and is not confusing while reading . you need a mouse with a little extra button or a touchpad to use this .
edit : it started happening after i install all the dependencies needed to setup an environment to work on the ubuntu summit website . i 'm assuming something i installed must not have played nice with the rest of my system .

ateros does n't work properly but i can connect internet with external wifi adapter and wire connection
i 'm trying to use ubuntu with the less possible footprint that i 'm using it . i 'd like to only boot ubuntu if i use my pendrive , and if the pendrive is not plugged in that everything will be as always . this is because we are not supposed to change anything on that computer . another option could be to install ubuntu in another partition but without boot , and then boot it from the usb , but i ca n't seem to find something about neither .
bc i do n't want the window minimized , both windowminimize and windowkill ( which kills the process ) do n't work for me here
yes , that was primary problem , when i added the ntfs partition into fstab , everything started working
how come the same rule was blocking ( as you can see in my question ) gbs of traffic but after some days the same rule did n't block any traffic ? my server was all fine when iptable was showing that it 's blocking traffic . however , my server is slow while iptable shows little traffic is blocked . i checked iftop and it shows lots of traffic coming from the attacker 's ip .
ok , i will use google translator okay ?
. come to think of it , even if you somehow remove that entry , one could boot from a live-cd , get a `chroot` up and running , and then add another user , with the right privileges that allows it to muck everything up
since it has installed properly , there must be , but i can not access it because i can not see anything .
i tried deleting the game data , and that did nothing . ctrl+alt+f1 also did nothing after the crash , but for some reason my laptop refused to turn back on for a bit afterwards when i tried that command
and i am trying to install unity tweak ,
i included output in my question , windows is n't hibernated , now i do n't know if it says dynamic
**note : ** in the f4 modes menu , i only see the 'normal mode ' .
edit : i 'm come to realize two things : 1 . `` amazon '' is not a web app but rather a web shortcut , that i can delete . 2. apparently the canonical/ubuntu and referral code situation is n't new and received some bad press in the day . i certainly do not wish to re-open any can of worms and am more than happy with this question 's closure/deletion .
it would then be reachable from dash like any other lens such as file , music , ..
1 ) ubuntu 12.04 2 ) went to the armory website , downloaded tar.gz , un-packed it and followed the installation instructions on the website .
; so as to have files of each step of the course . as it is required of me to modify the program using the lessons topic ; the first thing i do is copy and rename the files . the script is supposed to copy each file making a duplicate file names , changing only the required sequential number ; following my standard nomenclature : e.g . 16117p-foobar.c is changed to 17120p-foobar.c ... etc . the new number is specified by the user ( my self only ) by way of the second command line parameter , it is not automated in the script
yes.. hp laptop ! !
it has n't got an update since 2010 , going by although , it should probably work . i will check and post tomorrow .
i have done a complete reinstall of ubuntu and it is the exact same , external mouse and keyboard working fine . i feel like it is the drivers .
to @ fiksdal : generally packages , my friend ...
with pleasure @ ron .
: what is the command i can type in on the command line to run the network manager ?
thanks . you raised a good point . i should check the connection from the other side as well .
i simply changed the default dm manager to lightdm after installing lightdm , obviously
well , that 's currently a problem for me : $ home is encrypted and usually it 's decrypted and mounted during boot . but , from the recovery console , it does n't appear that $ home has been decrypted . if i could get into $ home then at this stage i 'd probably just back everything up off there and install the new lts 16.04 version .
hi @ oli , i can not right click it , but i can run other programs ok , but program shows up very slow .
edit : i was able to get an answer to this question , however i was informed that this was the wrong place to post it . thank you for the help and sorry for the incorrect location for posting it .

sorry about that , i 'm trying to update to a new version . 9.10 is the system i 'm using now . computers are not my thing .
pereir-the answer given by `huckle` is impressive . but i 've same concern again that why ca n't linux bundle whole this bunch of commands into a dedicated recovery tool . make that tool generic and allow all the linux flavor to implement it as per their need and specific requirement .
no i dont know how i open file ?

the resolution is set to 1366x649 but i also tried to reset it to the original resolution of my laptop 1366x768 and after the restart , it displayed the same smartphone-like behavior . any suggestions ?
you 're right . i modified it now .
it 's ' @ as [ ] ' ( because i have - without any effect - disabled the command under `` settings > keyboard > shortcuts '' and with the dconf editor . )
i found this question offering [ manual installation steps ] ( ) , so if there 's no existing ppa , i can use that .
if not nautilus itself , are there any alternates that may help accomplish this ?
edit as the `dh_make` did not do itself but can be found in the docs [ here ] ( # install ) , i made an install-file in the /debian directory containing the files to be moved . after a `debuild -s` there was a subdirectory named like the package created , and in its tree structure ( like the destination described in the install file ) the files were placed . so i guess it will work on a regular install . only one more question : how can i set `chmod+x` to those installed files ?
jobin i have super user priveleges .
of course !
i have want to use user themes for gnome shell , but i am having troubles . i installed the user theme extension , but it does n't appear to show up under the gnome tweak tool . to confirm that i have the user themes extension installed , here is the feedback i get when i try to install it through terminal again :

you are right and thank you but it is not everytime it was the first two times and only on that website with js enabled ! ? is n't that suspecious ? furthermore it has english and chinese language mixed within the same sentences ?

note that the script of this job divides the job into 4 steps to run in parallel since each step needs 2 thread that run in parallel on one machine , now i need to use more than one machine to run the same script in which to let a threads to perform the parallelism using all theses machines by using this command : ./script.py '100 digits number ' slaves.hostnames=hostname1 , hostname2 , hostname3 -- slaves 4 -- client-threads 2 the above number is number that i need to factor using all these machines to decrease the overall execution time .
i usually do that . just thought i would save time and all the unnecessary installs .
i have it installed but not activated .
nope , would you care to explain ?
do you have any other sata controller ? and do you have the _exact_ same errors ?
i have edited the question to include the output of rfkill list .
no the ubuntu page does n't allow explicit installers for wubi acc . to system architectures . however if my system is capable of 64 bit then i want to install 64 bit ubuntu . however i think , i 'll try your suggestion . btw do u think that i should try the `` avoid md5 sum check '' option . maybe then it will not download the meta files ?
i do n't think so . it 's always in kbs , and i have 4 gb ram . so i do n't think that 's the problem .
yes . i hooked it up to windows 8 , and i can read & write files . it works via windows 7 too . so i know the drive is fine .
**update** : if i boot with the live usb and press escape in the `` try/install '' menu , the `` crub > '' cli is presented and typing `` exit '' here leads to the grub menu and i can select the installed ubuntu and use it . but would hate to use the live usb everytime i need to boot into ubuntu .
well , i just got a new laptop , which is a acer aspire r 15 , and it is running windows 10. i just got it today . my intentions were to partition the hard drive , and make ubuntu my main operating system , and just use windows periodically whenever i needed to . i am new to computers , as my specialty are smart phones . so i am learning as i go . i developed a passion for linux after i used it a few times on my cousins computer .

problem with using sfdisk is that it does not list the free space because it does not have an id . after stuffing around for a long time i had to give up and reinstall . which is a bit sad because i am interning at a neuroscience institute that have terrible coding practices and will have to go through the tedium that is installing all their libraries . on the upside i am scripting it all and will give it to them for the sake of their new interns ! any data i need was on git/dropbox or whatever apart from experimental code . thanks for the answers guys !

added the -vvv output . vps is openvz . like i said , the other machine connects to it without a hitch .
no . neither works yet .
no , i have n't built it . that 's the problem . i do n't know how to build it .
i would like to know what happens but i 'm not actively searching for an answer .
no , no passphrase !
update : [ this ] ( ) question is different from mine , because the ssh command is not generated by me , so the solution to that question does not solve my question . the ssh command is generated and executed by a script inside a library i am using . i do not prefer to modify that script to change the command as i am not completely aware of how that script works .
hi thanks for the fast replies - just took off for work - @ nick excellent suggestion will have those specs later tonight - basics are ( quad core but i think its dual core with multi processing ) i5 and gpu nvidia 750 ti . 5 drives no ssd 's . ubuntu on its own drive .
i did n't tried with 13.10 , but i used elementary os luna and it did n't work either
see if u can check now
: oh right , sorry , a lot was happening and i forgot to do that !
sergey - sure . system / preferences / appearance , then `` customize '' , then `` colours '' . zetah - oh , good question . it happens in audacity . but other programs seem to be okay . i 'm running maverick .
i was watching youtube and the sound went out .
re : the selection options , just has one option i.e . `x screen 0` . re : stereo , there seems to be lot of options for it like hdmi3d , color interleaved , horizontal interleaved etc .
: unfortunately i did n't , and finally had to reinstall the os .
well , i 'm working on ubuntu and when googled to find some method i found several similar answers here then .. i ask : d
just curious ; )
i did n't hear any sound from subwoofer , only from front speakers : (
i tried that . it said `` no matches found '' for the canon pixma mp780 . then the next window said the printer was either `` unplugged or turned off . '' still stuck . charles
i didnt put the exact command , because it happens on every installation , sudo apt-get install `` insert the package you want ''
so far is
$ echo $ java_home shows nothing . empty
/opt : regular file , no read permission
what command do you need me to use ?
no , i can not
i am not sure what it does , but i get an error `` fatal : option -m can not be combined with -c/-c/-f/ -- fixup . `` .
cheers @ rmano , that 's probably what i 'll end up doing . i was just hoping to find a nice piece of software that would help me organizing the lists .
yes it does . i could use that but it would be better to get de wifi out of the sleeping mode instead of restarting al networking
yes , why are you asking me : d ?
good point ; for this question , let 's use the three `` . `` , like `` ... '' , as this may be more difficult than one ellipsis character .
it does , but i would dimming to be stopped when i play a movie .
sftp exacly ! and how should i do that ?
what do you mean ? i want to have no ip address in any interface and i want to restore previous state after some actions .
yup ... ... ... ...

putting ubuntu on a usb ,
: i installed compiz , but i did n't enable that feature
i got a a couple of networkmanager error , and a kernel error . the kernel error says : nouveau [ pdisp ] invalid_value [ unk84 ] chid 0 mthd 0x0828 data 0x00002183 . notice that i was able to upgrade the system and install the nvidia 352 proprietary drivers ( i 've got a gt525m dedicated gpu )
what gui file ? thanks , i 'll try that first thing in the morning . wake on plan : i 've made a version ready to be click-packaged but these are not installable yet : i 'll try to do something about it on the weekend , thanks for asking : )
so far i am using a static ip setup for the wlan router ( eth0 ) .
no i 'm not using any proxy ...
i 've added the syslog in my post . as soon as i `` run '' the project on the emulator ( ctrl-r ) the system becomes completely unresponsive to input , what is displayed remains exactly how it was before trying to deploy and run the program .
no i have n't been able to install it ... i use radeon hd 6490m and my ubuntu is 64 bit . i tried to install it many times and had to reinstall ubuntu after it was broken after installing the ati config . do you know a clear way to fix this ? thanks .
official site :
it 's a fairly new machine , bought it in may of this year . it ca n't be a hard drive failure . it could be a kernel but bug . i 'm using kernel version 3.2.0-48 , but i get the same message with 3.5.x and 3.8.x .
i am not sure what the above does . i just want to remove all the files , from the paths that are returned when i run a locate command .
no i did not . i try .
update : it seems both my alt keys have stopped working entirely since the update . update : alt keys work fine with keyboard attached to a different machine . so keyboard itself is fine .
strings - yes , that is exactly what i am trying to achieve - for the 8192cu driver to be loaded at boot time . but , as can be seen from the output of `sudo lshw -c network` , the rtl8192cu driver is loaded instead
nah , same old storage drive i 've always used . could the storage drive be dead ? i did n't think i 'd get as far as ( successfully ) entering the encryption key if the storage drive was dead ...
ok but if i use torrents for movies i 'll get some virus
**edit** my phone is a droid x. i 'm using the latest os officially available for that phone .
in the inf file , there is a reference to xp as well as a bunch of others . also , i did sudo the modprobe command .
because when it scans , the connection literally lags .
virtual box
: ( 1 ) yes , i am actually using 12.10 and can upgrade to 13.04 if necessary . i updated the tag accordingly . ( 2 ) using external usb based nfc devices on ubuntu ( both intel and arm based ) works out of the box . however , my question is specific to the pn544 chip set built into the nexus device .
yes machine boot okay whenever i use live usb to boot even i reinstall still that problem
that 's it grammargeek ! thank-you .
no , i 'm trying to run the command `rm -rf ~/.wine-pipelight/* ; rm -rf ~/.wine-pipelight/./ . * ; cp -a ~/viewright_backup/ . ~/.wine-pipelight/` every time i start firefox .
all i can see is the background , a pink background . everything else is outside the screen . so if the tv has 1980x whatever matching it is like the screen simulate 2100 x whatever matching . i would need a -10 to 15 % scaling .
eg > when i type my email address ( i find : instead of @ ) , or when i write here `` > ( `` ( should be the smile )
is that really the preferred way to ask things here ? creating several `` topics '' ? that 's usually what gets people angry .
i does not matter if you run it with or without sudo - - same output .
i do n't know . i have upgraded from 10.04 to 11.04 , where i had python 2.6. could that be the reason ?
on my keyboard exist numpad , and i need alt+numpad . : )
i saw others models of pega gamepad running very well on linux but not my model yet . my model : runs on windows so i thought i would have no problem in linux
yes . opencl is not installed when i use additional drivers . i 've also tried a number of methods in the 3-page discussion of installing nvidia drivers . i have discovered that it is installed if i download and install the *.run file directly from nvidia so my primary problem is ( temporarily ) solved , but i 'd much prefer a semi-supported solution so the `` upgrade ... '' function provides some help about what to do when i move to 16.04 ( or whatever . ) opencl did install on 14.04 ( with get-apt ) but i no longer remember if i got the package from edgers or directly from ubuntu .
in really i do n't know , i read that it is possible to be running ubuntu on you pc and then press a keyboard combo that will put windows in your monitor , and you can be toggling os'es . i have never used virtualbox , but i think that virtual box puts windows in a window not ? but it can be , i do n't know a lot about virtualization .
my window os was in drive c and i formatted it , the ubuntu was on the drive `` e '' , but i can not access to ubuntu now ?
yes , i did sudo make install , but libcheese.so.8 fails . maybe i need to dig around in the make files for where libcheese.so.8 is exported . libcheese.so.7 is located in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcheese.so.7` on a non-source install
no , not solved . i 'll post the answer if i find it .
it is n't really hot or really noisy but it is still a bit noisier and hotter than windows ( or even than os x on my notebook : > ) i wonder , if there are any tricks ( that for example are n't turned on by default because they can be a bit unstable ) to make notebook a bit cooler .
matlab . actually i have n't installed it . i just extracted it and i want to run it via gnome-do .

hi everyone . thanks for looking at my problem . i have now discovered that the home folder in the computer folder has two high level folders . one is the new one created from the install of 15.04 ( the default home folder ) and one is the old one from the previous 14.04 version . so i have found the files . i 've still lost the address book from the previously version of thunderbird ( 14.04 ) so would appreciate any assistance with locating that . thanks from an inexperienced ubuntu user .
10.04 also , it tells me `` these updates are kept from being upgraded '' ( translated from french ) . and it lists the linux updates .
aka , i have a raw webm file that needs editing .
cd 's worked fine after install it all crashed . *fixed* now .
`ln -s /media/pix /home/tom/pictures` and all variations of this with and without trailing slashes give me either a link inside /pictures , or no link at all . ( possibly missing something simple here ? ) drive 2 ( sdb ) is /pix , and all my pictures are in folders at its root directory . i want to click on pictures from my home folder in nautilus , and be taken directly to the root directory of the second drive . this just is n't happening . i either get a new link inside /pictures , or i 'm taken to the empty /pictures folder ( on sda )

i am not sure . i currently browse the web about their specifications . they show 64 bits . i try some commands the output double : 32 bits , 64 bits . just like they can handle both.. ? i just want to know..
edit as i said i installed 64 bit version via pen drive ( outside windows ) with booting from pendrive and than intalling it . i have no idea what grub is , and there are so many partitions vaio made . i tried to change boot from uefi to lagacy , but it was saying some boot loader problem . i do n't wan na remove windows 7. so before things get wrong i switched back to uefi . what exactly i need to do to make ubuntu run ?
yes , i change them to a more transparent setting and nothing changes ? annoying .
indeed no helvetica or arial available . you think the update removed them ? ( i do n't remember if i had them before ) . if not , is it possible that ubuntu changed the default sans-serif font ?
i have updated the post .
yeah , i am in the us
there is ia but i do n't know why it does n't show up .
no . the machine is not called after the won has been sent . i 'm using 12.04
used an install cd , existing dual boot withwin7 , said i could replace older ubuntu and not wipe disk . did and no boot either . gparted says first partition is fat32 and id is efi and flagged boot . gparted recovery does n't work . several things i 'm asking , is that fat32 partition whats left of my windows and why is it so small ? is it recoverable ? windows repair disk wo n't work . at this point , i 'm not caring about the ubuntu on the machine . and lastly , should i just go ahead and recover my win7 with my disks . again , no uefi option in bios . here is the pastebin :
yes it has nvidia gtx960m .
what does hosts file mean ? in adhoc network , each of them are hosts , there is no infrastructure .
todo . i borrowed a usb adapter , copied and pasted , `` lsusb | grep network '' , but got no response whatsoever ( whether with or without sudo ) . is there comething else i can try ? odysseus
yes , irssi has an add-on script that does that .
i follow this tutorial where then it leads me to use wget . tried wget absolutepath/targetfile.php usr/bin/wget absolutepath/targetfile.php also tried using relativepath to targetfile.php by changing directory to absolutepath first .
i have tried the methods that were listed there . i have tried editing lightdm.conf and adding xserver-command=x -dpi 80 ( my default is 96 ) and there is no change . i have tried the second method of creating a file called 77set_dpi and adding xrandr -- dpi 80x80 and moving it to the directory it asked me to . restarted and no difference .
why does tar complaint that it
i did a straight in stall from cd ... and i did the software up date . the last thing i did in ubuntu was load the windows file share thing . if its the hdd thats damaged ... is there a way to check ? ? ? thx for the quick reply

i have a partition so i want to install on the second partition of an external start-up disc .

i only used `sudo` for the `chown` command . i copied the directory via gui .
16 gb ( i think that 's a bit more then enough )
ya i did . i have tried everything whatever i was able to find out for troubleshooting but in vain ! !
yes .
yes i have whole screen , and if i want to reach windows it takes a while
-eq instead of = worked thanks guys you all are awesome ! ! ! ! ! thanks again
yes i meant `chown` , pardon me for the error
update : i just noticed my home connection is wep whereas my university connection is wpa .
i am using ubuntu 14.04
yep , changing the size of the window does n't make it any bigger .
yes . all the other computers running windows can access it .
good thinking , but i can not because ssh is n't running on this system .
it still gives the runit error and the git-daemon , with the dpkg error too
john , i can move other files to the trash normally , just this one gives me trouble .
for example i want people on skype hear what i hear
i already installed ubuntu 12.04 .

i need to know if i should get a r9 290 or a gtx 970 for ubuntu ! : d
i installed gmtp from ubuntu software center and libmtp 1.1.0 from sourceforge
, no , it was sogo pinyin , this input method never worked in my ubuntu , i uninstalled it from ubuntu software center . now when it 's gone , it left my ubuntu not working with this login problem .
i still have no idea what can be wrong with it , why does it fail .
note : it 's not important for removing whitespace around matched pattern inside a pair of quotes , but it would be better if i do n't have those . and also my files contain nested quotes like `` foo `` bar '' zoo '' and the all of quotes appear in one line and they are not expanded to multi lines .
: i 'm using **wired broadband** single user connection . and about icon only a single time it was connected with no internet access . rest the time its **not connected** at all .
that depends i suppose . is there something in the functionality of my prompt that 's causing the issue ? i did n't have this problem before on my universities open suse server since ls had no colorize option there , so i assume it 's ls colorize that 's causing the problem .
symbols are missing
i cant connect via ethernet but i 'm going to go check that possible duplicate thing .

yes . no unity entry at all . so how should i get that ?
i have ext4 ./ partition and two ntfs and i wish to resize one of this ntfs partitions for /home partition and /media that 's the question is it ok to break/resize ntfs mounted partion ?
i followed the steps in this thread ( blacklisting the various broadcom drivers and enabling the correct kernel module .
yes , it is . i should restart several times to finally come up with a clean boot !
when i am a good enough python programmer to know about glob i would probably do the whole thing in python but thanks for the comment . interestingly i found it fairly difficult to find anything on file management in python but i am probably searching for the wrong thing

nope , i 'm still experiencing this . going everywhere with my rj45 cable and connector in my backpack . any ideas.. ?

well , that works . but for some applications only . that is , it affects players ( mpv ) immediately . but flash in chrome does not seem to react . no matter what i write there that player just keeps playing with the same delay . youtube video played in native video player is affected , but not flash one .

unwanted updates means the updates that are not necessary , such as updates for **music player , gedit , ** and other apps that ubuntu provides . while the **important** updates includes update for **kernel** and **security updates** .
no , i use unity
no command `deb` found .
: i 've added it to my post .
**edit** it turned out that the apparent version mismatch is due to the to the simultaneous presence of a second version of sqlite ( version 3.6.1 installed by mathematica ) . since this installation path is in the environment variable `ld_library_path` svn seems to prefer this version and hence the mismatch . i could define an alias for svn or mathematica which exports ld_library_path before running the respective application , but i would prefer a more elegant solution . so , what is the recommended way to maintain two sqlite installations at the same time ?
specs : acer 4755g , 2nd gen intel i7 , 8gb ram

edit : even using the 64bit version of intels 1.0.1 utility , i am told my distro is n't supported . it is hard to call 12.04 lts if 3rd party hardware manufacturers call it obsolete .

removing `/etc/x11/xorg.conf.failsafe` does n't make any difference , unfortunately .
if you do n't have an answer , why are you wasting our time with a post ? ?
no , i have n't been able to solve this yet . i happens every time i plug my phone in to charge , which is annoying ...
i did n't get anything over there . can you please simplify it a bit
i dont rly know any programming languages : (
: yes , i 've tried both through the gui and with `xrandr -- auto` . i should also add that connecting the external monitor after booting into ubuntu does _not_ reveal the display on the external . i 've been resorting to `sudo reboot` via tty1 in these instances . another option , if i 'm lucky ( no typos or popups e.g . updates ) is to blindly type my password , followed by ctrl + alt + t and `xrandr -- auto` , which outputs the display correctly to the laptop screen . obviously this is not ideal . i 've also tried fn + f7 ( x200 shortcut to switch output devices ) to no avail .

i do n't have xubuntu installed now so it 's hard to know for certain .
tried all possibilities in the mentioned link . none of them worked . i gave up and reinstalled the system .
the reasons do not matter . my real reason is for personal use . i would be greatful if you provided the command .
update : this only happens when i kwin .
i have checked , with imageusb and with h2testw.exe , it is not damaged
yes , i am using 14.04 .
yeah , i ended up opting for that option . : (
no it does n't wake up like that also
yes it has been tried , and failed , because this is a manual install of samba , that service is not automatically installed , so it needs to be built . but i have followed the last link and other things to create the service , and none of them work . i still really need an answer to this .
it is python 2.7.6

well kindly show me how to do that . thanks
i 'm sure this is by design for some reason , i 'm just looking for a way to circumvent it . that might turn into a feature suggestion bug for a later release , but i want something i can use today .
oh , sorry , i should have mentioned that i was connected by ethernet during this entire process . by did n't work i mean that the wireless menu did not change at all and i could n't connect to the internet . it never ended up looking like this when it should have :
it was not getting updated from past one month.but i am checking through /usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.log . it was just showing the status of the services and what status to be mailed .

no , i do n't think so . i just `` installed alongside '' vista , which led me to a slider to adjust space . actually , i do n't think so : luna ate a lot of my space on c ( where vista is ) .
libusb_open ( ) failed : libusb_error_access . as i understand , this can occur if i have the xpad module still running . however before this i type , `` sudo rmmod xpad '' , which responds `` rmmod : error : module xpad is not currently loaded '' . i had also blacklisted xpad earlier with `` echo `` blacklist xpad '' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf '' and restarted the computer .
for everybody that responded to my post , many thanks , i highly appreciate it .
hi pilot6 , my ubuntu version right now is 14.04. i also try to install the 15.10 version but i get the same problem .
not that i know of , jacob . i just want to ad some lines of code to a bash script that will set some settings and bookmarks when run once .
i did n't uninstalled lxpanel . i just do n't use it . i prefer to switch between applications with alt-tab or using virtual desktops . lxpanel just clutters my screen unnecessarily . do you think i should file a bug ? is the launcher part of openbox or is it part of lxde and should not expect it to be available ?
no same issue unfortunately .
: the one writen in my question above .
no it should be the same .
it says mv : invalid option -- '1' try 'mv -- help ' for more information .
sorry i do not answered you when i create my question because i was need to find just simple right way to compile ff . and btw my failure was approximately equal to @ bd-th answer ( look below )
i would have sent a private message to you but i ca n't find a way to do that - i ca n't remove your comment . again thanks for your input
thanks for your reply . my query are can i combine 2 network as one ? if not , then ... how do i load balance that 2 network
yes , it is . i 'm can access the trash by the nautilus . only the icon in the launcher does n't work .
yes as florian said i mean the file selection dialog .
update .. i have installed windows 8 64bit but when i try to install ubuntu 13.04 64bit using usb .. it dont detect windows 8 and just show me to erase disk to install ubuntu instead of this screen
no , i am a student using the network at my school . is it possible that the port 22 is blocked by my school ?
thanks . i now know squashfs is just a zip of installed files . i installed the app using apt-get .
no i can not - i 've tried installing updates using update-manager but it keeps telling me to check network / internet connection . although network manager say connection good .
, so = significant other ( in this case , the wife : - ) i 'm with ubuntu 11.10. i 'm trying to set up an nfs network . i did achieve an ftp server . and , no , i did n't put any link or directory in my shared file .
? i know this seems like more than one question , but i basically need this game to work , and so i just need know if i it is safe to install the packages mentioned or not
both installed and uninstalled , similar to the above command :
sound works properly , but the dolby surround is n't . the sound the speakers should make is way better ( as on windows with dolby driver )
definitely not the keyboard . i actually checked this by swapping the hard drive into a new laptop , and the problem persists
those two come back as 32-bit , so i assume that i am actually running a 32-bit machine . i guess uname does n't give as accurate results as i had hoped . thanks
organic marble sorry for being off topic , but it was a a very general question about installing and re-installing and not about deepin . with that being said could you recommend a good deepin forum for a beginner ? ? ?
my unity-desktop is gone.suddenly i type those command in terminal : sudo apt-get purge unity gnome-shell lightdm sudo apt-get clean sudo apt-get autoremove .then i type sudo apt-get install unity-desktop.e : unable to locate package unity-desktop

i was able to install nethogs , and did n't notice anything that would be consuming the bandwidth , then the wifi stopped connecting for a long period of time . it constantly tried without any success . i shut the system down for a while , and when i restarted , the wifi was able to connect again , but still very slow .

how i coud n't think about this joke ?
it 's just one line of output : /opt/eclipse-luna/notice.html : xml document text

all the lines in the files are like the example
, i did say without `xdotool`
edit : i do n't think i let clear that i am trying to install ubuntu on my second computer , whose hdd are clean . my main computer , which i was referring to , has only windows 10 .
i did not have vlc installed . that seems to have solved it , thanks !
the error message is : > ( cheese:2332 ) : gtk-warning ** : attempting to add a widget with type gtkimage to a gtkbutton , but as a gtkbin subclass a gtkbutton can only contain one widget at a time ; it already contains a widget of type gtklabel
yeah , i realized we can change the default setting , but it makes it slightly more annoying to use and can be misinterpreted as 'lag ' . a better default setting would be like 0.1 , or something . that small of a difference matters in terms of usability .

accepted the automatic upgrade notification
it is still valid for any of the versions that followed it .
no just at home
sorry for not being clear , i meant the user paths under the user tab in system settings where you can define your own paths for use folders .
excuse me but can you guys tell me how to write a code or this gray part in the text to write what i have in terminal
yes i need the nvidia drivers for hdmi audio output , i have tried both , version current and version current-updates .
- the id is just a dummy column that i want to get rid of it !
thanks @ muru , at last i tried with gnupot , nevertheless i would have preferred to use something simpler
actually , software updater popped up and i did it . i now notice , it was before updating too . and to mention it no third party softwares where installed too even i checked it ... so no music and videos which i could install later on but not without apt-get working . this is my sources.list nothing inside sources.list.d
i am looking for an absolute solution or a permanent workaround , since doing one of the temporary workarounds i mentioned each time is annoying .
i want to do that for the sake of power consumption . but in a way that whenever i need wifi and bluetooth , i could remove them from block list .
edit : the problems seems to be related to recent changes in ubuntu way of mounting network shares : the old directory : /home//.gvfs is now replaced by : /run/user/1000/gvfs and the name of shares mounted are not readable from wine ( so it say trying to open the folder directly from ms word )
it says `` lightdm : unrecognised service

it happened since i have been messing with my graphics drivers , xorg and xubuntu-desktop
yes . but still get that error
i have 8gb of ram with 64-bit processor . yesterday remove dust sink and fans and for now does not crash . now it works ok. thanks for everything .
: in case my laptop is stolen or lost , i want nobody to be able to get my data .
i did it with windows partition
i have used the link to paste.ubuntu.com that you provided .
, the files came from a former installation of ubuntu ( i think it was 9.04 ) on the same machine .
it take no effect .
oh yes , i have written many thousands of lines of python code . but so far using only the standard libraries , thus the need to get python-dev working .
yes , the display works , i can watch something on it with the sound coming from the laptop boxes . i should add that it is a mini-dp output , i have a minidp to hdmi plug .
, that was just an example , the folder is being created where i want it to , its just that the folders are not being created with the right permission .
i 'm sure it is . when i booted from the usb i had installed my windows 7 iso to , i made sure to select the `uefi : **usb name**` in the boot options as i did do my research and the uefi option does boot to uefi mode . and it seems to be the only way to install windows 7 to my hard drive .
on a side-note , is there any other way to download things other than apt-get and the software center ? edit : added output . lakshya @ inspiron3521 : ~ $ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/ { giggle , android-studio } * . { post , pre } inst cat : /var/lib/dpkg/info/giggle*.postinst : no such file or directory cat : /var/lib/dpkg/info/giggle*.preinst : no such file or directory cat : /var/lib/dpkg/info/android-studio*.postinst : no such file or directory cat : /var/lib/dpkg/info/android-studio*.preinst : no such file or directory edit 2 : i 'm getting this red sign on my menu bar now . !

luchonacho- i am having slow connection . for example i was sitting about a meter away from the router and i was getting a slow connection and timing out while loading pages
i did imported certain ssl certs into jvm 's keystore when i setup the java at first . later i found out , after the update it also updates the jvm keystore and the certificates i imported where not there.. that 's the one reason .
which way do you mean , i have tried to remove it and then trying to reinstall it again but it 's all generating the same above error
i 'm not sure how to find something like that out ? also , what card are you talking about ? i also actually uninstalled 15.04 because i heard that 14.04 is more stable and does n't have the wireless problems ; but i 'm actually having the exact same problem with 14.04
sure thanks . it led to another problem i have a line of r code that throws an error when run from php but doesnt throw any error when run from the commandline . i 'll have to post that as another question .
yes . that 's very simple but how to make it open a site and provide login details and make login automatically .
yes i 'm using my laptop .
the log file 's size is 17 gb ! i have no other file in my computer more than 3 gb .
i 'm someone who installed ubuntu 11.10 on his computer and erased w7 . now i want to erase it and i do n't know how ... someone who could explain me in simple terms , step by step ! ! ! thanks . i also searched elsewhere but explanations are not good , they skip steps or are too risky -- -
yes i do , its a hp wireless keyboard and mouse
i closed all the windows before updating , but it wo n't response
it shows up in the left sidebar of file manager but it 's not mounted there it 's just listed . i tried to mount the drive using `gparted` as well , but the `mount` option is not active for this partition . there 's a warning as well which says : _unable to read the contents of this file system ! because of this some operations may be unavailable._
the result must be 3 but i got nothing ! ! ! !
yes , i just installed r and rstudio about 2 days ago . so will this affect r ?
, i expect that when i do `echo hello > iii` , the output of the cat will be saved somewhere and then , when i do `tail ooo` or something else , this output will be printed , `tail` will close and the `cat` will remain open for another echo .

nope intel wi fi card . cheers anyways .
now with the edit of .bashrc i am getting `` bash : alias : xmaple : not found bash : alias : = : not found bash : alias : /home/sohail/maple13/bin/xmaple : not found ''
i have n't learned how can i change which reader opens pdf 's . for example .
eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz
thanks it worked !
thanks @ davidfoerster , i 've added the /proc/mounts output - this is the encrypted home setup that you can enabled out-of-the-box on ubuntu .
- preferably i would like to keep the ability of selecting only part of the screen ( as in shift+prtscr ) , and choosing the name of the file . - in case that matters , i always save my screenshots in ` $ home/pictures` .
thanks guys i got it installed the in uefi mode .
i was upgrading from ubuntu 14.04 lts . the only reason i have decided for it was because i bought a new external monitor ( i have a laptop ) and there was some glitch that was supposed to be corrected in next version .
thanks . i looked for sftp config files as i thought it was included , but i did n't see anything . is there a way to configure it ? are they in the regular ssh etc folder somewhere ?
no , i always used a 64-bit version .
gk107glm ( quadro k1100m ) . i tried nvidia-361 , nvidia-358 and nvidia-355 .
as requested i did some more tries and diagnostics . both `gnome-terminal.real` and `gnome-terminal.wrapper` returned the same error message , and `locale` gives : lang=en_us language=en_us : lc_ctype= '' en_us '' lc_numeric= '' en_us '' lc_time= '' en_us '' lc_collate= '' en_us '' lc_monetary= '' en_us '' lc_messages= '' en_us '' lc_paper= '' en_us '' lc_name= '' en_us '' lc_address= '' en_us '' lc_telephone= '' en_us '' lc_measurement= '' en_us '' lc_identification= '' en_us '' lc_all= i normally do n't bother modifying the locale , and have n't done so this time either , just selected us langage when installed ( i think ) .
yes i can confirm it 's installed .
: html5 video seems to work alright . as does sound in other software like banshee . but not all content on the web is available in html5 , so i think i still need to work out what it is that makes flash fail .
if i disable docky when it has happened , there 's no effect - the icon attached to the mouse will still be there . if i disable it for good , there 's no similar icon ( or image ) i can accidentally or on purpose , that i can drag around , which does have the same effect . so yes , the problem will go away without docky , but that does n't `` clear '' the mouse .
i updated my post with new screenshot . i would like to mention is i have ubuntu 16.04 with dual boot partition with windows 10 .
i tried making a live usb but as i do n't have access to the bios i 'm not able to boot it . the brand apppears but it does n't matter when i press f2/f12 , nothing happens . it used to work but not now .
**edit : ** i tried to follow @ mohit 's answer . this is what happened : janreggie @ janreggie-t100ta : ~ $ sudo apt-get install wine-bin reading package lists ... done building dependency tree reading state information ... done e : unable to locate package wine-bin additionally , i tried to install other versions of wine ( in this case , `wine1.6` ) , and it still does n't work . if else fails , i 'll just run a windows virtual machine . **edit 2** i performed a clean installation of lubuntu in my pc , and that pesky `exec format error` does n't appear anymore . `wine` now works . my system was the problem .
which package do you think i should reinstall ?
yeah . for what it 's worth removing the old maven 2 fixes the issue but somewhere out there a file is adding it to the path . the files i listed above do not contain this addition .
nope , i had to fix it by completely removing the ubuntu and reinstalling it , i hope that if it happens again my key will work : /
[ problem solved ] the problem was about nvidia , i installed nvidia , then it worked .
yes i do have that installed ! how do i remove it ?
no , i can not tell you how . that is exactly what i try to find out . i just read on [ link ] ( that it should be possible to do it : features : ... .. hexadecimal input and output ... ..
thanks , but no i do n't . i got a new machine shortly after this .
i do not know what it is . i removed it with sudo apt-get remove postfix and now autoremove returned no errors . thank you . anything else interesting you have to say , do say ! thank you very much
yes i 'm totally sure .
it 's for my wireless , i want connect my wireless
the most stable version is 1.8.4 and 1.9.17 is development version ... . i want solution for the stable version ... have you tried multi user on 1.9.x ?
yes , openssh server is already installed .
only sometimes , but i ca n't figure out what , exactly , causes this to happen . now that i look at ccsm , it appears that the option to enable unity is now completely missing . the button to get to the unity plugin settings is there , but there is no checkbox to enable it .
, i just updated the op to include the version
yes , i restarted ... several times
i do n't think there is a gui is for this in the current version of ubuntu ( 15.10 as of writing ) . i think there was in some of the previous versions ? i would love to see a list of all of the different options that can setxkbmap can take . the xbk documentation that i looked at has a couple of common examples but seems to merely scratch the surface . i 've seen a couple of posts with more examples that are geared towards emacs users . i 'd love to be able to make the windows key function as a shift key as well . if anyone knows the option for that please post !
: `ifconfig -a` gives **eth1 link encap : ethernet hwaddr 08:00:27 : ee:25:3d** and **lo link encap : local loopback** just included the first line from the display . this is from guest os .

it 's completely unresponsive . it did n't panic , it just ran out of memory . the last update to a top display showed 0 bytes of swap and a couple of kb of physical memory .
yes , but they are broken with the same error . i may have found a work-around , i 'm going add it as an answer now .
thank you for confirming gilles ' answer wo n't work . would you have a solution ?
the output is : `` xclip is /usr/bin/xclip '' . as i mentioned , pasting through xclip works just fine for whatever reason .
ah yes , i forgot to mention in my question that i have indeed enabled that sysctl parameter : `~ # sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1`
stosberg , thank you for your insightful comments . i will answer your 2 questions in detail in 10 minutes . we need to get this working by 8:00 a.m tomorrow .
like i described above , when my computer falls asleep and i wake it up for some reason all the fb0 art that i drew gets overriden by the framebuffer terminal . and incase you suggest i disable the framebuffer terminal , i have already tried that and my fb0 art still went away , i want to know when my laptop falls asleep so i can re-draw the image when it wakes up .

i 've written a mail to bug-bash @ gnu.org and got the following answer from chet.ramey @ case.edu , presumably the maintainer of the bash shell : `` thanks for the report . this is an artifact of how the arrays/hash tables are initialized by `declare ' , as you suspect . the variable should remain undefined until explicitly assigned a value . i will take a look and see what effect that will have on other parts of the code . ''
: thank you for the suggestion , i will use it as a last option if i ca n't do it with wget .
all solutions to this that i 've encountered were *not* idempotent on arch linux . that is , running `xmodmap ~/.xmodmap` repeatedly results in errors . i 'm sure it 's *possible* to be idempotent with `xmodmap` , it just does n't seem at all obvious how to achieve this .
if i can

not sure if i answer it right . the data is a common log file and the content within happens to occur between tags .
i may have misunderstood the instructions , but i think i set up the vpn manually rather then using the network-manager gui interface with pptp module . i do not want to use the gui interface because i do not have one installed on the remote machine . i found instruction/documentation for pptp-linux and not for network-manager-pptp or at least i found pptp-linux first and it worked on the first try other then it did not auto route all traffic through the vpn . if you think networkmanager is worth another look i will dig deeper into it though .
`darwin kernel version 14.3.0`
yes . need logic how to do this simply .
i have sony dvds which are n't getting burned by a burner . i tried burning my ubuntu 13.10 o.s . on it . the thread for this issue of burning is [ here ] ( as the sony dvds are n't getting burned , i want to use it to copy photoes and videos . so , i 'm using `dd` command .
i have updated the post - was it what you were looking for ?
the linux machine is an asus netbook , stabledog .
thanks . it seems like you are right and this is a nfs .
no , the word `oom` is not present in syslog or dmesg . total ram is about 2gb here , are those oom killings likely to happen just after a fresh boot ?
... if purpose is unknown the question is not worth answearing ... ? i want special system environment .
i do not have a file called error_log in that directory . i do have a file called error_log.1 in that directory . the contents are a few pages long . i did n't think it would be a good idea to paste the whole thing here , so i have pasted it on pastebin . here it is [ link ] (
i 'm sorr for forgetting to close the question ! i ended up using the dnsmasq in the dd-wrt router , eg . address=/thedomain.com/172.16.0.2
the files has different number of lines . i thought awk is quite good in manipulating datasets . that is the reason i have chosen awk .
the installation packages are only available for 14.04. so i ca n't not solve the actual problem .
yes . there is suppose to be a cron job that runs to rotate the log file and keep its size down . once i fixed that cronjob the problem went away . i also found that the procmail on the solaris systems was built with diffent file locking options . on solaris procmail -v shows `locking strategies : dotlocking , fcntl ( ) , lockf ( ) ` and on linux procmail -v shows `locking strategies : dotlocking , fcntl ( ) ` . not sure what that means . if anyone knows please comment .
added f4 one , since they ca n't be in a single screen and i know f4 ones are what not seen on f3 while being seen on f5 .
i do n't have any `\ [ ..\ ] ` in the prompt . and $ term is linux ( i updated the details list with these two ) .
default . i think this python was installed as part of the ubuntu installation . umask is giving me 0002. i have not changed it .
how can i fix this error an continue with installing ? why is there a error ?
thanks stephane , it is indeed caused by name service cache .
i 'm trying to find the reasons why one would choose , say debian over arch or vice versa , provided you can get access to any version of any package .
thanks all for your ideas , i edited the question to add more information .
when i do `echo $ prompt_command` , it shows `update_terminal_cwd ; ` on mavericks

that was the answer ! the owners never had ownership of `*/writespace` . i am now able to write to those directories with each respected user . are you able to turn this into an answer so i can mark it as such ?
yes , the os is scientific linux
it was meant to say that a string which you enter , it looks for it in the file and it says if that string is present . i 've now realised that i need to enter another bit of code for else . thanks
different people have a different ethic .
disconnect/reconnect of keyboard no help . i do not run other other oss ( at least not on systems with a ps/2 interface ) . as noted , logout is sufficient to restore operation . i can try other fault-isolation techniques but i was interested to hear if any others have similar experiences .

i 'm at home now , will check tomorrow -- - just a quick question , is the problem likely to do with port forwarding ? i.e . i just need to configure router2 to pass a given address : port from router1 and host it from router1 using some chosen port ?
the problem is that i believe usb generates interrupts that may slow down critical code . for example
if the above pattern ( number|my_name|number ) is not macthed in my file , i have to print a message exit the loop .
it 's bash . i tried also bash .

i 'd still need the python-devel , right ? is n't that a system package , not a python environment package ?
i have 1.8 , 1.9 and 2.1. which one do you want me to use ?
ah thanks for pointing out which is the kernel parameter . i will try to add 'single ' to the end of it and follow instructions from there .

it was tricky for me to get my script changed ( ran into some unrelated issues ) , but your suggestion worked ole . thank you for your help , and for parallel itself - i 'm finding it quite useful . still strikes me as odd sem does n't work for me , but i 'm happy for now with this solution .
i mean area where you can upload file by dropping file from desktop
yes . i just tested it with user `root` by using `su -` , then `eog` .
they do n't really have a structure , but there are key words in each and every file proceeding the information i need . that is `` server '' , `` destip '' and `` srcip '' . i just need to pull that information out all of the files and put it into some kind of spreadsheet where i can relate the server to those ips . sorry that 's all i have , not giving you much to go really i know
i am not concerned about `vi` . i know of other methods to view the contents if the filesize is huge . i was doing various tests to learn how linux manages memory and had this question .
i realized there are two different xorg input drivers , one called *evdev* , the other called *libinput* . i 'm using *evdev* on gentoo and i do n't have any other input drivers compiled . i do n't know how to properly check the list of kernel devices and how *evdev* and *libinput* treat them . related links : * * # 18756948

yup , that works .
thanks @ leiaz , your answer was very helpful ! if you write your comment as an answer , i 'll accept it so that you get rep for it : )
it will work but what should be inside the awk_file.awk file , or how to format the inputs of both the files or you can say how i will control the inputs of both the files ... ? ?
edit : the point of this is that in some cases i want my replacement scripts to have an higher priority over the regular system commands , while in some other cases i want the opposite . so i 've set `` $ home/bin '' as first in the path , so now i can define priorities for each command individually .
groups shows i 'm in rsnap , even after relogging .
others can shutdown the machine or log in while i have it locked .
unfortunately the only computer i have at the moment is my laptop with win7 , so i can not check that
no , it is not . i can successfully start it from the command line , just not as an upstart job .
updated my question with an answer to yours , @ jennyd
i was using geedit to create the file . im not sure what encoding im using on both machines , how do i check them ?
-- -- -- -- -- # # note # # the reason i am using `-c /bin/bash` is that it actually looks more like `-c /bin/bash -- rcfile /path/to/rcfile` ... and therefore is different from a mere `sudo -i` or `sudo su -` and so on ... the reason i gave the command line as i did above in my question was that it is the minimal example that reproduces the problem .
logging on same machine too shows same scenario . @ warl0ck thanks for that .
about 5 files and yes . if i do it via grep i can find the file but i dont want to do it via grep
colors are working , less is not tailing , it just reads what the file looks like when it 's first opened .
ok , bear with me , will do this too : d thanks for your help man : )
what is raid ? in short no .
i 'm hoping to be able to monitor users in realtime like top .
yes . i did n't changed anything . i do exactly the same like i did in the first time .
the processor is intel atom . suppose that means no arm architecture .
if i remove the code in else path when the process is restarted it wont throw alert that `` the process is running `` .. ! thats the challenge im facing here . 1.process stop -- > email alert should be triggered 2.when process is started again -- > email alert should be triggered only once .rest of the time when process is running it should not throw email alert .
how would that look like ? afaiu i 'd loose the ability of less to display streamed data as soon as it gets it , would n't i ? i would have to wait for the preprocessor to finish converting the file ?
it 's for ubuntu and related systems , if working , e. g. xubuntu .
update question with real rules . thanks will b. for the $ ( ) clarification
the only two lines with xfercommand in /etc/pacman.conf are commented out : # xfercommand = /usr/bin/curl -c - -f % u > % o # xfercommand = /usr/bin/wget -- passive-ftp -c -o % o % u
i was thinking to add that info , question updated ! do you have any suggestion ( s ) ? : )
i want to alter the structure . i 'm sorry if that was unclear .
thanks , how can i tell how much of the space is reserved ?
thank @ halosghost , i added the make log .
so i guess there is no mount option that helps me out here or any special trick . this is the same as any other filesystem running out of inodes i guess .
the output of `ip route` : # ip route default via 192.168.0.1 dev enp0s3 proto static metric 100 192.168.0.0/24 dev enp0s3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.100 metric 100
yes - email addresses
for `` cat /sys/block/sdc/sdc1/start '' output is *1* . and for vgcfgrestore -- list vg output is *no archives found in /etc/lvm/archive*
i am trying to read the vmstat output in a meaningful way . right now i can see blocks in and blocks out , but that does not tell me how much that is in terms of size . i would like to know if 512 b = 1 block or 1kb = 1 block , or something else .
is it bad idea - use variables as parametrs for functions ?
there shouldnt be any order if i remember correctly . i 'm not 100 % sure , i just know that the output has to look like that . still an amateur at this so everything is sort of new .
two `while read` loops , one for each list of
from the help it appears s is required : update-rc.d [ -n ] defaults [ nn | ss kk ]
i 've checked , it 's not even active to change . it 's dimmed , but it 's set on `disabled`
no i do n't want it to be able to read files either .
updated with more info
yes , it 's not there .
i dont think this has anything to do with the xml . its just a dummy xml i created for testing .
access ( optimally as a directory/virtual disk ) from all desktop platforms ( mobile platforms would be nice ) . i do n't really need any features around user management , just password protection is fine .
the question was basically : how can i resolve this issue without lowering the timeout ? because that does n't work on my version of bash .
no i am trying to attack a hash with john the ripper and i need to combine different files accordingly
- it is used beyond mysql . it is used by the os apparently . i need to know why .
yeah i guess the point is to not allow users to login anymore . but it seems like on my system , via ssh , they still can login .
i just edited the description . is it clear ?

yes , i have `` perl `` , seems like it might be standard to have on aix . after tinkering around , i was able to get it with this one-liner `` /usr/bin/perl -e `` print ( ( getpwuid ( ( stat ( 'foo ' ) ) [ 4 ] ) ) [ 0 ] ) ; '' `` . it works , just not as pretty to write as linux `` stat `` . i guess i 'm really just playing code ( script ) golf .
apologies for the late reply ! i could find no errors on the `pre-up` line , but running `iptables-restore` manually did work as expected .
speight - yes , i do have working /sys . but however i massage `realpath` , it does not show the ip address of the iiscsi host .
they do n't have to be parsable as unix timestamps . i figured my lame implementation would n't be too bad , but darn it was slow .
i need to save the changes in the original files
would be for nearly created users @ peterph
: i replaced `*` with `+` to avoid the comment formating , it should be `etc/*-release` , it seems to work .
edit : the other question ( supposed to be duplicate ) does n't really help . anyway the **solution** is to install sun studio 11 - the last version that supports solaris 8 and solaris 9. oracle patch 12685437 fwiw .
a cropped linux systems for tv have not sed command . so i has to use other command or script to instead of sed 's/a/b/g ' .
if it is blocking on io , then it should ideally go to uninterruptable d state , which is not happening .

thanks jsbillings . now i have new question . i ask it in below of my first question .
the rest of the standard library , especialy stdio.h .
oh ! you are right . problem solved !
yes . i copy text out of the terminal using the shortcut key ( which i guess is the quickest way ) , not by directing the output to a file
i really do . i 've specified this version in `` `` debian/control `` ``
this script capture data from $ data when $ data -text file exists and then passes parameters to program.sh . sometimes it works fine but all the suddenly in the next turn of loop it turns out like there is no data passed to program.sh like it was removed before it was readed that $ data . keep in mind that $ data is continuously created by another program .
: why sleep ? plus , this would not detect that data are not getting through .
hi alan , thanks for the suggestion . yes , the input files should be sorted , but to make double sure i have updated the test script to include a sort before doing the join .
the output is empty with the bash script !
. there is not such file : (
this *is* the small filesystem for write
and the same with removing multiple files of the same extension : rm /home/tarakaramji/*.txt
i did n't know about printf , with printf it works : p ... so what does it make not working with echo then ?
i just thought that `ack` is always better than `grep` . i was wrong : ) .
it does not matter as long as it allows me to access the programs on the remote desktop and easy to use
how else would i install it then ?
i run ps xl -uand i get 9 processes , of which one is called twm
. can you have a look at this
yes i have networkmaneger running
found the issue : i must mount `/dev/sda1` as `/boot` **before** running `update-initramfs` .

i was able to access osx by installing refind on fedora . i did a new install , same problems . i 'll go with the refind solution mentioned , even if it is not very clean . still , i 'd like to know if there is any clean solution for the problem .
thanks for the edit , the link was helpful too .
i am uploading the files via `total commander` tool . as per my information , there is some file in unix that handles ftp umask.i am not able to find out what that file is .

edit : i have made a page with examples of all solutions so far here :
, thanks for your prompt reply . i exactly did that and the again grepped the queue id in the mail log but in between 16:00 to 16:15 83 mails has been sent so i was wondering is there any way to search option can be more precise . since the mail had 3 recipients so was it possible to narrow down the search somehow ?
i ca n't find a tutorial on how to set up a shared hosting server . the part that i 'm missing is the way privileges are set for the webmasters so that they do n't see each others directories . ______________ # # previous post : _how ovh can configure their ssh server to do this ? _
i need all files which starts with /home/bzz/.cache
well i 'll be damned ! i did n't know that i ca n't connect to my public ip from inside the lan.. can you briefly explain why this does n't work ? in other news , i tried to connect from another pc ( other ip ) to ssh and it worked , so problem solved !

yes and no . i have a command-line program that i want to run permanently on my raspberry , which writes a lot to stdout.let 's say , i 'm connecting over ssh with my macbook , run the program , then disconnect . then i connect again , how can i get the output of my program ? that 's not possible i think .
these numbers to each row , so that i can later sort my rows according to it . how can i add this information at
it is from the timestamp that the file has in the system : 'dec 1 - > 2014 12 01 ' and then t followed by the time 17:18 .
no , it does not exist .
i set `` users allowed to start the x server '' to `` console users only '' . afterwards i tweaked `/etc/init/tty1.conf` so that the default user would be logged in automatically , and i changed `~/.profile` , so that `startxfce4` is issued on a console login - > xfce now starts automatically on bootup . i do n't think this is relevant , to be honest - sorry for the red herring .
from : /home/893591/si/data/mpsftp/krnu003/forftp to : /home/893591/si/data/mpsftp/krnu003 i 'm just actually testing my ftp code within the same server , given that the remote server is not yet accessible . so what i am trying to do here is that transferring the file to another folder within the server .
that solved it . write an answer so i can accept it .
this is an ubuntu 15.10 , so this is probably upstart ?
yes , in emacs . though not as often as it does in xterm .
those files were different , i made them identical ( on the second system i added a line like `search winshared.de` ) . but still the name could not be resolved .
i should clarify that i 'm not a coder or programmer . i just want to have previous versions of text files that i edit . these text files maybe `.css` or `.rc` or `.svg` files that form part of a theme . so if i edit some aspect of a theme 's file , i can go back a bit in case i do n't like a change i made .
yes , i can ssh to his ip .
correct . i was able to using root ( using both my linux pw and the pw configured in ldap ) , so i feel pretty convinced that it authenticated via ldap yesterday . not sure if this is n't what 's recommended or not though . should i create another account instead ?

no i edit my question
it 's a vps from vultr so i am very limited in the diagnostics i can perform on the actual hardware ( i should mention this in my question , i will update ) . they tell me that it 's just memory and nothing the host is doing could be causing it . i really do n't know .
no , gpt does n't work either .
i edited the original question with some output .
no , neither works .
it is zsh . why ?
it could help if you allow only one file e.g . allowing ` [ editor ] /etc/pacman.conf` instead of just ` [ editor ] ` .

how do you mean ? do you mean that it does not seem to be the desired output ? cause it looks like it does but i may have missed something
how can i fix the following error ?
, yes , it is .
sorry , i did n't . if you do figure it out , please post it as an answer here : )

update question
no . actualy i am trying to fetch data from a xls file and trying to do some manupulation on that .
that 's it i guess . wan na make that an answer ?
, i believe i stated what i want to do . say i want to copy reliably and fast all of the `/proc/*/cmdline` and all of the `/proc/*/statm` and `/proc/*/status` files . can you suggest a tool/script that can do that for me ?
the same warning occurs either way , but just `lsof` outputs a large list of the open files . i think it is a side issue . i thought that maybe the file was held open by a process and that might have been the reason why root was unable to move the file , but that does n't appear to be the case . hence the confusion .
i had tagged fedora 18 but it was removed for some reason .
please check my edit 1 ) above
i use system monitor to see ram usage .
thanks for the tips , truth is i just started unix this week , so your thoughts are very helpful , will keep that in mind
no i have n't set it up yet , about 415 gb unallocated space left . my main issue is i want to keep all data as ntfs , and only os specific data as their respective filesystems . how do i set up the home root boot var partitions in respect of space in gb ? any hints helpful .
thank you . i did download the wrong one for linux mint .
- my bad ; no , the path does not include spaces . i shortened it to make it easier to read and avoid horizontal scrolling . i 'll update the question .

my awk script processes a file and writes everything to an output file . in the end , i wish to ask the user if he wants to see the output file . if he wishes to , i `cat` the file .
can you give me some example ?
actually no , ill be using it inside a script . i wanted to follow a log that is expanding then i want to stop the tail command if it see a specific string .
that is almost certainly the issue . let me go an investigate and get back to you .
the numbers in question will be the first occurrence of a string of numeric characters 9 or more digits long . ideally it could be matched using that criteria , or the criteria of the first number occurring after the `` photo for ( `` text .

well , the first comments are rolling in . ignacio vazquez-abrams who knows what he 's talking about strongly recommended that i install mock from the epel repository . he says centos and epel maintainers have a deal to not step on each other 's toes . yum install fedora-packager # install mock groupadd mock abcd # add abcd to the mock group cd ~ ; mock -- rebuild openssl-1.0.0-27.el6.src.rpm ok , i think i get it . mock is some supersmart rpm-build that give a lot of diagnostics and fixes things that are wrong . it 's slow though . ca n't wait to see the output .
never heard of it will need to do some research thanks .

yes . this is exactly the solution i 'm looking for . thanks !
thanks @ faheemmitha . unfortunately , the only config file i can find ( `/etc/cups/printers.conf` ) spits out the same information as `lpoptions` , i.e . no driver location . nothing else in /etc/cups seems to have it either .
deepin uses go as a backend , building their ui as html5 applications . as such , they have some weird stuff going on there . my last experience ( with their previous release ) tells me ccsm might screw things up a lot . i prefer a more direct approach ( i.e doing things manually ) , if you can help with that : - )
i have added the screenshot of the pids
thanks for responding . it 's a root server . i know that one creates limits , as you mentioned ... that 's why i 'm asking the question ... it 's a problem !
i 'm using latex ... maybe this question is more appropriate on the tex stackexchange ?

yes @ sreeraj , i am able to use `vi`
, i would like ( 1 ) `` single package '' , because ( 2 ) `` whole repo '' will take time to download and consume too much space .
another complicating factor is that i 'm at college , so i 'm running this on my cs department 's virtual machine . in other words , i can not sudo . and there is a lot of noise i must sort through . but whenever i use ps -ef | grep [ my username ] , i only see some basic commands that are automatically running and none pertaining to the scripts i was running
i mean deletion sorry .
i agree with you : it is an uncommon situation . yes , the lines are unique and the same line is not added in the two files in different places .
did n't start `wpa_supplicant` myself . maybe kali does it ?
looking at the boot log for the device , i can see `` acpi : acpi bus type pnp unregistered '' . this is preceded by `` pnp : pnp acpi : found 14 devices '' . i can also see references to an acpi `` power '' and `` sleep '' buttons .
uhh , in bash : )
: yeah , i did this now and it solves my problem . though it is of course not the best solution : p
no , it has n't been solved . i even tried to download the packages individually and had problems . if i recall correctly , dnf could not find some of the 32 bit binaries . the next step was to build those from source , but i never made it that far . i think i am going to wait for fedora 23 and see if things improve .
exactly . `my_name` owns all files after they 've been rsynced to uni . @ tink that did not made any difference .

ha ha ha ... i completely forgot that autossh is just a wrapper for ssh . i checked it 's help dialog for debuging option and forgot to check ssh itself . thank you !
, thanks for the reply . i am new to this site and hence the formatting is not correct . the output will have only one faults/suspect/checks . in fact i have to find if there is any value ( greater than 0 ) before any of these three words . i used grep -op in bash / linux and it worked , but the same is not working on my aix server .
not yet ... have n't tried implementing maxmackie 's suggestion though , you could give that a shot .
full arguments look like , `/usr/bin/bash /proj/cmp01/app/ftf/bin/ftf.sh -y -c /proj/cmp01/app/btws/cfg/btws_fnhkdr.cfg /usr/bin/bash /proj/cmp01/app/ftf/bin/ftf.sh -y -c /proj/cmp01/app/btws/cfg/btws_bilvim_e2e.cfg /usr/bin/bash /proj/cmp01/app/ftf/bin/ftf.sh -y -c /proj/cmp01/app/btws/cfg/btws_giwsch_e2e.cfg /usr/bin/bash /proj/cmp01/app/ftf/bin/ftf.sh -y -c /proj/cmp01/app/btws/cfg/btws_bilspi_e2e.cfg /usr/bin/bash /proj/cmp01/app/ftf/bin/ftf.sh -y -c /proj/cmp01/app/btws/cfg/btws_cpbtdr.cfg`
i 'm using the `amd64` port of debian 7.8 .
because i want to open and manipulate that image in my app .
because of what i 've said in the post , + that 's a lot of keystrokes to type . creating an alias for this will need to have different name than `pacman` to avoid name conflicts , and now your package manager has two entry points : `pacman` and `your_alias` . and having multiple entry points for package managers reminds me of debian 's `aptitude` , `apt-get` , `apt-cache` and `dpkg` madness .
keyboard keymap encrypt
: i see , there seemed to be something missing at the end of my question . i hope now it is clearer
`` bad session name ''
thanks for the tip !
nope , there is no such file or directory , does this mean that i have to reinstall mysql via yum ?
: i expanded the code . thanks .
this is qubes-os , a linux-xen environment directed to security , so most common options are disabled for security reasons . the above reported command is the only one that works .
i use itunes primarily to sync music to my ipod , but other than that i use it to play music as opposed to streaming like pandora or spotify .
hydranix yes i 'm root . rbanffy all this system is on debian server . we actually allow users to do sudo -u website cp . so they never run command as root .
i 've did it myself from following sources
sorry i should have also mentioned , the interfaces previously did n't have a network script , so i created mostly blank ones for each that state only the interface and onboot=no
i just need to keep the highest .
the script should exit with 1 .
i believe my script , when run on the server , is being called like this : `sh myscript` so even though my script starts with ` # ! /bin/bash` and `echo $ shell` returns /bin/bash , source is somehow still not working .
i use `locate` ( gnu findutils ) 4.4.2. its `updatedb` is indeed a shell script ( /usr/bin/updatedb.findutils ) . i 'll see what i can do from there . thanks .
i do n't know really the difference for a bb .
i would like to have super , but i first tried crtl , because this was mentioned in the question i put the link .
yes , there do exist some other ways to ask this question . thanks for pointing it out . i did n't realize it at first . : )
i 'm on mint ; there 's no separate mount for `/proc` , so it 's included in `/dev/mapper/mint -- vg-root / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1`
i updated the question , what does it mean that they come from the same source ? - because they do !
correction : crunchbang does not . stable=500 . not sure how or why stable got repinned to 995 , but it 's not default .
yes , lost in copy-paste , thanks : )
its an hcl it was bought in 2008 .
img1.pnm , img2.pnm , etc .
i am using the tcsh shell .
i want to test this command
sorry i guess i was ambiguous there . for example , in the `ls` output above `fc` stands for `` fibre channel '' but there 's also `scsi` and `iscsi` etc ( not such but i think infiniband has a designation ) . basically , it 's the designation that shows you by what means the volume is being presented to the system , i 'm looking for a way to differentiate local , fibre channel , mutlipath , and iscsi devices .
running in qemu-based virtual machine ,
that 's exactly the point @ lambert i 'm sure the script is exiting because of `set -e` , but , i was surprised by which step was causing the return code to be different than `0` .
does n't work now on new distros
i am quiet confident that it is enp0s3 for eth0 . i am not sure why funny names in centos 7. i think eth0 for my centos 6.8 virtual machine
any part in particular or just the whole thing ?
well , usually they asked about some other problem that i do n't have . everything works fine , i just do n't like mysterious error messages : )
hi @ gilles thanks . i 've added the output to the question .
wo n't logrotate will replace the old file on each run ? i want two files to be maintained . one will maintain the history of all the runs in syslog.old and the second will save data for a new run in syslog .
you mean i need to i need to compile from source ?
dear @ shadur the output of `` ls -lsa /usr/sbin/iptables '' is as below : [ root @ 104 / ] # ls -lsa /usr/sbin/iptables ls : /usr/sbin/iptables : no such file or directory [ root @ 104 / ] # ls -lsa sbin/iptables 68 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 60920 nov 2 2009 sbin/iptables
no . it was one of the first commands i performed after receiving my welcome email from my hosting company and then logging in via ssh . looking at my `/etc/pam.d/passwd` i notice that plesk is doing some stuff . so , i 'm going to try to work with that lead , rtfm and then come back if i have questions .
yes , i mean fake entries ...
the following is added as a response to the comment from @ goldilocks . i used `yum` all the time with fedra 12 , but when i tried it just now , in fedora 20 , this was the result : [ root @ localhost ~ ] # yum install emacs loaded plugins : langpacks , refresh-packagekit : [ errno 14 ] curl # 6 - `` could not resolve host : linuxdownload.adobe.com '' trying other mirror . error : failure : repodata/repomd.xml from adobe-linux-i386 : [ errno 256 ] no more mirrors to try . : [ errno 14 ] curl # 6 - `` could not resolve host : linuxdownload.adobe.com '' [ root @ localhost ~ ] # which all looks very strange . probably i should use `yum` differently & mdash ; my failing memory of version 12 .
i only use `date` to show the date/time , and set the date/time in the system-settings application or using `settimeofday` in a program , both settings are not working once a sudden power cut happens . should i use `hwclock -- systohc` ?
yes i 'm . my router ( not a server with a site ) have a public ip ( maybe i mistakenly called it the `` white '' )
so , the kernel just starts off with the minimum required system-reserved memory at first and this can grow ? similarly , as and when processes need to start ( be it from a startup script or manually ) , the kernel calculates and assigns virtual addresses to the processes if they would fit ? of course , all this is just from theory , i 've never looked at the actual kernel code .
hi @ cristianciupitu , those files need to be readable by apache ? that means should give `` r '' to group . is it supposed secure ?

updated question ...
that 's kinda the point of my question . i 'm not blaming bash . i want to know how people have configured it to their liking .
edit ( clarification ) : i 'm interested in how to do this primarily in darwin and linux , but also in netbsd .
added edit with results .
i ran `synclient clickfinger2=2` for that to happen . note , however , the problem seems to have nothing to do with that setting since it happens even after i run `synclient clickfinger2=0` .
just a regular home /24 network
. commands are executed as root . symlinks are allowed across partitions . i can successfully edit the /etc/group file by hand without problem .
the script does read command line arguments from argv . is that not possible to do with a background job ?
am not yet past it . it 's a major roadblock to building gnome on lfs for me .
lenovo ideapad s12
i edited the post !
distro is arch and card is intel
yes , i am sure the conditions are what i want . only files deeper than a depth of 2 should be deleted . my questions is if find can do the deletion immediately after testing a file , instead of collecting files that satisfy the conditions and then deleting in the end .
i am not sure where to get those logs , could they be here ? /var/log/xorg.0.log i will get back to you later today .
: where is the root `.bashrc` located ?
-- i have been trying to look for such a plugin for some time now ! ! i took a look at [ taglist.vim ] ( but it seems to need exuberant ctags which suggests to me that it would not be suitable for my purpose , since i am tagging free-form text . i did try to use it anyways but it did not work ( it only opened the side pane with an error message and no tags from the tags file in the current working directory ) .
i am on 'red hat enterprise linux server release 5.5 ( tikanga ) ' . can you point for the options for `head` and `tail` you know of on different flavours ?
i 've added the config files . there is nothing obvious in `/var/log/messages` . is there anywhere else i should look or commands i should run when its in this state .
i 'm open to all solutions , but ideally i would be able to add the solution as a bash alias without installing anything to ` $ home/bin` . even better would be a one-liner that i could bang out from memory and impress my colleagues with ! i 'll be using this from a few terminals sshed into a few different servers .
, why is that
yes , if i tailor the kill script to always return 'success ' , the script in `/etc/rc.4` runs successfully
it 's empty ... ..
for server administration purposes .
nothing unusual in /var/log/syslog , kern.log , nor dmesg unfortunately .
`xev` reports : keypress event , serial 33 , synthetic no , window 0x1200001 , root 0x13c , subw 0x0 , time 36080759 , ( -557,202 ) , root : ( 187,223 ) , state 0x0 , keycode 133 ( keysym 0xff20 , multi_key ) , same_screen yes , xlookupstring gives 0 bytes : xmblookupstring gives 0 bytes : xfilterevent returns : true keyrelease event , serial 33 , synthetic no , window 0x1200001 , root 0x13c , subw 0x0 , time 36080859 , ( -557,202 ) , root : ( 187,223 ) , state 0x0 , keycode 133 ( keysym 0xff20 , multi_key ) , same_screen yes , xlookupstring gives 0 bytes : xfilterevent returns : false
never used it . if there 's not an easy way to do it i 'll have to kill and restart ; not a huge deal just thought there might be something simple i did n't know about .
edit : well i did install debian after win8 , but my main issue was that i installed debian over win8 . so grub did n't find win8 , because win8 was n't there anymore .
: no , not using compiz . a fairly standard/default debian install . only deviation from default was using mate .
i think yes . check here : should i upgrade bios ? i never did it before with this motherboard ...
i am saying that `dd bs=1000000 count=10 if=/dev/random of=/tmp/random` results in a file containing less than 200 bytes . now do you understand why `dd` is n't the right tool for the job ?
i tried but got some error when it tried to start about missing iso file ( $ isofile or something ) . i did n't format the yumi install so maybe a conflict ... trying again properly now ...
i added the commands .
yes all my devices are in the same network
mounting `/dev/sdb` gives an error message ( iirc , a file system ca n't be found ) . i had also tried with `-t vfat` , but this did n't work either .
to answer my own question i looked at freenas and openmediavault . freenas gave me issues with its latest version and integration with nextcloud . openmediavault seems to be a little better with nextcloud , but i have yet to test it . i have to do some more testing between the two of them , but freenas was basically exactly what i was looking for . now only to get the latest version working with nextcloud and i 'll be good to go .
assignment is a simple command .
i 'm not sure . admittedly , i 'm new to this . also , i do n't have root permissions . my objective is to launch the cadence eda program via command line . normally , when i 'm on campus on a linux machine , i access the servers via ssh . if i 'm at home ( off-campus ) , i use nomachine or xmanager on windows to launch the redhat desktop environment which enables me to pull up the terminal and launch the eda software .
yes , but `/etc/network/interface.new` does not exist too
no something more like network namespace but simpler .
yes , a blank line
command dd used to take slices but using it based on number of lines or blocks ( could not find a way to use it base on time . ) so have to know from which line to which line have to take the slice and this method take some time : example : dd if=o.log of=d.log skip=47615 count=50 bs=100
, updated with link , thanks for calling that to my attention . sorry , i was reposting a question from a botched migration from superuser to askubuntu , which i did n't realize did n't include ubuntu-based distros like mint . i could n't click 'edit ' anymore and copied the rendered text , which did n't include the link .
update : thanks for everyone 's suggestion and advice . these servers are all going to be used as internal dev servers . there is n't going to be any outside access to these machines so security is n't a high concern to us . our current servers that we are using all ( to the best of my knowledge ) do not have selinux enabled . some of the ones my manager just acquired do and those are the ones we 're looking at disabling so everything in our cluster is uniform .
how do you make it not recompile files that are not changed since the last compilation ?
yes it 's 1 second and should be noact ok noact not notact . thank for the help , i will try the script
# # # update # 1 i want to write a high performance key value store for ssds and so i need some way to do low level access ( including read , write and erase ) . i know that my approach must be kernel level , but before that i want to test it out in user-space ( avoiding the complexity of learning kernel level programming ) .
i do n't have any problem with `utf-8` , my problem is with the `alt` keys .
host is os x running vmware fusion 5.0
jason , i do not have pacman on my other machine , and i would rather not download another package manager . plus if i was not building from source i would not have this wonderful opportunity to learn about m4 and automake . sorry about the bad edit , i removed it . yes , that is the whole sequence of errors . i retrieved the source from the archlinux website at projects.archlinux.org/pacman.git with wget .
how can i give you that ? sorry i am new
, no , i do n't have even a folder called adwaita in /usr/share/themes .
. i have n't tested that yet , however , i think it may be a hardware problem . my case is damaged and , i notice if the screen is pushed back too far , it happens . : /
ah , sorry for the confusion . there 's just plenty of layers of networks and subnets . i meant the intranet dns , i do not have access to . i have access to a what 's on our system which is an appliance . the appliance itself has a dns by legacy means . the appliance dns is all i can configure , but has no knowledge of any public addresses , but the intranet dns does , which is where i need to get addresses from .
here 's what i 've tried so far : awk ' { for ( i = 1 ; i < = nf ; i++ ) f [ i ] = f [ i ] `` `` $ i ; if ( nf > n ) n = nf } end { for ( i = 1 ; i < = n ; i++ ) sub ( /^ */ , `` '' , f [ i ] ) ; for ( i = 1 ; i < = n ; i++ ) print f [ i ] } ' failed.csv > tgt_failed.out
no i 'm using touchscreen : p this is a just an idea : i mean i do n't have such power full phone now , however i guess it not difficult to connect a usb keyboard to a phone through its mini usb
no , once `nsenter`'ed into the processes namespace you have no access to the outside directory you want to mount .
i 've tried , but it did not work as well
centos 7
hi , actually there are multiple occurence of `` set trans_id [ string range $ recv 42 43 ] '' line in a file but i need to replace only the lines just after cast $ recv $ ue_capability_enquiry . yes garbage is just for example
no , the lines are not unique . the only information is that the two same line number strings are corresponding . for example the line 10 from file a and the line 10 from file b are comparable .
i just added 20 gbyte of swap , before that i did not have swap . however , i am working on a 32bit system , which might cause problems ( i already have 4 gbyte of ram ) .
i was . that 's why it was so odd i could n't add a principal .
the interface is up and running , wlan0 is capable of going into monitor mode , seeing traffic , injections , etc.. i can only use ettercap with eth0 , but not with wlan0 . maybe it 's a problem with the files , libnet or ec_network.c
: for example , the context menu of a track in [ quod libet ] ( it contains the entry `` edit tags '' , which i want to become bigger than the other entries . i figured that if its possible at all , the solution should work for all gtk+ programs in the same way , so i didnt include the specific program in my question . is this a wrong assumption ?
yes , both the display adapters are integrated on the mainboard . i am sure that both the adapters are active in the bios as when i reboot with both screens plugged , the right screen is active and shows the boot process . i 'm not able to run x.org on the screen though .
: also , for some context , see this
: hmm , i did n't realise `getent` also looks in dns ( i thought it only looks in `/etc/hosts` ) . now that i 've tried it , here 's what 's wrong with `getent` : for `google.com` , it returns a single address , and that address is ipv6 . which is not helpful , since i 'm on an ipv4 network , and my command would actually print an ipv4 address .
yes
i am using cisco ios ( version : ios xe 3.10.4s )
added .
i removed all stickers , but i believe my computer is to old for uefi and i 've had linux running on this machine for a couple of years . this problem has only come up recently . maybe since linux has adapted to uefi , but i ca n't tell for sure .
[ passwordstore ] ( is a encrypted password db .
i had some unstable version , i guess . did n't really pay attention , just pulled down a copy from cvs . i ended up getting version 2012.11 and everything builds fine !
i 've found which by trial and error , killing a few things until something ( a wine app ) released the grab .
yes , it works , but i want the second line .
it is intel , centrino advanced-n +wimax 6250 driver iwlwifi
but i 'd need to wrap all cron jobs , and whenever someone adds a new job they 'd have to remember to wrap again . it 'd be much better to have a general solution .
because defaults /sbin/init neither works .
i think i did what you said i kill gnome-shell with kill command but everything gone crazy .after force shutdown it wo n't log in to my system .
okay , so after further investigation i have found that it is infact *not* the long line lengths causing the problem . however , what i have found is an issue with the header of the file . i have updated the post to reflect my findings
yep , i restart the daemon after the changes manually .
`` spiffy program '' ? what it means ? ( english is not my first language.. and the translations i found for `` spiffy '' does n't make sense.. )
after running `autorun.sh` the card still does n't work , so i assumed that the install failed .
`dovecot` removed . i have gnu `mailutils` package on my system .
simple answer : i need it for a project , a kernel , that is installed on a machine , does a lot other things than plain forwarding that i am configuring in my kernel . forwarding seems to be a pain . very little documentation is available for a lot of linux kernel features .
please find the expected details . if required i will share the entire script which i have written.thanks
they are specifically full path names between each alternating delimiter . i am hesitant to release a full example because i am working with sensitive scientific information .

i would , but i am not sure how to go about generating test data ( and if i did , i 'd like to test it out on a nice range to see whether `cmp` is faster for some file sizes ) .
yep , it worked rsync -a dira/ dirb : p
i do n't have this file on my system but i did n't check any other log files .
debian sid , running xfce . i would prefer to have the shortcut run regardless of whether or not x / xfce has been started though ( i sometimes use the machine as a server ) . which is why i thought inittab might work .
pretty much , its like `` ( root '' and `` ( . . ) ) ) '' . this is a sentence parsed using the stanford parser . if i can write one for the simpler case i can modify it for the specific case .
yes , it does . i also tried just booting with the integrated card . and i added that parameter and i still get the same issue .
if you are asking why i want to remove the links it 's because i made a mistake and given i 'm getting too many levels of symbolic links i need to resolve the issue . if you are referring to why i 'd want to move my dotfiles out of my home directory in the first place and then link them back it 's because i was putting them into a git repo to prepare for setting up another machine .
, no vidir available on my server ( i can not install new software ) .
i do n't understand the phrase `` add the share as a disk in kvm '' , so i ca n't respond to the question . in fedora , i 'm using samba to ( hopefully ) establish a specific directory that i can access while using windows 7 in a virtual machine ( i.e . fedora=host , win7=guest ) . as described in my original posting , i am failing . since the windows 7 access is totally within the virtual machine , i ca n't think of any other way to do this . please advise .
i have since stopped using mutt and now use mu4e ( mu for emacs ) . i will go ahead and answer this question though .
it 's the default amazon linux , which is based on red hat enterprise linux and later linux-xen-kernel .
the glibc categorization was done by me when i originally submitted the bugzilla .
not necessarily , but i need the path and other environment variables set for wibble to be available to everyone who runs commands *as* wibble

i 'm running gnome 3. sorry , i should have included that in the question .
-- logging in works fine ; normally i log in via serial console as in this example , but ssh works as well ( and has the same behavior ) .
you tell me ^^ ?
in the interest of saving some time , every ps option shows `` bash/bash '' , not `` running_script '' when `running_script` is stared from the command line /terminal .
regrettably , no `-m` . i have `-m` ( small case `` m '' ) , but that 's described as `` send mail to the user when the job has completed , even if there was no output . ''

it 's not an english question - i see this only in plain text mediums , eg ttys and txt documents . if it were n't in that scenario , then the font would change the quote parentheses to opening and closing quotes , like `` and `` ( mirrorred )
i do n't think this is such a weird arrangement . i want the screens on either side of my main work machine . the idea is that i 'm going to put my client screens in portrait mode flanking my server screen
it would be when attempting to execute a file/binary . i think @ siblynx got it . that 's pretty much what i figured but you got me going in the right direction . thank you , sir .
ifs is a data example , im corrected data
i did run gentoo only on my desktop and servers , did choose sabayon for my laptop . to install sabayon via gentoo is more time consuming than to install via iso . so , yes , i could , but i only need secure verification , which should not take more than 1 minute to do .
`install` allows custom setting of uid/gid and access mode , creation of directories in the path , safe handling of existing files , along with binary stripping - for my application all of these features were critical - it just chokes on symlinks . `ln` does none of those things .
hmm , i tryied to make bad main.cpp and i tried to compile it `` g++ main.cpp > & out '' . errors from this are in out . my $ shell is /bin/csh . maybe script makeall do something strange and csh ca n't redirect some of output to file .
thak you . i 'm using different editors , mostly geany , gedit , vim , libreoffice , but also pinta ... i 'm not sure about owncloud either ( see comment [ below ] (
it does n't work with my desktop or my laptop , both which have worked in the past . the only similarity is that they 're both running manjaro right now , but i do n't see how that would affect this .
merged columns 9-16 become `` notes '' so may include whitespaces . as of today there are 16 columns but this may evolve in more/less if required . eventually column 9 ( concatenated 9-16 ) becomes `` notes '' field .
hampton i 'll post it later . i live in belgium , my isp is telenet .
this is what `lspci` has to say about the nvidia device `` 04:00.0 3d controller : nvidia corporation gf117m [ geforce 610m/710m/820m / gt 620m/625m/630m/720m ] ( rev a1 ) ''
yes , after the script finishes executing , i have to manually go back there , attach it back to my screen , and exit from it .
the folder has a name 'withdeb ' , there is nothing similar in output
sorry if this was a stupid question from your point of view - i 'm a java programmer by trade and have suddenly found myself needing to do a bit of linux admin . hence the reason i asked the question .
so terminal emulators include network latency in their interface ? they show my keystrokes on the screen only at the time those keystrokes are actually reaching the remote server ?
file too big for the exchange server , the limit is 10mg and the file is 14mg
i 've tried : skype , pavucontrol ( just to check if there is any input , no luck ) and built-in alsa tool ( arecord or aplay , i do not recall now ) .
: unfortunately i can not access shell - `/sbin/init` starts a `repl-like` program that can not be killed with `c-c` and `c-z` . i can only access this kernel 's `rootfs` shell through another kernel using `nfsroot` and pointing to the `rootfs` in question but the problem is that there are many errors when loading modules because kernels are in a different version .
of course i could write a script or bash alias to touch it before starting multitail , although i 've never tried to run mapserver with an already present logfile ( it should append results to it ) ; i 'm searching for a more `` clean '' solution or a specific multitail feature , but , yes .
first group is the concatenation of the fields from 2 to 7 , of the first four lines . then repeat for each line with the same first field . second group is the concatenation of the fields from 2 to 7 , from the following two lines . then repeat for each line with the same first field . third group is the concatenation of the fields from 2 to 7 , from the last two lines . then repeat for each line with the same first field . it 's hard to explain..and my english is poor .
- i was just reading this : can you tell what which 32-bit packages i need to install based on the symlinks in the workaround ?
the assignment is still wrong : gb0==eth1 & gb1==eth0 . its like the changes i made in the file are not applied . i do n't have any trace of rename5 in /etc/udev/rules.d/ . what i understand is when kernel boot eth0 and eth1 are boot but udev switch them . eth0 = > eth1 and eth1 = > eth0
user @ remotemachine : path on yyy type fuse.sshfs ( rw , nosuid , nodev , max_read=65536 )
you nailed it ! yes , the file was on an nfs mount , rather than the local file system . using a local file , it flies . thanks .
thanks a lot , its working now .
this is sbatch array job . it only accept file names with numbers
both . i mean red and green for removals etc . only that the diff output is already saved to a text file . so i want to vizualize that text file with red and green for removals etc .
it has a static ip . i 'm not that familiar with printing -- would i need a ppd file for my printer or a generic hp one ( or an even more generic one ) ? considering that printing only pdfs is acceptable , does that mean i can just use the ppd `` interface '' or driver ... i 'm still not 100 % sure what a ppd is .
i am asking how a command is executed with and without `bash -c` in shell . part of the information that can help to answer my previous questions and
, let us put this issue aside for right now , you are most likely correct . my biggest three questions are : 1 ) should i delete mylinuxtest.dll before copying it from monodevelop xamarin 2 ) should i rename default.aspx and default.aspx.cs to their capital leading letter equivalent 3 ) should i remove or change default.aspx.designer.cs ? thanks .
tried that , see updated question : (
they are nfs mounts
edit : with tmux : ~ $ echo $ term screen without tmux : ~ $ echo $ term xterm
when i 'm trying to install the pcre ( 8.35 ) for the apache server , it displays me that did n't find a c++ compiler .
from what i understand , this only applies to existing files , if the server does not support the cifs unix extensions ( which it seems mine did ) .
`eval` is required to resolve the brace expansion : ` { 2.. $ last } ` . `echo` alone does __not__ accept a variable either as starting or ending value in braces expansion . see also post # 170 here : certainly , `eval` can be avoided by just specifying an arbitrary value ( like `100` ) , but i *did* want to match `last` to the *actual* last volume .
i did n't have that file or `thermald` ; installing it and starting the service led to much the same error message as for `fancontrol` . running `sudo journalctl -xn` , as suggested , gave me `dts zone /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/name does n't exist` , `no thermal zones found` as well as `no thermal sensors found` .
tried but no luck ...
different range of addresses , so i will have to ask our network admin . how could i catch the response from the dhcp see if it contains both the ip lease and gateway ?
here 's the output of the `route` command : route kernel ip routing table destination gateway genmask flags metric ref use iface default 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0 ug 0 0 0 eth0 link-local * 255.255.0.0 u 1000 0 0 eth0 192.168.0.0 * 255.255.248.0 u 0 0 0 eth0
, i tried to share public key but it fails to connect . the network administrator explained me later that the routing configuration blocks public key use .
it 's a topology of some windows machines . the command is ran through cygwin . the topology itself almost always contains a number of machines on a lan subnet and a most time a single machine that acts as a dmz . firewalling and network traffic allows them to communicate with one another . one machine runs the script which creates the new file and then it gets copied to the other ones .
edit : thank you all for the help ! since the problem stopped i can not provide more details or try your suggestions but i will do the next time it occurs . interestingly , i get a different output from `uname -a` today ( `` localhost '' instead of `` localhost.localdomain '' ) but maybe that is because i did an update with my package manager : linux localhost 3.6.8-1-arch # 1 smp preempt mon nov 26 22:10:40 cet 2012 x86_64 gnu/linux
ideally something that can replace excel for basic tasks , but something that can output a spreadsheet with decent formatting would be great .
1. logs do not indicate anything with clamd , only c-icap said it could not contact or connect to clamd . 2. it appears it was restarted by systemd now so i do n't see any exit codes . 3. here is the service file i wrote , maybe it is not correct , originally , it had restart=on-failure .
indeed . i suppose it 's more of a question of whether it 's third party code or our code . but since very similarly presenting errors occur in both , i 've gone looking for tools to shed light . you mentioned `valgrind` for this ; i 'll do my due googling , but do you have a favored reference for this type of query ?
i dont use this to bind a software to a machine , it is linux mining rig that need to identify itself to cloud control and monitoring service , instead of naming thousands of rig manually , i need to uniquely identify them using their hardware id
no , it seems to be getting deleted .
i 'm sorry , i had linked to the wiki page but apparently i 'm not allowed to add links ? i 've made it explicit .
in case a zero-day or other exploit is run against the database to prevent it from accessing _anything_ else . i trust linux `cgroups` , but not _that much_ . it 's better to be safe than sorry , i 'd rather have mysql locked down than have a mysql zero-day find a way to break out of a cgroup .
ssh ing is refused before i specify the user name . i can ping and tracert .
in theory yes , i 'm using -av -- delete . however it lists files and directories even if they have n't had any change .
: i found this question in a book . i did not get any error message on running the command
i find if i boot to a text mode , it works as expected . i get +1 if moving one direction and -1 ( ffff ) when moving the other . so , is it a problem with lxde ?
system updates , file downloads , really everything else . most importantly , if i tunnel all of the system traffic i lose the ability to contact it with ssh .
my apologies . i did n't think it was important . i updated it now .
will `date` on a system running `ntpd` ensure that my date is synced properly ?
if i write this command as echo $ ( jq '.rev_component_co.mode ' r1.txt ) in terminal of remote machine its showing the exact result but if i write in script and try to execute its showing error as `` jq : r1.txt : no such file or directory '' .
actually i can , but i 'm not going to use gdm in my application . so , i have to do this without x11 .
it actually works if i try to connect via browser to an ip which is n't in the same network ( 192.168.10.10/24 ) . but when i try to connect to something like `` google.com '' or `` 192.168.0.10 '' it does n't work ... could somebody help me please ?
this is true - it 's more typical to be a module , but you ca n't count on it .
yeah fedorqui . it will be always one file for ab* , another for dg1* and one for dg2*
i just posted the last lines of `dmesg` as an edit to my original question
why not make sense ? i have a package and want to update/replace the package with any new version . however , some files in the destination folder have been edited , i want to avoid replacing them to miss edited content . i want to protect them from being replace while can be edited .
checksctp says checksctp : protocol not supported subo modprobe sctp fatal : module sctp not found . but i when i try sudo modprobe xt_sctp it loads the driver dont know what that is .
thanks for all the comments . after reading the comment on the whirlpool forum i installed utorrent server edition . this seems to have completely solved the problem . thanks for all the help people !
: looks like that 's the issue . if you promote your comment to an answer i 'll accept that .
that 's right ! i completely forgot about the `uname` ... thanks !
thanks . it 's not a read only disk - i just created the file . i posted the result of `strace` , but i 'm not to sure whats going on there .
no `shift+insert` does n't work .
based on [ craig sanders 's answer ] [ 1 ] and the previous workaround , i ended up with this : diff -u \ `` $ ( [ -e `` $ path1 '' ] & & echo `` $ path1 '' || echo /dev/null ) '' \ `` $ ( [ -e `` $ path2 '' ] & & echo `` $ path2 '' || echo /dev/null ) '' [ 1 ] :
**solved** the network cable was defective . i switched it out and it works again .
-- if instead of hitting ctrl-r again after clearing the line , i hit enter , then i can search for `` ls foo '' again
yes i did run both apt-get update and upgrade .
no . e.g . i created a new file , entered 8000 instances of one character - 'du -ah ' shows that this file has 8 kb size .
well i do n't see the output of the script . ps : i 'm logging with ssh-rsa key , if it matters
no . should i ?
mac . where do i put this -i.bak ? ? ? ?
i do n't understand how that helps . how do i get the raspbian autobuilders to use that branch ?
- 85 mb per each file - can u show me and tutorial in python + celementtreeto handle this case - how to fix this ibm issue ? thanks for all
i did n't configure anything in pavucontrol . and what do i do in alsamixer ?
: i added an example , thanks for the idea . and , to answer your question , the only delimiter is a varying amount of spaces .
we are capturing `sip.pcap` for troubleshooting .
: i have n't worked with rsync before so there will be some learning curve for me . i would like to learn it but given the time frame i have , i thought its best to do using `ssh` .
can you clarify how to do that ? is it done this way ?
: yes , the partition is mounted just fine . other binaries on the same partition can be executed without any trouble .
: it 's a `` local '' disk . vmware guest using a scsi disk provided by a datastore backed by fibre channel san . ls does n't give any errors other than the notices of `` no such file '' i believe bowlofred has the correct answer . i 'll check for filesystem corruption during my next maintenance window though just to be sure .
nope . seems to be the mouse reacting very slowly to whatever the computer asks it when booting . the delay goes away when i have a xbox 360 controller attached , though . really strange ...
i do n't think i can switch to vt ... i 'll try again next time it hangs with a black screen .
files i have to mod ( /etc/ ... ) 3. a basic configuration example i do n't have any particular requirement i just need to set up this service in order to get it work . ( so any suggested kind of vpn that can suit this is accepted ) .
yes , i am sure . ls -b actually does n't even escape the pipe : it shows file\ |\ with\ pipe.png .
no , i look for a way to check in milliseconds if there are pending upgrades
updates : `git add *` did n't work either `git status` looks normal
, no it is not . `begin` and `fin` are intended to be the extreme times of a given interval . if the times are not within the intervals , then the condition is not satisfied .
i had 3.5.3 but i just installed 3.5.4.2 and have the same problem .
files are tab delimited , the header of only the non-blank columns are to be retained .
: this is a brand new install of centos and this is the 3rd time i have done a re-install i can guarantee that this is not a corrupt install . i will post the contents of `/etc/yum.repo.d/*` in the original post .
the benign reason is that i forgot my root password . i changed it to something really complicated . logged off . forgot it . instead of trying to remember or reset , i liked the idea of brute forcing and took it as an interesting challenge .
i am trying to use the vmware 2.2.0.1
i found an issue with escaping . actually , the program was called but due to wrong parameters it stopped again silently . while still searching for a log file i changed the exec to `exec=command2 `` a text parameter '' ` . command2 does not exist and i get no error message .
yes , same output .
as you see it in the image . i thought it was two threads but they have a different pid , but if you shut one down , the other goes , which to me is more like threads ?
yes , it works ok with other cds and dvds . i also added `sudo addgroup $ user disk sudo addgroup $ user cdrom`
i do n't know what that is -- i did the stock debian 6 'desktop ' install . how can i find out ?
: sure , i guess it would be the most likely culprit . i cant see anything that looks related to a networking issue via `dmesg` , although im not currently experiencing the issue , so ill check it again if/when it recurs . ive got a support call in with vmware , so hopefully the problem will be found there and we can close this question off .
@ terdon `lshw` & `hwinfo` commands are not there . and i have root privilege , i can install s/w
see edit no . 4 , it shows `vim /etc/security/limits.conf` and `/etc/security/limits.d` does not contain any file .
i use grub . yes i can access the bios
thanks . added the information .
thats the problem , i got `kill -sigstop ... ` on a process that was using 130 % cpu ( 4core max would be 400 % i think ) , the cpu load went from 4.2 to 2.8 , and in the list of process using cpu it shows several applications using less than 5 % cpu.. xorg using 15 % .. my guess is the load is elsewhere , not something i can guess by reading cpu percentuals . i got about 18 `xterm` running on a single viewport on compiz , each with its script for monitoring and other tasks ; one of them had fast/high text output , i modified it and helped on lowering the load ; but the others refresh each 5 seconds ; what i do ?
+lese `` systemd-analyze blame '' just do that and it should print out all of it

question updated , but there are machines with several oslevels
i switched from ide to ahci but then i couldnt boot from the cd . so i switched back to ide . should i try booting from a usb ?
apparently not . i have this message `warning : the foobar variable is not set . defaulting to a blank string.`
, it happens at random . i ca n't start any application from the gnome terminal since it ca n't be started .
i have revised the question . please check and let me know if you need any further details .
yes i watch it all the way , shuts every thing off then begins right where a normal cold boot would
in `session and startup` - > `advanced` tab , i have `launch gnome services on startup` checked , but `launch kde services on startup` is unchecked . could that be interfering ?
on putty it gets logged out inmediately . on winscp it gets a `` authentication failed '' message .
wow ! you 're looking deep inside the thing ! my grep version is `grep ( gnu grep ) 2.5.1` i use it through cygwin in fact . what matters is that i needed this thing ponctually and it worked , so it is ok for me : ) but i understand that you want to know why ... !
i am just haing problems with case zero , so yes sets works just not case 0 )
duh . i just received two comments : thank you very much ! i lost my contact with the website . yes , if i had still been on the editing page i would have no trouble . but the machine `` decided '' that i was finished editing this paper ( so i wound up with the `` bad one ''
thanks for the information , i will explore the builder options . the main link i was following was the [ debian start guide ] ( but what you are saying is that install order is not important . my goal was just to upgrade bluez to the latest version for my own uses on my architecture . so i cloned the latest bluez , grabbed the latest 5.36 debian source folder , and ran dpkg-buildpackage . i built this on an sd card , then i just add the package to a private repository for uses on my other boards .
i know . there is no such thing as you said .
yes , i believe .
it 's a dropbox folder so the location is consistent . and it applies to *any* file dropped in that folder .
# # # query based on answer by *slm* based on the answer by @ slm , i see my xml filetypes are associated with geany . but i see them opening with chrome instead . $ xdg-mime query default application/xml geany.desktop $ as i mentioned above my `/usr/share/applications/defaults.list` file shows text/xml=google-chrome.desktop ; so what is the difference and which should override ?
. the terminator is not opening with the `` light '' profile . how can i do this ? ?

: thanks it does just found that . if you want to post it as an answer i 'll accept it .
the release is in the title . i went and bought a new computer just to install ubuntu on so i do n't think the drive is that old . and when i use 'mount ' i get an error that says /cdrom do n't exist .
at this point , i do n't think that i really need the files on the computer , but just an operating system on it . either the elementary , or some way to get back to windows 8. if anyone can help me just install any kind of os on it , i would be overjoyed . the computer is an asus x502c . when i put in `` find /boot/vmlinuz '' , it just says that `` find '' is an unknown command .
any concrete samples ?

ok i se now it runs in backround so it means that is the differece then , first one runs foreground and the second in backround right ?
my understanding is that it came with/from rpmfusion . i installed it with yum a while back .
i used printf `` % g , '' `cat $ { subj_id } /stats/aseg.stats | grep brain | awk -f , ' { printf `` % .2f\n '' , $ 4 } ` > brainvol.csv which still gives output in scientific notation 1.21079e+06 if it 's a 7777777.012345 number . am i using it in the wrong place in the pipe , given that the entire line starts with printf ?
this server is `fileserver` just like backup machine . multiple machine accessing this single linux server
, no , it is not .
this is the kernel info : uname -a linux alarm 3.8.13-35-arch # 1 smp thu sep 25 20:15:28 mdt 2014 armv7l gnu/linux
i had a general feeling that that is what one should always aim for : ) . it is n't a real requirement so far .
i have been using *nix for 20 years , but its not correct to have ./ inside the archive i am sure . i 've just been able to create an archive how i want it using gnome 's file-roller - which is ok for a quick manual update - but i wanted to automate the process via a git-hook and that needs a command line approach .
yes , i did . both , actually , in that order .
i have only one column in a test file . each row is a string where slash appears only once .
yes it is not current , my appliction is base on centos 6.5. the application 's iso rpms are centos kernel and many other rpms related to the application .
. additional data : - using bash shell . - tested in ubuntu desktop and ubuntu server v14.04 lts . - tested in a portable asus eee pc and on virtualbox virtual machine . - i use to add the `export ps1=` line at `~/.bashrc`
but i can not set a static route on the isp gateways . for example if the lan1 gateway is isp_g1 , then i can not cross to lan2 . as such if a client on lan1 pings lan2 , isp_g1 will not know what to do with the packet . adding a static route manually for each client is not a viable option . people should just connect and be ready to go via dhcp . thanks .
it 's not just `find` , i may want to use an `ls` or `ls | grep` .
, yes , just did n't want to mess around with the backup script , but that is my next tactic if i ca n't get this to work .
i have 3 different distros and one win install . i can choose in which one to boot at startup thanks to grub . well , at least it was that way , now it seems i messed up .
why not ? . @ muru
a . 50 $ - 100 $ . batteries or 220v are ok .
no new line or other special characters
well it is codded like that . i did n't do that . what is your thoughts about it ?
i tried running terminator from source but failed ( maybe because of my unfamiliarity with bazaar ) . where should i ask for help with this , here on stack exchange or somewhere on launchpad ?
via ssh to the device .
`file * | grep -v elf` will work if there are no other options , but i 'd prefer to list them with file size and rights but exclude the executables .

yes , my system uses uefi .
yes . in the above example , i do n't want it to return `` barfoo '' . this is one example though . i want to be able to apply any of the regex symbols to the basename of a file and return the wholename
there is no fnlock key , enabling/disabling numlock does not affect the behaviour . i am using only the laptop keyboard .
: all three interfaces have a netmask of 255.255.255.0. each interface is on a different subnet . since this machine is being built on amazon web services ( aws ) within a single vpc , they share a common ( virtual ) vpc router .
: yes , i was looking for lines that begin with invoker_slark . so that means even invoker_slarkaslkjfd is a valid result . but not invoker_slardar .
thank you for your comment . i have updated the question with the specific case and the general one .
yes , the last text on the line is always a number .
please , see the answer why i am using `find -l` .
: i tried . there 's already busybox present in the os , but it does n't contain ifplugd . i 'm currently trying to get a new version , but opkg refuses to download it .
yes , i 'm quite sure i did n't move them to a different filesystem . i just moved them up a level .
as @ mat has pointed out , i would need a compiler for that , and afaict , there 's no c compiler on this machine . sigh .
yeah , carl9170 is open-source , but i always have terrible luck compiling code , plus the version numbers of my `` normal use '' computer and the chrome os 's kernels are different .
edited , to be honest was n't entirely sure this i the most appropriate place to ask , but hopefully ?
the issue might have gone away after my last updates , needing to check the versions etc , which i ca n't do right now . if you happen to have a specific reason during march and now which might be a bugreport or similiar , feel free to answer with that . if not , i will post an answer tomorrow with details of the changes and possibly trying to revert until i find the exact fix .
-- -- -- -- -- **update** i do not think is a hardware issue . i am able to access ( write , delete , create , decompress , etc ) all other files . although , i can not access the problematic files .
i do n't know , maybe im wrong . why does n't the attempted script work ? ? plz ...
edit : i have kde , gnome , lxde . the problem persists if i change desktop environment . **edit** after upgrading the kernel to 3.2.65-1+deb7u1 suspend works but not hibernate . i installed uswsusp package and now hibernate works . thanks to all helping me to solve this annoying bug .
i already did in order to check for hard- and symbolic links , but they are regular files . please see my comment to the eval answer . i ca n't explain why this is that way and if there 'd be a way to use the original cp command with an * , but if you can i 'd like to accept your answer as you were a big help already .
i posted the values of webgl config !
yes . home is encrypted . application process is started by home owner . encrypted home is automatically disabled ?
well i am building a notebook in html5 so will use firefox . not sure if i am able to download stuff like `save` via an external handler like wget ... this notebook is a nice thing btw , and the issue described is the last one left .
yes , i did install likewise thing in my system , should i uninstall it ? can i just disable it ?
i 'm not sure what you mean . there 's no mail client involved , really .

perl wont be supported by our platform any other option using sed or awk
i thought network manager used /etc/network/interfaces if you told it to using _auto_ eth0 . no network manager does n't work after modprobe e1000 . i put that in /etc/modules , too . also , i did n't run the installer ; i just put the hard drive into the new machine .
no , other `` quick and dirty '' tools are fine as well , it was just that sed looked like the most straightforward at first . actually stphane 's answer showed that lots of other tools works just as well .
currently i have no access to the machine to list /bin/sleep , but we replaced sudo with su and then it works , so access rights should be no problem .

yes , i just edited my post .
oh right , forgot to mention it . i 'm using mate , so all gnome stuff should work .
updated , still i do n't get where should be the problem

so far , what do you think of the problem ? i wish to get some response as well as the result , however i got nothing in return .
i just ran the application and saw it..it 's a wrongful replacement of the greek character .
exact , @ polym . that 's what i meant . however , i joined an edit to my question , i hope it 's a bit more clear .
i 'm looking for a list that the `` mount -t type '' supports ! all of them . so all of the thing i can put in the `` type ''
: i 'll take the hard drive outside of the case ( the connectors should be long enough ) to be sure and i 'll report back ; )
thanks for your answer .
** [ edit ] : ** to clarify , i 'm hoping someone can provide a reference of some sort which mentions the reason the actual developer ( s ) decided on the default behavior , rather than opinion-based answers . perhaps documentation or code comments exist which document this ? i see this question is currently on hold as being primarily opinion-based , so i 'm trying to make it less so .
i 'd actually prefer a more universal way , but if there is none , i could live with other solution .
it is optional .
`man -k` ( please note the capitalized `` k '' in contrast to my example above ) file-or-path is kind of what i was searching for . thanks @ cristianciupitu !
thank you , that really helped , i had a script named `` x.sh ''
works fine , i am just curious about this white-space thing , because the output of the command is strangely shiftet to the right , and i fought i might be able to catch it with the \w whitespace-class , but it does not work . i wanted to use the grepped names as input to apt-get in order to install all the missing ones automatically .
`lang` is set to `en_us.utf-8` , so i do n't think there 's any troubles there . i 'm not trying to set anything else to dutch just trying to get pacman to output in it .
update : ====== i expected it will go without saying , that i need the match to be colored . so getting rid of ` -- color=always` is not a solution for me .
that 's really interesting . i wish i had known about that command earlier . i still have no idea what to do with that info ... .
-- { } + at the end did n't really work : something like : i can only use { } once -delete works good : exec : 3 - 5 minutes delete : 2 seconds and the server load is drastically reduced , which i 'm after .
**clarification : ** i have two panel buttons that start separate firefox profiles . these use `` firefox -- no-remote -p `` thisorthatprofile '' % u '' . if i omit any other parameters and just supply `` -- new-window '' , it correctly starts new windows *of the default profile* ( whether that profile is already running or not ) . the thing is , i can not figure out how to start new windows *for specific ( non-default ) profiles* .
yes , that correct . those switch using different pdu/power source .
- even it does n't work using without quotes like $ ( ) .. while i am executing this script it simply display the command line output on the screen , while it should hold it and put it into new_file .
i 'm brand new to rsyslog and the corresponding logging configuration options for openssh . based on my research it looks like i just need to add : `auth , authpriv . * /var/log/auth.log` . currently this line is in the default configuration `authpriv . * /var/log/secure ` , but that does not trigger any logging . i do n't think alpine has a journald package . at least running `apk add journald` does not work ...
prevent sedutil encrypted ssd from locking .
i want write this with builtin packages and modules .
yes , the size is the same . there are two partitions : an ext4 partition mount on /boot and another one is a pv , from rootvg . inside rootvg , i have lvs for root ( `` / '' ) and swap .

hi gnouc - i could not give you the real file input because it has sensitive data . the file starts with `` rfh ^b^c^x^a^q^c3mqstr ^dx ... ... ... some text of many lines ... ..blank line ... rfh ^b^c^x^a^q^c3mqstr ^dx ... ... ..some text of many lines ... ..blank line ... rfh ^b^c^x^a^q^c3mqstr ^dx ... '' . let me know if this gives you an idea..
i 'll look into your suggestion ... thank you caleb .
: like this one ? df / awk '/^\// { print $ 5 } ' , right ?
hm , good point . i did n't know about it and i prefer to teach things that can be used in other os too . does n't mention iowait at all , i only see total disk activity of each process and current combined disk activity . speed of disks can vary wildly , so those numbers do n't help much . is there something simple which can tell me whether a process is currently cpu-bound or disk-bound ?
-- - edit . 1. the error message i get when running xchat without `tcl` installed is clearly visible in the gui , in the same place where messages are displayed . 2. my question can also be reworded in the following way : why xchat , despite having clearly been built with ` -- enable-tcl` or equivalent passed to the `configure` script , can be installed without a mandatory dependency on the `tcl` package ? if one do n't want `tcl` , he should use ` -- disable-tcl` .
any idea on how to that without an internet connection ?
i guess that 's part of the question ; it 's not about *one* script , but about all init scripts i 'll find along the way . docker-baseimage is ubuntu 14.04-based , which means that i probably will find both ( example : [ postfix init script ] (
edit : so i tried to use `expect` to select the option . after googling around , i 'm doing it like this : ` expect < spawn titanium build -p ios -t device heredoc > expect `` select a certificate by number or name '' heredoc > send `` 1\r '' heredoc > eod ` however , instead of sending `` 1 '' as input , it shows a `` % '' instead . anyone know why ?
what is that ?

it appears it 's failing to start eth0 because it times out .
sorry i dont understand the question . what does applicative login mean ? if i am unable to make an ssh connection for a period of time but am then able to without any intervention from me , where would i look in the logs to see what prevented me from logging in ?

`git submit` is used to merge the changes to origin/master so that if some one does `git update` he will get all the new changes to his local repository .

i 'm forced to maintain unique names . these are op 's research papers , and if i change the name , then , for example , i ca n't be sure i 'm not reading something i 've already read . the changes are typically annotations to pdfs , so it 's also important to not reread something i 've already read .

no we turn nm off almost as fast as we sign in the first time - gets in the way . no when i run dhclient on eth0 there is n't already a dhclient running it - i usually do it on boot and even if somehow it already had one i usually run a killall somewhere in there .
any of them . think of all the struct whatever 's in the c library that you sooner or later need to be non-opaque . not to mention the various whatever_t 's different functions need . is there a way better than `grep -rl whatever /usr/include` to figure out where these are defined and what they are defined as ?

jackman actually both , i 'm moving a couple of things around like crazy .
the default shell command is stored inside the variable $ shell , i called using eval , also i 've tried using `/bin/bash -i` but it would show this error `bash : can not set terminal process group ( 1792 ) : inappropriate ioctl for device` and then show the interactive-shell but it is n't the same as usual that 's i wanted to re-invoke the original behaviour

if not , what can i expect to be the same and what can i expect to change ?
yes , right . i thought ls | sort would show those files at the beginning . -.slice is shown between sleep and slices . thanks a lot !
: i 'd much rather have a program keep feeding 'y ' to e2fsck than having to type it over and over again when there are file system errors .
same as original error , yes
i 'm not using remmina 's product . i downloaded the vnc from realvnc.com
exactly . the probleme is that in the file , there are different numbers of blank before the first field

i understand the need for the local cache , my problem is that it seems to be reset whenever i want to install something new . i would expect the cache to stay populated for longer periods of time . usually , when i would want to install something new the next day , `apt-get` will tell me it 's unable to locate the package .
a multiple pasting tool ( cli configurated ) would be ok .
it 's -rw-r -- r -- . no problem .
i can use it on my sony camera .
sir , i have checked it but not able to make a script .if u can show me the format according to my need then it will be very helpul to me ..
yes , it should be on /dev/sd5 . command finds nothing .
absolutelly right . it does not change __at all__
i 've added info on permissions .
no matter how..
the question is `` why not ? `` : ) there will be millions of these ( kind of ) devices around the world , so why not share it with others ? tl ; dr academic research .
doesnt have to be java but its the language i prefer . i will look into network manager and wicd . thank you !
they are each a different line . sorry for the messy example . not sure how to best format in here .
edit : i 've done : watch -n 1 cat /proc/meminfo ... to see how the memory changes particularly looking at the dirty row and the writeback row which i believe is the hds disk buffer . they all stay at zero for the most part highest being probably 300kb . calling sync flushes these as expected back to 0 but during the slowdown calling sync when there is zero dirty pages and zero kb in the disk buffer still locks io . what else could sync be doing if there 's nothing to flush out the page cache and write cache ?
i want to use the same share .
i 've updated the question to include the details about the hosts - the guests are linux based ( currently debian ) .
good point . i thought it might be not relevant , but i 've included it anyway .
i 'd like to get all the packages that a `yum groupinstall `` compatibility libraries '' and `` development tools '' ` should do
**edit** why 1000 because the directory contains lakhs of files . so size of file matters .
`dpkg -l` shows that `systemd` is indeed installed but it seems not to be using it . for what i can see here :
they 're all windows machines
i used the brctl show to see bridges then used brctl delbr to remove them . i still have numerous virtual interfaces such as veth1 , veth2 , veth3 , vif0.0 , vif0.1 , vif0.2 , vif0.3 . is there a way to blow all this stuff away and just start with a blank network config ? i 've also removed the nic from the vmware settings screen and added a new one . but when i reboot the new nic and all the bridge stuff is back .
, indeed , my sensors are slow . i am looking at screen refresh rates of about 1fps . by real time i mean streams as opposed to block data .

tom , unfortunately i am not in front of the machine because it was on my rhcsa exam . i guess this question is a little more hypothetical .
**note** above , when i said that something worked or did not work , what i meant was whether it printed the current line number along with the line of text from the file in **real time** . like on the remote server , everything that i tried would always just hang there doing nothing , even when text that would otherwise have been printed to stdout , had i only been grepping , from `/var/log/foo.log`

i downloaded openssl-1.0.2e from openssl.org and followed the instructions in readme . essentially ./config , make , make test , make install .
alright . well , the handbrake-gtk package from debian multimedia gets -o3 from a script , i think the only way to set it up to compile with -os is to modify the scripts . i was hoping there was a global way to do so . when i tried to rebuild pulseaudio , it accepts my build options , but appends -o2 to the end making it impossible to build it as -os .
yes , it apparently runs `terminal` etc
edit : i tried , as user : ibr suggested , to reboot from tty and it worked.so the problem occurs only in gnome .

thanks . it 's all fixed now . i ca n't work out how to mark this question as `` answered '' , but it is .
, knowing how to detect patterns that are only at the end of a line could be useful in many cases . for example : portability , usage in routers with embedded too-simplistic linux , usage with unxutils for windows ( its `find` command conflicts with the windows one ) and ... learning ; - ) . the question is not about `` listing files in a dir '' ( that is just a custom example ) but rather `` understanding the grep command usage ''

hi rui thanks for your response . if you are referring to automated installs of the os then what i am looking for is to provide an iso which will go through an installation wizard of the basics ( such as hardware , network , password ) and also to run some scripts . i tried kickstart but everything was automated . if preseeding is the way to go for such task then i will follow it . what you suggest is to have my packages on a repository and just install them upon os installation correct ?
. but you only get the user . * namespace dump

i 'm using bash .
, yes is two lines . i do n't think that `netstat` return 2 linest now on this pc . so the condition is ok and if `netstat` return two lines should work ?
you 're right , it 's only when the response header has content type set to `application/octet-stream` . an with the link i had problem with content disposition was also set to `attachment` . still the save dialog says `` you have chosen to open ... which is : pdf document '' , so iceweasel has identified the file as a pdf .
this problem occurs only with my version of opensuse ( 12.1 ) on centos 6.3 and opensuse 11.2 it works fine .

the strange thing is that i have another debian machine with the same version of debian ( recently newly installed ) which runs very well on the said init.d script .

hi ! yes , i forgot to copy them when they appeared in the boot-repair window . do you really need them ? then i will post them soon . for my understanding these commands did , what this paragraph means : `=================== suggested repair the default repair of the boot-repair utility would purge ( in order to sign-grub enable-raid enable-lvm ) and reinstall the grub-efi-amd64-signed of mapper/vg_ucs-rootfs , using the following options : sda2/boot , sda1/boot/efi , additional repair would be performed : unhide-bootmenu-10s`

the nas is a synology specific linux with kernel 2.6.32.12 that is using the dd-wrt ipkg repository , so i guess they are quite similar . the router has some kind of proprietary os . not possible to add software to it . only to configure port forwards and similar . from apple `` nat , dhcp , pppoe , vpn passthrough ( ipsec , pptp , and l2tp ) , dns proxy , snmp , ipv6 ( 6to4 and manual tunnels ) '' . i agree that the question would be more manageable if i broke it down . i just do n't know enough to know where to draw the line between different questions . that requires at least a rough idea about how to solve it .

whenever you play a video from youtube or similar sites , videos do get stored in `/tmp` . if i play a video in firefox , these videos are still found in `/tmp` . but somehow i prefer google chrome . which specific location are you asking me to check in home dir ? i mentioned a path above which i checked but it has n't got the thing i 'm searching for .
thx ok i 'll try
no i do n't want to prevent root access . but , if i run the application as usera i want also that any other application runned from usera can not access the files . i think that something like creating a dummy user for the application would be what i need , but i do n't have root access .

this is the output :
i fixed it .
nfs on a ntfs formatted filesystem - could the problem be the locale settings ? currently en_us.utf-8 . updated question
i wanted to prevent the possiblity of brute force attack .
- i do n't know . how would that work ?
[ here ] ( the init script for hwclock .
@ ryanbabchishin i 'm allowed to copy in the local directory , it 's my home dir . also does n't work with `/tmp`
i was able to connect to it locally ! the netstat -na | grep list | grep 69 is wrong because there is no listening text in the netstat output for the tftp server . i ran sudo netstat -pa | grep xinet and saw the server on port 69. as for why windows could n't see it , i turned off the windows firewall and it worked , so the damned windows firewall was secretly blocking it !
no , i cant find any file with a `~` at the end .
im trying to use cal command in script to validate date and this is what my conditions are
i would like to be able to change some options ( especially the lock ) without opening the gui . to call it from a script .
the default on fedora 23 , i think it 's gnome
yes ..it runs without entering a password
awk nf is to omit blank lines in the output .
additional info : ssh -q -i private_key root @ 192.168.0.11 `` command '' the server is a suse linux . i run the ssh command in a loop for 10 times and only 1 or 2 of the tries result in the go away message .
- the symptom is that x applications fail to launch with no feedback , so if i happen to have a `konsole` window open , i try to launch an app form there . that 's when i get the error . btw , feel free to post your original comment as an answer , i think it got me far enough to nail the culprit ( the slack app )
we do not use munmap since glibc malloc and free has the implementations . yes shared libraries are used . why does that matter ? the relevant parts of valgrind report is added to the main question .
i had originally wanted to do that , but i need to be able to use it with programs that only accept files as arguments : (
it depends on a number of sound libraries and maybe other things . i 'm not sure . i think i could build it statically with `./configure -- disable-shared` on the first computer , but it is already installed there and i do n't want to change that installation . i 'll leave it using shared libs there . so i guess the best bet is to make a deb package . is that easy ?
i thought i had answered my own question . like i said , i was sent a patch by coreutils which i applied and it fixed the problem . i thought i had said that ; ) there is no `` official patch '' and they have n't said anything about if/when there will be one . i have n't posted the patch as it was given to me as `` tentative '' . as soon as i hear more i will update it here .
: setting nodatacow also disables checksums : ... `` this also turns off checksumming ! iow , nodatacow implies nodatasum. '' ... .. nodatasum says : `` means bit flips and bit rot might go undetected . ''
`` rfh '' is the first few characters of the line containing the search string . i mean it is the expected result
i do n't remember if i ever found a fix or not . this was a long time ago . i was just experimenting with the feature , and it worked -- regardless of how ugly the login screen was .

ls -a only gives file name . even though in red . using fedora 20 .
`/var/run/lirc` is `root` with `0755` and `lircd.pid lircm lircd` files inside them are `root` with `0644` permission . the folder is no longer there after a reboot .
if it was my application , or if i had access to the source , that would be an option . currently however , it is not . : )
because there are more than 800 files which , i guess ! , i need to specify in `.spec` files ` % files` field .
i do n't believe it to be an x-y problem , however i agree it is a bit odd . i was looking for a way to update the ps1 from a script which changes after every command entered , and needed a mechanism to do so .
i 'm on os x so ca n't use readlink 's -f flag . but `greadlink -f /bin/sh` is saying /bin/sh
my question was answered . but i decided to explain it a little bit . i supposed that `core.` is generated in some hidden file f.e . `.code.~` first and only after generation finished just moved ( renamed ) to target path . in that case operation can be fast and atomic .
suppose there are 1000 entries..user will probably click just one of the entry . so reading 1000 inodes from hard disk to determine whether its a file or directory seems too inefficient .
yes i format it prior to flashing . the program i used includes the feature to format it . the problem is the kali . because the boot of ubuntu linux works perfectly
yes , but not able to get the desired information
i believe it is copying using samba because the terastation is only offering that as protocol ? i may be wrong .
number of lines and columns will be same . but i want selected column from each file to be joined
i know that the files are not linked because : 1. i can change the content of the source and the snapshots are kept unchanged ( tested ) 2. i can delete the source and the snapshots are their to restore ( tested ) 3. the files are stored on the university computation cluster . if something like that was true , somebody would have been fired already ( or at least shouted at ) . nevertheless , the `` inode `` number of the files is the same
on tmpfs . my `filefrag` does n't have `-e` option .
no , not necessarily . a client running under the same process is performing all these connections . i want to drop them once new connections to d and e are established .
sadly not : / like mentioned here : i got severe problems with getting any output at all on that client machine : /
edit : here is the output of doing `nohup sudo strace sudo chromium -user-data-dir=/tmp` : for comparison ( running this actually ends up with chromium opening and functioning normally . )
# # # update # 1 to clarify ; the external screen is used as primary and not secondary . but yes i can access bios and bootable disks . seems like i am ready to procced !
: just updated the op with that info . @ sparhawk : i did n't know about `pkill` . the command i use ( and the command that shows up in `ps aux` ) is `` , would i need to just `pkill` `` or the full string ? also , how would i accomplish it via cron ?
sure : i naively googled and got there :
it always returns 0 , even if the file was n't copied . at least on my system it does .
ok , done , thanks
did not try it with cut , but it does not work with awk , because it divides the columns based on the row , so for example in row that has permission denied , i am just going to get the 'denied ' part as an output
emacs is executing in its own windows . i think the .emacs is fine , do you know where else i could look for the problem ?
: several things . with `` only '' 20 lxc guests the i/o overhead is already tremendous . the linux kernel is fairly good at caching file system requests . so if i can share stuff at the file system level this should be far superior to the `apt-cacher-ng` . i 'd still not want to share between host and guests for other reasons , so the `apt-cacher-ng` instance would be kept for that reason alone . and i believe the point of `apt-cacher-ng` is to download stuff once for many machines . but i want to save on actual disk i/o .
: mostly because it 's homegrown , requires changing code to modify , does n't readily show pretty graphs , etc . this can be added , but why reinvent the wheel ? i 'm pretty sure i 'm not the first person with a need like this , but i failed to find a simple-to-deploy basic monitoring solution . this seems improbable ; i ought to have a blind spot in my google-fu .
to be usable . [ 1 ] :
yes i does support -o
i do have root access to my vps , but i do n't want to litter the root account with rbenv , ruby interpreters and gems . and i want the non-privileged thin account to be able to restart the daemons . if i use init.d , it seems the thin account needs to be a sudoer to have its way .
yes , because it is unix .
i 'd prefer it to be per-user . if i add a sticky bit then *every* user can create special files , which is n't very secure either .
now everything is working fine except from windows 8.1 shutdown ! any ideas ?
the order is ( special number lower upper lower upperlower upper ) every time . how to mix this up ?
__edit__ : firefox and thunderbird have now mysteriously started working ; sage , however , remains inoperable . having downloaded it from the first link on [ this page ] ( ) , extracted it to my desktop ( where firefox and thunderbird run just fine ) , opened the folder in the terminal and run the command `` sage '' ( as there is an executable by that name in the folder ) i receive the error : `bash : sage : command not found` . yet `ls -l` shows that the files are known to exist and be executable .
: i installed gparted in lubuntu 15.10. i am using the lxde desktop , not lubuntu . my question was already answered , though , but thanks !

there any many entry in input file , i just want to remove some container means from `define { ` to ` } ` if that address match , it should not remove any other content , that 's it
slm i have busybox installed and it is included , but if i do a system call from a program `mktemp` will not work .
ps -f returns uid pid ppid c stime tty time cmd cg 7 1 0 01:04 pts/0 00:00:00 sh cg 16 7 0 01:04 pts/0 00:00:00 /bin/bash cg 18 16 0 01:18 pts/0 00:00:00 ps -f so does that mean that bash shell is running as process for sh shell ?
in this case , i want to be able to login using my admin user by entering the un manually , but not show that that user exists to the general public . this is in preparation for ldap based logins . the id that is 999 is the local admin .
yes , /etc/hosts should work as long as the pandora server does n't change ...
it is `ext4` . it says filesystem `/dev/root` is mounted on `/`
i am not the sysadmin . ok , i will ask him . thanks .
i am trying to automate this . script should stop the import if the key does not have encryption capability . if i import temporarily , i can only list the key and manually grep for usage : but that seems rather ugly . maybe if the key listing after import ( gpg -- list-key ) produces script readable output that could also work , but i am not aware how this can be done either .
. meaning i would be able to type `echo $ variable1` and get `value1` as the output , etc
there are no entries for oracle in var/log/cron and i do n't see anything in var/log/secure that would indicate a problem .
i want to stop using the rhel 5 and move to rhel 7. but because i ca n't touch the software in the old rhel , then i should go for vm or docker and i prefer docker as it 's lightweight . also i ca n't reinstall the software as i do n't have the installation media .
restarting the container takes a few seconds longer ( which is not good for developer productivity ) . also , needing to reattach to stdin etc increases the complexity .
debian with lightdm . however i realized that fn-f [ n ] maps to f [ n ] , so problem solved !
thanks for your comment @ archemar , no i want to change the extension and conserve the file name .
its my device you can see output of lsscsi but i ca n't do read and write operation through scsi changer .
quoting the directory name completely solved my problem . thanks so much .
i am trying to back up the whole /home directory . files/directories that are failing are ones such as `/home/a/c/account/users/mail : username` which have permissions like `drwx -- -- -- ` and owned by `mail:4096` . i assume that because user `backups` is in the group `sudo` or `admin` it does n't have access because there are no access permissions for groups ? i dunno , but its erroring on folders/files like that .
no it does not change anything barun , it does not change anything ...
, good point i actually realised % f was not required . jodka lemon 's solution worked both with and without it .
i just want to know how i can use backticks for the command instead of ( )
i dont know that too
`cmp /dev/sdb image` says `cmp : eof on image` .
update : ======== to make the situation more illustrative , here is the script that i am using : cryptsetup -- key-file /dev/urandom create tmp /dev/sda2 mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/tmp > /dev/null 2 > & 1 this script is run during the boot sequence , after `checkroot` . then , later when `bootall` wants to mount `/tmp` , it sees the entry in fstab and mounts `/dev/mapper/tmp` as `/tmp` . since i am creating the `luks` device during every boot , i have to format the partition every time as well . contrary to what some people have commented here , the permissions **do not** survive the formatting . obviously .
no . it has the same problem .
i 'm on csh .
added further details above .
the ipv6 addresses i see are scope : global , and scope : link .
same thing -- i actually have `emacs-nox` installed , so there is no xemacs/window forwarding issues .
edit : the programming is in c++ for an operating systems class . we 're working with system calls and whatnot . it 's using tcsh , g++ ... other than that i 'm not sure what else you 'd need to know ? this is my first unix/linux class .
note 1 : # @ terdon # i updated bash using default software update programme of mint which was showing level 3 category of this update . when i try to boot mint it loops to reboot on selecting regular mint option and recovery mode option . note 2 : # @ gilles # i updated only bash .
he no longer has the ability to ssh in , so that is taken care of , but good suggestion . i was just hoping to clean up his account quickly for now , perhaps i will have to sift through everything to get rid of his user , though . thanks !
` $ ls -l chroot12/usr/bin/python -rwxrwxrwx 1 admin admin 2884984 oct 30 19:05 chroot12/usr/bin/python`
no , i do n't have another day to spend doing that . ... other than having software i do n't need on the box , does it matter ?
, at some point there is simply this debate going on about how one should behave , constantly downloading it to install it does not make sense if downloading slows things down , and it is also a form of a query into another location , which means there will be observers , and it also is waste of `` resources '' and `` time '' . so if something can be installed from a usb 400 times in the next 5 years , that 's 400 times a-lot of things .
the mba has only one micro-dvi port , which is then linked to the hdmi port of tv via the chain i wrote above , so i guess the answer is hdmi1
at least use it
it is not about specific dependencies . it is about general aptitude resolver behaviour . it always wants to remove instead of upgrading .
you are right , input and output of command2 and command3 are too large to be kept in memory . i was expecting using swap would work better than using temporary files . another problem i have is that this happens in a loop , and that makes handling files even harder . i 'm using a single file but at this moment for some reason there is some overlap in reading and writing from the file that causes it to grow ad infinitum . i 'm going to try to update the question without boring you with too many details .
ok. right . i didnt do anything inside filtro.php because i wanted to see if this filter would work , but what i want to do is add something like [ artz @ mydomain.com ] before the subject text and add a text at the end of the content message saying `` this message was sent to artz @ mydomain.com . ''
. **edit : **the script runs a rsync into a directory with git . if the directory is clean then i want to exit . if the directory is not clean then i would like to execute some more commands
well i just typed : aptitude install default-jre : i386
i 'm using mint os 16
see my previous comment - yes , it is , and i suspect that this is excatly the problem .
so it will start like ssh server1 `` ssh server2 `` the rest is as above '' note the i need to run above code from php .
that would be reasonable ( and in line with wingedsubmariner 's suggestion ) , but the team will be doing ad-hoc editing of the files by command line or other ssh-connected editing apps .
well i think it does n't depend on my hardware , because it only happens with linux ! so at least it can be a driver problem
i ran ./shutdown +30 . i get `` shutdown : need to be root '' . however , if the permissions say that anyone can execute , why do i need to be root ?
well , nothing particular . the site i got this from did n't mention anything . what is one supposed to do ?
, you mean to run `-depth 1` , `-depth 2` etc . until `find` finds nothing ?
msfl @ chanakyauat : ~ $ vnc4server the program 'vnc4server ' is currently not installed . you can install it by typing : sudo apt-get install vnc4server
**update 2 : ** after trying the suggestion from dmitry vasilyanov i found that if i insert the -i it will simulate as user login . however this is not the final way to do it . if i run `echo $ path` after logging in as openproject the ouput is `/usr/local/bin : /usr/bin : /bin : /usr/local/games : /usr/games : /home/openproject/.rvm/bin` if i run `echo $ path` after `su openproject -c `` bash -l '' ` the output is `/home/openproject/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/bin : /home/openproject/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0 @ global/bin : /home/openproject/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/bin : /usr/local/bin : /usr/bin : /bin : /usr/local/games : /usr/games : /home/openproject/.rvm/bin`
what 's the full command for that ?
well the problem with dstat is the same as vmstat or other one-liners : there 's a limited amount of data you can shove in there . in systat , you can show *all* interrupts , individually , at once . in dstat to do that , you 'd have a really really wide screen to show all interrupts ...
upd : also , it seems that with some login themes i ca n't log into this user . some of the themes check the username against a list somewhere and others do n't , i guess .
not a duplicate of . i understand that i ca n't decrypt the files , however , i can list them in the terminal so i am looking for a way to list which ones are encrypted and which ones are not .
additional info : the characters are also filtered when pasting text into a terminal emulator ; for a moment , i was able to get `a` to paste as part of a string when it was at the front , but i 'm no longer able to .
nope ip should be obtained from a system utility like nslookup or ping..
the log file is too large . is there any particular part i should look for or post ?
no , you can use any tool . there 's no restriction .

teacher is n't joking . he said that it 's very easy . i do n't know , may be he means to use not only `mv` command
have just added another screenshot
yes it 's a typo , fixed .
ok i did as you tolde me , i did a **whereis nmcli** , i found out it is located in **/usr/bin/nmcli** , hence my new script is : /usr/bin/nmcli connection up myvpn . again it works when it is manually launched , but it does n't when i put in crontab
yes ! thank you ! i really should have tried that based on what i just said eh ?
the date is at the begining of the line . somewhere there are only not full date ( hh : mm : ss ) . i 've updated the question body . please see the example .
grub2 . are there large differences between different versions within grub2 ?
ohai & facter they both show ubuntu only
: can you tell me what does 2,2n and 3,3n means basically why n and 2,2 and 3,3 ? ?
using `chmod 777` made it work , i feel dumb for not thinking of that . i guess it makes sense , though , since i formatted it with root and all . post it as an answer so i can accept it !
no , no reply , and i have not worked out any solution myself .
yes . there are loads of other ips .
update : it 's slightly worse than i feared : nautilus seems to be employing only tracker to perform searches and tracker is being a couch potato . i ran `tracker-control -s` and it reported that all the miners were idle .
it is booting with the correct drivers , and both card are detected but i only get output from the gtx970

i will give a look !
i would i 'm just terrified i would ruin the progress that i have already made . does grep change files ? i ca n't remember .
yes , i have full permissions , i 'm using root .
yes `` /home/internal/evol/sskadam '' is the place where iam building gcc ... .and thanks for properly formatting my question
what i am really interessed about , is to combine a lot of physical machines into one big machine ( or vm ) , the solution should be free and linux based..
first case : i send mail to another user using my terminal , they did n't receive any mail they checked using mail command in their system . but second time i opened another user 's terminal in my terminal using su command and then i send mail to another user whose terminal is opened in my terminal using my terminal , after that i checked mail in another user terminal using mail command .mail which i sent to another user was there .
yes , `parallel-ssh` and `pssh` are indeed the same .
well . it 's the default in ubuntu 12.04.03 .
: i have updated the question with the scp output . it is not even making correct scp output .
create an answer ! : d
nope , i 'm not using oh-my-zsh . i think i should have just focused on one thing in my question instead of addressing what i 'm going for overall . in bash , if there are no potential completions , nothing happens , but in zsh , a tab character is inserted . i just want to disable zsh 's tab character insert when there are no completions .
same error message of unexpected eof ... guess it is corrupted , dont know why i didnt think of that : / is there a way to repair the file or just remove the corrupted block ? i 'll research as well ...
and this is my smb.conf file :
sorry , it is in bash .
+1 by whether or not source-highlight can colorize that file type .
the delimiter is tab.yes , the contents are same .
ok , after `sudo cryptsetup luksopen` two new targets appear for `sudo dmsetup targets` : `error` and `crypt` . i guess i need to change the question then ...

well for this example i am specifying where the index.html file will be found on a nginx web server .
got it .
updated to respond
hi @ fiximan - could you expand on the parent-child relation ?
how could i know ? as far as i was able to figure out with `reiserfsck` all seems ok - as long as i do n't change any defaults
this bash script will be stored on my machine locally , it will then iterate through a list of hostnames ( $ i ) , connect to each hostname , query that hostname for its memory/cpu allocated . and then write that data to a file on my machine ( $ dest ) , one per line on the $ dest file .
i just tried it and it does work in the virtual terminal . any suggestions ?
: yes , i was using it , i do n't know if its size grew
asking for possible causes and possible solutions .
. well i would say less dependencies to a specific desktop . if its ever again the case that i have to switch the dektop environment ( omg gnome ) , i dont want to learn new apps . the editor should not really fit for awesome . it should fit for me and be independant of des . i will give vim a try .
see updated question for responses .
right - tomcat 7.0.22 , edited the question to show this .
i have posted the dmesg above ( a small portion of the same thing repeating over and over again ) .
no , there are no mount points on that filesystem . i verified this with the mount command just now .
i 'm sorry but what do you mean by `` distro '' ?
i also want to be able to store the error messages from tar in a log .

: i 'm working on a lab cluster and i do n't have sysadmin authority . r-2.15.0 is installed but one package i need requires r-2.15.3 . hence the $ home/software .
the thing that is forking is a command that is part of my shell prompt .
this is in a setup that is becoming more common ( i think ! ) where one uses grub to unlock the luks partition containing the kernel and initrd . this guide explains some of the idea behind it and a basic way to implement it :
no , it does not .
no that was on purpose ... basically i wanted to make the route identical on both sides for testing
i 've builded it manually .
yes all directories are 755 and files are 644 .
i know i know @ 1_cr , i just really want to know how to do it with grep , curiosity..
i have also used dd to test write speed of the disk with the following results : time sh -c `` dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=512 count=2048k '' 2097152+0 records in 2097152+0 records out real 0m3.250s user 0m0.627s sys 0m2.622s
i 've added smb.conf
they 're not already set unfortunately . also , since this is an isolated namespace , i do n't actually want to inherit my user 's environment . i 'm just looking for a more convenient way to establish the environment when entering the namespace .
just the top level dirs only , depth = 1. i have updated the question to show desired output

problem solved , though in a peculiar way . i put the ip address from traceroute directly in browser & the server opened its file directory & that 's good enough for me .
the remaining spaces should be `` * '' ...
i do not know how to improve . i 'm sorry .

, a couple example usages of the word anti-pattern that you 're likely to understand : `curl -s| sudo bash` is very much an anti-pattern though i have even seen it in software install instructions . in `vi` , staying in insert mode all the time and using arrow keys to navigate is an anti-pattern . and , this famous question is on the subject of a very common `bash` anti-pattern :
yes , i tried pip freeze and i got pyopenssl==0.15.1
yes , what i posted is a string . my tests just worked first with it , so i posted anyway . but surely , a list is more appropriate for this . thanks for your snippet .

i installed proprietary nvidia driver but that does n't make a difference .
maybe , maybe later so i will be specific in the first place .
it says invalid options ( on os x yosemite ) . if there is , you would do `du -sh * | sort -gh` ?
then the group information is invalid too . the same holds true for `` `/bin/dash -l `` `
i tried using it also , its showing `headphones` but sound still comes through speaker only .
wow that was pretty stupid of me . i do have single quotes at the beginning and end , and double quotes within the proxycommand= '' '' variable .
adding oddjob mkhomedir creates the home dir and puts the user in the directory .
you do n't call this `` bridge '' ?
i understand that i would have to compile sources of these tools , in order to get them to use in the current session , something i have had 0 hours of experience with . so , on [ gilles ] ( [ advice ] ( thought i would ask the above , first , just in case .
i added some examples , does that make it more clear ? as for the anchors , no , i guess they are not necessary ...
nope , i 've started a list of at least 10 different variations , all with no success .

the short version is the old vm host that had crashed was not powered down and somehow started working again . so sporadically traffic was going to the old server which was when we saw the issues .
it 's using an ssd . the pc is only a month or two old . also worth noting is that there are actually three of these pcs and they 're all exhibiting the same issue ( often around the same time ) . i guess moreso than finding root cause , i 'm looking for any ideas on what could potentially cause the gui , mouse/keyboard , and networking to all fail , yet not be a kernel panic .
unfortunately i do n't have sssd and i ca n't replace software in current solution . there is fully enough to have cache only for users who 's connected at least once
: please find the additional details above .
it 's adress of directory
yes i need a graphical environment ! i will be using a graphical program , wireshark . i know that slax linux is only 130 mb . it is using kde . but i ca n't seem to get it installed on the cf card . the installation file is .zip format . i do n't know what to do , do i just use the unzip command and it will run or what ?
debian proper - as shared am on unstable/sid , testing and some packages from experimental ( pretty much a mixed system . )
i provided the sample output as well .
i 'm entering the password everytime ( and i 'm ok with that for now ) . as for ` & ` i tried that once but what happened was that firefox opened before i had a chance to type my password ... i do n't think that is a huge deal but i would prefer if firefox only launched if the ssh connection was successful .
. my question is largely hypothetical , but i can think in something like a system with centralized configuration in sqlite database and `/etc/` full of these scripts querying such database when a daemon ( or another program ) opens them for reading . i 've discarded cron because i want the files contents being generated just before they are opened , and i do n't want a daemon regenerating these files from time to time . i do n't know if applicable , but i discarded inotify too because i consider it very linux-specific .
no , it 's a uid in the 6800s . i did this , though : `killall -u ap_6857 -l -i` , and got , `hup int quit ill trap abrt iot bus fpe kill usr1 segv usr2 pipe alrm term stkflt chld cont stop tstp ttin ttou urg xcpu xfsz vtalrm prof winch io pwr sys unused `
-- edit : solved . the problem was with selinux , i clearly put it in permissive mode , but i never rebooted to changes apply properly . so i checked selinux current state with `sestatus` and i saw it configured in permissive mode , but running in enforcing mode .
as part of my startx command i run a script to change the screen layout , but that 's easy enough to fix . the more serious problem for me is that i3 uses the screen name in it 's configuration files . ( so that i can make sure certain desktops and windows go to certain screens )
: we need to automate the transfer , this is one among several files that we fetch , the rest of which are already automated [ none of the rest require two-factor authentication ] .
`time` it was just an example . if you type `help` in your terminal using bash you can find out that `a star ( * ) next to a name means that the command is disabled` . that 's what i want to accomplish .
i have no problem creating files or folders . i have only problem with ghost/corrupted file in 2-3 subfolders in the cachhe folder .
if any other process is using it ..deleting it creates .nfs files .
yes . automount and permanent both checked
yep - parent directory is all set correctly .

`` no keyboard input , no mouse movement ? '' - yes . it 's the same as frozen x. or switch to console and block him there .
that do that
fix this or
- short answer , no . long answer , you can get pretty far with `ps -p 1 -o command` ( prints the path to the current `init` ) . on arch linux and fedora ( iirc ) , it 's a symlink to the `systemd` binary ( probably same on all `systemd` systems ) . on `upstart` , `init -- help` will print usage information , and on my box , `upstart` is mentioned where it says who to email . on freebsd ( sysv ) , this will return an error . there may be similar clues on other systems , but since asking this question , i 've decided to just create them for all platforms and make separate packages for each one .
that was not a negative sign , its a hyphen !
please see the 4th edit ,
for asm database luns should be formatted . so before executing dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdiskx we usually do lquerypv . i was wondering if the equivalent command is available in linux
`echo $ 0` is not an option here , as the script will run on many different machines where first thing i 'll need to check is the shell .
pressing `'` twice does n't do anything either . the keyboard layout is `us` model `pc105` with options `bksp : bksp_escape , compose : rctrl , caps : backspace` . the window manager is i3 .
is there any other way i can send alert to all offline node ?
ok , i have posted the contents of my sources.list file , but what am i supposed to retrieve for `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list` ? any why is the wildcard ( * ) included ?
it 's an asus x75a-ds51
**upd** : i 'm using ubuntu 14.04
no , it does n't help . log out/in neither . i suppose it 's my syntax .
`date + ' % m ' -d 'last month' `date + ' % y ' -d 'last year '
you type something short , and the auto-complete program listens to what you typed ; if it matches something in it 's list , it will type a large string of text for you . that 's how a simple auto-complete program works ... but phrase express takes it further , allowing you to add a scripting language that will move the cursor around , copy and paste the clipboard , press key combinations etc ... it 's very powerful , and alot faster than typing everything yourself . you can reach wpm of over 300 if you do it right .
if i use `` -march=amdfam10 '' , guy with a old core2 without sse4 wo n't be able to run my build without fatal errors .
yep that prints `backup.tgz` , should i be calling the tar command to look in the $ destin folder ? ( ie tar xvpfz $ destin $ backup -c / )
, `ifconfig -a` yields just the same output . i have edited the original question to reflect .
the only program that appears to be using ~/mail is sylpheed .

i have n't back up it for 2 years . i forgot for this and how many configurations i have made in it : - (
: i had them installed . i 've also tried to update jdk to 1.7 , but it did n't work .
**edit : ** what i mean is i 'd like to run commands that are aliased inside of the directory ~ $ foo -bash : foo : command not found ~/project $ foo bar !
yes , that 's right
it might be kind of odd ; ) what i am trying to do , is to lookup in my database , if the destination ip of the lookup is in a certain foreign country , and if it is , i want to set up a route on my server , that also acts as a router , to a specific isp , or in some cases a vpn connection . i have tried to set up a lot of routes , 99 % will never be used , and the performance is very bad . if i can do it on demand , the dns performance will be bad , but in my case , this does not have any influence .
, actually both . but the data is more important . if i could get my data back , i will still format that disk to ext4 and put the data back .
unfortunately , `ctermbg` does n't seem to have `reverse` option - `.vimrc` highlights it as bad , and it does n't seem to do anything .
mitha : that 's it ! i just have to find out about my bootloader now ( well .. i never saw it ) . thanks !
they are about 80 % fixed strings and a rest are patterns . the list does not change so often . i do not really understand this suggestion : `` write a code generator to accept the pattern list and output an awk script with the patterns hard-coded '' can you explain the suggestion in more detail ?
output for `uname -rs` is `aix 2` .
# # # updates i have also tried the following , with no luck : - i tried compiling with and without `config_vfp` enabled - i added `config_devtmpfs` and `config_devtmpfs_mount` - applying [ this patch ] ( ) and enabling `cpu_v6` , `config_mmc_bcm2835` , & `config_mmc_bcm2835_dma` - using the [ `gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian` toolchain ] ( )

, @ tnw , then the remaining issue is multiple processes from `xargs` instead of one ...
well i already tried that ... check out update as well
i do n't have any mapping at all with `~` , and i 'm not using it via ssh .
creating a debian package would certainly be the best approach . i 'm not familiar with the tool , though . for me , it would be good enough to give it a shot to see if a converted package works . if not , i would just install my little helper library by hand . the only advantage of having a deb package would be that i can uninstall easier if i no longer it .
`/bin/sh - > busybox ` . busybox , apparently . good catch .
i want to try and do it all in one go because that was just the example . i have 12 words i 'm looking for in 23 different folders , so 23 * 12 scripts will be annoying to run and i 'm lazy
... thanx ... this works , but suppose i need `` me '' to be resolved from a variable , say $ region , how this should be applied with above ?
rsyslogd is running , i 've not changed anything in sshd_config , but it may have been changed after installation . certainly the pam files have been modified .
i need to create a home directory , but its parent may be managed by automounter .
i 'm ca n't rememeber all messages . but nothing strange . how to log messages after reboot ? /var/log/messages nothing shows . yes i 'm using reboot command
i used the drives from the link provided from the original post on askubuntu . i do n't know if they are xp drivers or something else . i did however follow through on all the directions on that original post and i believe it still is not working . i 'm trying to remember the command to see the info for the devices . i am so sorry everyone . i 'm really green . been on linux for about 3 hours . : - )

the code points have changed in this version of powerline ! this means that you either have to patch your font again , or change the glyphs powerline uses in your user configuration .
vim version is **vim - vi improved 7.4 ( 2013 aug 10 , compiled jan 2 2014 19:39:32 ) ** , i think the ` : help starstar-wildcard` is relative to the internal commands ( correct me if i am wrong ) as the `**` was already working with ` : vimgrep`
, i tried to provide a bit more detail , but i 'm generally afraid of exposing sensitive information . could you tell me what you 're looking for specifically ? also hopefully my update provided a bigger clue anyway than the original `ls -l` i was looking at might have . for the windows- > centos transfer i thought rsync was n't able to transfer permissions info ( coming from ntfs ) . then from centos to the backup i do n't understand why it would be trying that nor who these two other users are .
lsattr : permission denied while reading flags on abc
: i 've tried that now , it shows : ` [ root @ octopus ~ ] # file -s /dev/mmcblk0p3 /dev/mmcblk0p3 : data [ root @ octopus ~ ] # `
yes , that works perfectly ! thanks : ) can you post this as an answer ? also , how can i get the number right before the first underscore ?
centos server . i do n't have a console for it . for now it 's just a cage of steel and silicon sitting in a corner . @ sobrique tried your method and it works ! feel free to post as an answer so i can accept it : )
not really , just need specific applications up and running .
the tool must modify environment variables in the calling / source / parent shell , which can only be done by calling ` . script.sh` . therefore , the wrapper script can not be a python script .
i actually tried to fix the mbr using a windows recovery disk and this time all the grub 2 disappeared . i think somehow i installed grub alongside windows bootloader now there are fedora 20 and ubuntu 14.04.1 lts on my computer already installed but there is no grub . what can i do ?
the best soluction is `` $ { a % ? ? } '' because it works in bash in and ksh
i do n't know what 's inside it at extraction time . this should n't depend on what 's inside the archive either . if it 's a folder , extract the folder in there . if it 's a file , extract all files .
any idea how to fix that ?
lets say i want to ban all access to yahoo or facebook ; i want to do it without hunting for their ips and blocking them . i do n't want facebook in anyway to be able to get through my firewall on all protocols .

thanks for the sound advice . it really helps .
no , he was not being ironic . also , he *is* totally an avid/rabid apple fanboy . but i really do n't see how that 's helping this thread .
either way really . whatever is quickest just to get this thing working !
i 'm using oracle linux 7.1. basically rhel
yes , merge all .txt file into one directory .
, because i somehow read over those options ... i suggest that you post your comment as answer . after a first try i 've noticed that server response lines only have `` \n '' instead of `` \r\n '' and client ones have `` \\r\n '' . but still very useful . just , problematic - i assume - when you are suspecting a server messing up line endings - then you do n't see it via `socat -v`/`-x` .

if the accelerometer is -300 or higher ( like 100 ) make the screen rotate the normal.if it is smaller than -700 ( like -900 ) rotate the screen left.as you can see in the code i have already done it for the non negative number and it works ( rotating the laptop turns the screen like on a phone but only only one way since i have not finished the negative code )
yes , i confirmed that test is n't in the magic group . however , root , messagebus , and gabe are in the magic group .
how to start doing this as an automated/loop process rather than checking each day .zip file manually @ michaelvehrs
that works fine , asking for password and outputted this :
i run ubuntu server , and ran command `mv stuff new1` @ anthon
added some information about scripting languages . the web server has php , but i can not use it from the web .
, yes it does . it has 2 partitions : a small boot partition and a larger main partition where the majority of the os sits . i am just trying to expand the 2nd partition to fill the card .
why is the `db5.1-util` package kept back ? in my opinion i even do n't need this package because it satisfies dependencies for packages which i do n't have installed : root @ server : ~ #
x-copy deployment is an installation method simply by copying files . as opposed to more cumbersome methods , e.g . on windows once files are copied some of the needs to be registered in a registry , etc , which prohibits moving the installed software from one file location to another and usually adds unnecessary layer of complexity .
no i mean cod of any unix version that linux might use

its a txt table
: that 's precisely what i 'm investigating ; ) . for some people it seems to be a mandatory basis for a secure system , for other something useless , and some consider it to be even something negative . sadly nobody seems to have a concrete [ answer on security se ] ( so i finally had to answer myself with a yet-to-complete answer since i found at least interesting differences in the openbsd and freebsd approaches , and was therefore curious of the mentioned linux version of random pids ( if there is really one ) .

i do n't think so . i did `sudo make modules_install install` . after that in the /boot directory there were 3 new files . initrd.img-4.5.0-rc1 , vmlinuz-4.5.0-rc1 and system.maph4.5.0-rc1

yes . is there a problem with it ?
yes , it should be utf-8 all around . the website i 'm talking about is www.skoroprazdnik.ru . the question is not 100 % linux-specific , but it 's a nginx webserver running on linux .
if i run `pacmd` and `list-sinks` , i was getting , name as `auto_null` and state as `suspended ' . so i thought there is some problem with pulseaudio and hence i tried to install from source
i completely understand your question and i apologize for including something that may seem a bit off topic considering the title . i 'm new to the server side of things and i 'm following a tutorial where the instructor created an ubuntu instance using an aws ec2 instance using the above listed configurations and since i 'd prefer to use a linux box , i wanted to figure out how i could configure my linux ec2 instance with the same ( or similar ) setup that they configured their ubuntu instance .
i have gnome 3. i edited the main question .
csh is the shell taht i am using .
it 's 1
i want the environment to be like a fresh shell ( running .rc files ) would be , ignoring any changes i had made to the environment . for other reasons , storing and restoring and un-restoring the env is messy .

there was a lot of information from last two hours , so i decided to remove this file to have it clean . but the log information is not written in there now . there seem to be problems with `dhcp` .
yes , i do and i could do it . it would be fairly easy if i would use for instance dropbox for it . but it looks like a hack for a problem which seems to be quite common . it also remains the problem to make ssh aware of the ip ( if want to realize simple logins using the config file ) .
the content is equal to the output i posted before devices : hci0 xx : xx : xx : xx : xx : xx

printmotd yes/no does n't affect the behavior on debian . configs are n't changed btw
hi which temp you were referring..any specific location i need to look at ?
i tested xgamma : it only affects the external monitor when using -d :0 . -d :1 does not work . also if i try the darkest setting ( -gamma 0.1 ) text written in white is not dimmed . good guess , though . xorg indicates it is a radeon card .

, neither . it is interpreted as a path in the current working directory . `visudo : specified editor ( ./vi ) does n't exist` . i 'll correct my question to say command rather than relative path . @ eyoung100 , i 'm not just asking about how to configure visudo to change the editor , i 'd like to know why it behaves the way it does . what 's the right way to phrase that question ?
no , nothing at all is written to the logs when i run the scan .

nope , it 's definitely disabled / not even supported .

can i somehow check if the disk was unplugged before unmounting ? this is a home pc , family members have access to it.. at least then i know what the cause could be . no harm done , i still have all files .
no ... dmesg shows nothing . i tested other devices which of course work fine and do produce output on dmesg and lsusb ...
no there is n't . i just followed the example from the url .
a normal computer
i have two instances of jboss running on the same server with two different ports . ( 8280 & 10580 ) . i am facing issue while downloading a file using `wget` on port 8280 , but the file is getting downloaded on the other port .
i think i did , but to be honest , it 's been a couple years and i do n't really remember well . this was just a little toy that i was working on , and i do n't have the box around any more .
. edit : i did discover that another solution is to use : find . -name `` *.tcl '' | cat `cat /dev/stdin` i do n't understand why i have to cat a filename before cat will see it as a file instead of a string though
: i forgot to mention that all of the commands were run by `root` ( including `fuser` and `lsof` )
yes , my regular user has a password as well .
while the host is not in production , it is the test environment for my production gear , so i try not to mess with it . i would try other alternatives rather than mess with the host ... additionally , the host is debian based ( proxmox ) and therefore i could not try the same installation method
i am using elementaryos ( ubuntu ) and i never used networkmanager . i have read around internet about routing ( with `route` and `ip` ) based on the ips , but as i said ( and i know that maybe i am making it more complicated ) i do not have to always work like this . when i have to connect to that network i plug a different ethernet cable . so ... maybe too complicated ?
because my skills are very limited and this is what i thought to do ...
the .class java files are not text files as far as i know . so , it means that the command `` grep -r supermario . '' will also search inside the .class java files ?
yes , they are in /etc/hosts file only .
i was just wondering if this is possible . thanks anyway : )
**update** slackware 14 does not include `dip` by default , but does have `dip` available for download at . for the time being , i am going to try this route .
i have dis-installed with sudo apt-get remove gnome-tweak-tool . by now there is no bad consequence yet .
i commented the line mentioned in `~/.netrc` file and now when i run `ftp rs` , it asks for username and password . `ravbholua @ ravbholua-aspire-5315 : ~ $ cat .netrc` ` # default login anonymous password ravisingh1 @ rediffmail.com ravbholua @ ravbholua-aspire-5315 : ~ $ ` but still it 's not very clear as how `.netrc` works in ftp . any suggestion please for clarification .
-- -- **edit : ** i should also clarify - this is a stock installation of ubuntu server 12.04 32-bit .
thanks for response . i downloaded it from firefox website .
i 've deleted it from serverfault
wicd was running . can you write it as an answer , so i can close this question ?
the main idea not about recovering the data as you can read above . but yes it is almoust the same question : is it possible to re-create a raidz that has been destroyed ?
no . to make the question a bit clearer i updated it with some use cases .
: i know it 's the same software . i 'm asking about support .
it 's probably a stupid question to experts , but as someone who grew up on only single-user windows machines , having recently migrated to linux , this concept of software being installed in a location other than the local system and still being executable by the local system , is just simply mindblowing .
i edited my question with that outputs .
edited with the command output
: i do n't really feel like i 've gotten the answer though.. my question was intended to be more about how to figure out what 's wrong than about how to fix it . i still have pretty much zero clue how this stuff works , and just happened to stumble on a more specific set of reproduction steps . the most recent comment on the freedesktop issue mentions that there might be some work done towards a bug fix within the next couple of weeks ; if there ends up being a patch or something i guess i 'll post that as an answer .
it should give result like .txt , .log , .csv one for each pattern
this is what it gives : rhel5.5s-x64.repo rhel-debuginfo.repo
i have n't managed to fix it yet . i _did_ , however , discover that if you can find a suitable download site , you can just manually copy the files to `/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions` . it 's hardly `` convenient '' , though .
i use ubuntu 12.04
red hat os 5.5 .
it was not enabled by default and i did n't change it . root login through ssh is disabled . however , i am able to mount the storage to another ec2 instance where root is available .
hi , yes i wil post the content of mdstat this evening because i have not access to the nas at this time . if i remember correctly the status of md5 indicate clean , degraded with a missing disk ( disk not appear anymore ) . on list sdd [ 5 ]
the only one that producing output is `/mnt/chroot/proc : 1927 2357 2380` . that 's right after i chroot inside it and exit immediately
nothing vary there - `stp enabled` ( as some are connected with gre ) , all has `vnet` 's interfaces in it ( which correspond to locally run vm 's )
for instance , if i print from firefox , it pops up a dialog box that 's meant to let me select the printer . there 's normally supposed to be a list of printers in it . the list is empty in this condition . it 's not just in one gui program . i also get an error when i do an lpr from the command line : `` lpr : error - scheduler not responding .

user with uid 1000 is just a usual user in the wheel group . so in theory at least this is just as much safe as it would be to launch it from the user itself ?
i just want to make sure.. is this right or is there better than this ?
hmm.. i get ntfs-3g not found on modprobe . ntfs modules loads , though .
ah , thanks . no underline or color shift on this meant it did n't scan as a link to me .
after reading more about net : ssh2 i decided to use a different library that was more compatible with different archs .
no . i did not find any solutions . `mysql_result : :fetch_all ( ) ` still does n't work on my system .
gvkv : i know nothing about xorg.conf , how should i know what part of it is not proper ? : )
hi i is difficult in awk ? ? i can try do it in perl but i assume it is not that difficult in awk though i am struggling to write an awk statement for it : (
shows the following `sudo $ echo ' $ s ' | sendmail -bt sendmail -bv queszama @ yahoo.in address test mode ( ruleset 3 not automatically invoked ) enter` >
yeah , you 're correct . i ended up not using any of the above , so i never ran into that `exit` . i 'll fix it in the question regardless so it does n't red-herring anyone .
that was just an example , my actual table has a lot more rows so doing it manually is n't feasible . the value in the second column does n't matter .
f - proximity to the modem has no impact .
. port forwarding done . but still ca n't connect
, i thought that upnp standed for `` enable port forwardings '' or something . ok i 'll turn it off . thanks for both comments . and thanks hennes for inserting the pictures in the post : )
i tried =sum ( a $ 3 : a ) or ( a : a ) as another post suggested , it doesnot work . well , now i use the stupidest way to solve this lol =sum ( a3 : a1000000 ) , i am sure the rows wont be over than 1 million ... stupid but easy lol
what i meant by flashing is to repair the usb flash drive by softwaring it again .
flv and mpeg-4 .
trying that file , i get the same `` this is untrusted ; would you like to allow / deny this self-signed code ? '' ( paraphrased ) dialog popping up . i do not get that chance to accept the untrusted code from this real application . as for the guest account - are you suggesting trying the guest account on os x as it has some different behaviour than my regular account ?
yes u r right . i can not ssh to ubuntu but i can to centos
safe mode did n't work .
the link above was useful so i could potentially see new types of governer out there . my problem remains however , according to my kernel config the governer is set to userspace , but by the time the system has booted it 's in ondemand mode . os is debian 7 armhf .

i ( nobody for that matter ) am not writing cuda programs all the times ! i do use it for normal purposes as well - watching tutorials , browsing through websites and stuffs . i do n't write and executing programs for long time ( afterall i 'm learning ) . but even if i have to use it for like an hour in the whole day , it does n't make sense to remove and re-install it again whenever i need it .
, perhaps an error message . or anything instead of showing a broken google **search** page .
thanks for your reply . i really wanted to export the graph , but suspected this would be impossible . i realise i can export the data then `` transform '' it into an excel gantt chart manually , but it seems cumbersome .
- well , not sure ... i feel like it gets very unresponsive after around 60 % . but yea i see your point . will try to manage better
i want to list files at 12h01 . how can i set my crontab to do this ?

windows xp on both ends edit : however , i can make the machine that is running the vnc server a linux one if necessary .
so the question is how to allow postinst script to show gui window during installation in ubuntu software center .
edit : as i have said in a comment all of these answers in the questions you provided as duplicates just say ways of changing the name . my principle question is why this happened . i want a way to change the name only if it is a normal situation and not a problem .
- no solution that i 'm aware of . fortunately i 've already used monitors at most of my clients , so i do n't run into this very often anymore ... but i dread the next time i get a new laptop and have to start all over .

windows 10 professional . it was previously windows 7 professional , but it had the same issue then . i am going to try a bios update , as suggested by wes sayeed .
yes , win7 recovery . is it safe to say y ? if i say no it gives the option to run on restart but unfortunately that does n't happen since the blue screen is shown first .
oh , and i hope not to use vba ! ! : - )
: it is dual boot only
indeed i am referring to http and other stuff . i will deploy a web applicaton . besides , at the moment i can access guest only via vsphere client . guest 's ip 192.168.x.x . therefore there is no way of accessing to it directly ( externally ) .
i can not access the server so to your question no i can not .
i do n't use wireless keyboards or mice . i used to and learned my lesson that not everything should be wireless .
i just ran `winmgmt /verifyrepository` and got the result : `wmi repository is consistent`
really ? im using zsh atm , and when i use bash , the ctrl+a ( go to the first char of line ) and ctrl+e ( go to the end of the line ) works fine . but when i use zsh , it goes like the screenshot . so i think its an problem about zsh , not the os : (
it 's `/usr/bin/sudo`
h & k are the columns that the multiplication happens . that i would like rounded before the summing takes place .

xbox 360 , sorry i only mentioned that in the tags
well any raid scheme that uses xor would in theory be impacted , but for the sake of example ... let 's just assume standard raid-5 configuration , but you may also go with raid-4 if that works .
both raids are local . network traffic not an issue .
update : loading in /safe mode does not help . i ran procmon and see that the process loads and does some stuff , but exits within about .2 seconds . nothing obvious based on the registry and file access to my inexperienced eye ... still a puzzle .
i want to hide the ip from the hosts i interact with via vps .
i meant notebook . sorry , i 'll replace that .
no , it 's not . and also it 's part of a list . i wanted to underline it or at least made it bold , but it did n't let me do it in the code .
it does apparently , here 's the screenshot i think it 's the superuser equivalent in windows 8 .

i did that it worked for a bit then when i restarted the vm other ip was attributed on dhcp server ...
yes i wanted to create the partitions on sda2 . my sda has lower disk space .
sorry , i guess that would be helpful . os is windows 8.1 pro x64 and the program is not publicly available , so knowing what the program is would not be helpful .
built in finder , path finder , disk order.. same result .
moreover the file which is not coming up by cmd- > dir is not also showing in documents- > my videos .
they are numbers as far as i can tell - though they are the results of a text to columns call ; i am going to try with raw data in a new sheet to see if i can reproduce it
on a centos client , i see the same thing , but with the group `nobody` instead of `nogroup` ( likely a syntactical thing ) .
, i published the `/etc/hosts` file of `computer1` in the question . the `/etc/hosts` file of `computer1` only contains lines for `computer1` . same thing for `computer2` .
i saw someone say that volume retails cant get windows 10 , i have 1 of the updates , kb2976978 , can i still get it ? i have n't got win10 icon even after running a script , and rebooting , i tried everything i really could and i guess this is the reason why ? ?
i reconfigured the realtek audio manager to stereo instead of 7.1 audio , and now everything is working . thank you very much .

thanks . i have figured out .
the data represents timesheet entries for a specific task/milestone . so when a week has the same date more than once , that means that there were 2 timesheet entries for that date .

nothing as of now but i 'd like to know what to do in case something happens .
i found the situations when that happens : when the power settings on windows are set to `` balanced '' , or `` power saving '' , then the problem happens . all websites that stream video , such as youtube , video , etc , present that problem . when use the `` high performance '' power settings , the problem disappears . so i guess the performace is reduced to minimum levels with the other power settings ?
i wish to lubricate the shaft it is making horrible noise .
i am currently trying windows 7. i 'll report back asap after that . i have unplugged literally everything except one sata cable , which goes to the ssd . the ssd and my usb stick is the only things showing in the bios .
yeah , i 'd prefer to not send email as rich text . it seems to turn into a real headache real fast ( even though it is doing this one thing right )
: yes
- i 'll make sure to check that , the next time i look at the problem . but , i 'm pretty sure it is .
i lost manual . but in it 's site , it just mentioned number of current rams . and in mb site , it 's not mentioned .
just perform any search in agent ransack . the results show only the line containing the search text . i 'm trying to see one line above and one line below the line containing the text

the particular file i want to view has been created as a memo by a samsung champ duos 2 mobile . it is not a smartphone , but this particular format is very common and is used in various bada/windows/android phones .
i did a more dramatic solution . i downgraded from outlook 2013 to 2007. now everything works fine
more details : the image file is raw , binary copy of partitions ( output of linux ddrescue tool ) . i store the file on wd hard drive connected with usb 3 .
yes , i am not on dsl , i think there is a modem or something on the roof of my house , but that 's not the problem , i apply same settings from my router and put them in the card ipv4 settings , but i get no connection .
not familiar with the command
i 've already undone all that i previously did , so consider me in blank slate state
i do not get any specific error other than the credentials do not work . i would find it really strange that this worked in winxp , it worked in linux but that it does not work in win 8.1 .
dear hannu how to check warning/error after selecting manage ... . ? ? ? ? ?
i think but i 'm not sure it 's coulbe solved by programming
, thanks , i already had that link open , but the intel processor spec finder that is key to the instructions on that page is no longer available .
as requested , the details , they are set to automatic , nothing interesting on the ip setting page , but here there is the fact they are n't in the same ip range ( yes , i have the cross-cable and the direct one ) : ;
yeah it does , however the built in player has the same issues
i use `labels` in `mailings` tab for splitting pages .
sorry last comment got cut-off . i get the following error : 67.xx.x is n't responding on port 1559 ( web2host ) .
is it possible to decrypt my passwords ?
finally fixed it . looking again at the settings in device manager , i noticed that the ide channel was set to `` dma if available '' but under mode it just said `` not applicable . '' that sounded fishy , so i uninstalled the secondary ide channel and re-installed . when the dvd drive came back , the mode was set to ultra dma 2. the stutter is gone .
i was n't sure if it should be back or forward , but it did n't fix the error - but i accidently found the error while testing it so thanks !

the issue occurred in firefox and went away after a full page refresh .

i 'm not sure if this is what you want to hear , but the files sit on my d : / drive which is a data partition of my 256gb ssd . it is a local repository . ps : i have fixed the issue with all files showing up as modified . it was caused by different line endings [ more info here ] ( however it is still slow .

thank you guys . slhck , i am using my own custom code . what i wanted to know is , does a hacker benefit from knowing my personal ip address , maybe to hijack some admin login session .
`` or do you want to send the document to others , and control what their print will look like ? '' that 's exactly what i 'm looking for .
i do n't have any idea about source control . we have just shared a drive in network
- what i 'm really aiming for is something more graphically intensive , say html pages . is this possible ?
so there 's no way to do this in the ui ?
i am able to ping that ip address ( deleted previous incorrect comment ) .
thanks , you are correct , it would be difficult with a complicated setup . here 's the rub , routing tables were simple on both hosts , default gateway , no other routes , that 's what 's so strange . the recipient device is a lantronix universal device server , and it had our old default gateway ip address , which is no longer functioning and there is nothing on the network with that old ip . we had no rip , ospf etc . on either firewall . that 's why we are baffled , why ping worked , when without a proper default gateway on the recipient , it should have failed .
yes i know , therefore i wrote i had tested with a multimeter to get a beep/not beep conclusion . i do n't have equipment to measure impedance termination . maybe there is a way from the software side to see whats going on in more detail ? because i wonder about setting 10 mbps manually will work but the devices do n't get it themselves .
: 10000 folders ... moreover , i also have memory problems even listing one file ! see here :

i tried so many ways . the install of the driver asks for the printer to be connected . i connect it . it does not see it and the only thing to do is stop the install , then it uninstall everything .

as always , this `` emergency tool '' , costs a lot . i know about backups . i keep a triple copy ( in 3 different disks ) of my work while i work . the specific .mdb was not mine . i 'm just trying to help ... : )
i never said the drivers were 64 bits only .
how can i do that though ? i ca n't seem to add a user from a diferent computer . trying to give permission to \\remotepc\remoteuser and windows does n't let me .
, 32-bit ; but that shouldnt matter ( other than the root-branch in the registry ) .
if an internal network allows the host to access the guest then i ca n't see why i could n't use an internal network .
okay that explains at least that , thanks for the comment . still , i ca n't figure out where the rest of the free space went ... running `defrag /a /v` it tells me the mft is 352mb in size , so that 's not occupying the space either . any ideas ?
these cards are 1000x . site says 160mb/s . could be a faulty card or card reader - he 's going to get another brand of both .
ok , question edited
i suppose so , but is it possible to install on a non-certified usb ? is there any way to change the usb from `` removable '' to `` fixed '' , so windows will accept as a to-go drive . is it possible to install onto drive smaller than 32gb ?
i use centos release 6.3. i see parts of the file that was opened/viewed when : q was executed . term was set to linux . changed to term=xterm and it works fine : ) thank you very much fdinoff ( but it does change my colorscheme to default , before was evening , i do not know why )
dave , i have an excel file , but if you know another way , that 's not complicated , please tel me
if all conditions are satisfied price plays no role .
the message i posted comes from the event viewer . or what do you mean ? external backup storage is a 1 tb hdd . the system drive i want to backup has 256 gb . so plenty of space .

done , but it is in czech : - ( i translated that few relevant sentences . ps i suspect that exchange administrator disabled this feature . i asked and now i wait for response .
i administrate a lenovo rd220 server at work . i have not seen anything in the documentation requiring a secondary cpu to be of the same clockspeed as the primary . i may be wrong on this tough . regardless i cant see how this is relevant to the essence of the question .
edit : well , something did fix it but i have no idea what exactly , because i tried a lot of stuff . anyway not installing 368.22 again .
**edit** i do not want an empty frame on the start menu ( or on the log-on screen ) . i want our company logo to display , and i do n't want it to be able to be changed .
small server with only admins .
update -- -- just as more information , c3 and c4 are media centers , android devices and nas enclosures . c1 and c2 are computers but they are too far away from my routers for me to pop in an extra nic and link the two networks together . also i am looking for a solution where i do n't have to leave a computer on 24/7 .
however i could n't connect . it was throwing the following error : > ora-12541 : tns : no listener . how can i fix this ?
this happens with one specific video only in my collection
, slow compared to routine operations . slow compared to what my pc does when i delete a folder which is deleting it in seconds . this one takes hours .
, i think we had a miscommunication there . the user hadnt installed updates in a while , then , after their last batch ( a little over 100 in total ) and restart , they said is when the problem started .
tried the above without any success ...
nope , no luck either .
i 'm running it again with ` -- level=9` instead of 99. we shall see later if the result is reasonable .
actually am using dhcp . 192.168.1.1 is the default getaway .

yea , i meant `oobechk.exe` good catch @ lord torgamus

updated question with it , thanks
no , several extensions . including adblock plus , neater bookmarks etc . i have a way around this problem for those extensions though . i downloaded the crx files , and installed them in developer mode . however , for some weird reason , clearly gets broken if i install it that way .
i used software when i had it working . gpu sat at around 70c when playing gta v on max settings , do n't remember cpu but it was n't too high

the reason may be a bit stupid : ) i just copied a huge directory from my linux machine to my windows machine , and now i just wanted a simple way to make sure that everything got copied ok. so i thought , ill just check the total sizes of both directories on both machines . but the totals were different , so i looked into it , and saw that du includes the size of the directory itself and windows explorer does n't , so i thought maybe there is a way to emulate the explorer-like behaviour for du , because explorer does n't have a whole lof of flexibility : )
ofcourse : ) but i am sure brilliant programmers have a solution for this little problem .
answer to mikaso : yes dhcp is activated on wifi router . see the link answer to c007 ; well i did reboot my wifi router ( 192.168.0.1 ) but not modem router ( 192.168.1.1 ) and thanks again for your quick respond .
sorry , i forgot to mention that i 'm using ubuntu linux . can not bear windows a sec !
i have updated the question according to your comment
if you mean fn-f2 ( f2 being the key with the symbol of a radio antenna ) that is turned on
before i tried the boot cd , it would n't even go into safe mode . when i restart with the boot cd in , it asks for selection of language then goes to only the background screen with no icons and a cursor . i have tried right clicking on the screen and hitting ctrl-alt-del but neither of these does anything .
jenkins - static ips do not work either ; @ john t i did a fresh install off the latest dvd media from red hat
true , i have a tester but i did n't test all the wires , i will run that test and see if its correctly wired or not .
yes that 's right .
that is working perfectly fine ! no problems at all .
: i left out the word excel from the last sentence but that was what i was referring to .
adwcleaner did find some chrome extentions and i removed them . if i run it now it just find extension `found [ extension ] : cgndfbhngibokieehnjhbjkkhbfmhojo` , so apparently this extention has not be removed . i never use ie but when i start it now there is a warning : `` an external programs wants to change the defaul search engine ''

it 's the existing hardware .
there is no change in routing table before and after it stops working , but i edited my original post and added the routing table .
daniel , yes , exactly .
nice , is it worth me trying to fix this question ?
is it ? sorry i only use stack overflow ( as you can probably tell from my rep score ) i thought this was the stack for this kind of question
much the same as `ip a` but adds some stats on data transferred . no `wlan` interface sadly .
i use gnome user interface and i get this behavior on chrome . for example when i want to select the url address i press ctrl+a but , the cursor moves to the beginning of the url .

i ran `sudo` . as you can tell , my sh*t 's messed up .
thank you for the suggestions . unfortunately : 1 ) both paths ( and all files involved ) are way shorter than max_path . 2 ) we have the updates installed suggested in kb2891362 . 3 ) as far as i 'm aware we 're not using dfs ( but i 'll verify that tomorrow ) . 4 ) yes , the machines are in a domain .
the samly is already given in the question itself . i 'm trying to replace all the occurrences of double spaces with single space in my document .

- no . and in fact it gets weirder - i installed bootcamp and windows 7 and am getting the exact same problem under windows . however i 'm getting neither issue on my own ( 2007 ) macpro running exactly the same os version and software .
i was hoping the solution would be at most bash version specific , not distro-specific . if it 's relevant , i use mostly rhel 5 and 6 .
nope . i ca n't hear any clicking sounds .
using bootable pendrive . also tried ubuntu 14.10 but getting error `` /install/vmlinuz file not found '' .
no , this is a copy i made of an old hard drive . i did n't realize the copy was bad until i got rid of the drive . i have a bunch of files , but many of them are damaged ( filled with , or mostly filled with nul bytes ) . i want to simply delete the damaged files , leaving what is left .
i am changing hard disk , but are you really sure ? because they are so many components in pc example : ram etc
: it slow down about 3 month to now .
thanks , ta , for your suggestion . but , unfortunately , that is n't the case : s
logging in would be preferable . if i ca n't , i 'll pull the drive and throw it in an external drive .
( of my choosing ) instead
yes , of course .
nice idea . unfortunately i did n't find a way to access cygwin 's bash terminal with this approach .
lmaoo ... on one end a lot , on another end not too much ! i think it has more to do with videos where the presenters say a lot of fluff per unit of actual material that i 'm interested in
kind of what i 've done in the meanwhile . i selected `` value not equal to '' and put 999999999999. then the odds of it ever being exactly that value are pretty small i supposed , just feels a bit hackish .
i 'm running `sync` after each `dd` , if that 'd eliminate what you 're getting me to check for . ( i 'm doing it now anyway , it 'll just take a little while )
, those commands in the question did not work and neither did the gs commands work . something in the pdf caused the problem .

: ethernet make the problem go away . load average is very small ( 0.02 ) , i do n't do much with the box right now - just hooked it up ...
alas , no , i never did find a cause of this . it 's _possible_ that it 's because i have my users folder hardlinked to another drive , but i have n't had the chance to reformat my machine to test that theory .
no , it 's disabled .
noted i will refrain from open ended questions like this .
external hdd . : (
i 'm not sure what version number , but it 's an older one ( i actually got an email from dropbox warning met o update it before it lost support ) . i get to that error after typing in `dropbox upgrade` , it looking and finding an update , downloading it , and then attempting to install . during the installation process that happens and it fails .
edit 2 : ***if this possible on excel or open office ? ***
i do n't play game on this laptop
: i can script the mounting , for sure . the backup is the issue , due to conventional tools not working and lack of a workaround for those tools that understand reparse points .
when connection lost computer makes a sound , just like when i plug adaptor out .
i do the tracert command , and i think the problem is in the host
yes , but then if i want to bookmark and close all windows i would need to press : ctrl-shift-d , enter , ctrl-shift-w ...
i do n't think it is from the original equipment manufacturer . when i bought it said it was compatible with my laptop , but not the exact model . ( ex : battery is for dv6 , dv7 , dv ... ; laptop model is dv6 61203 bleh bleh bleh ... . )
it is a netgear dgn 1000
ah ! yes i did mean to use a password . i 've been testing , testing , testing , and mistakenly left that option out . adding back in `-pmypassword` to the command did the trick and i can see `ae-256 deflate` when opened in windows . can you post as an answer and i 'll accept ?

i am trying to found it but i am not very used with the bios so it is very difficult to me : / how it seems to appeared the line in which it puts it ? like model ?
good point . the image on this box is pointing directly at the install directory though .
do you think boot order can occure this ? i think it 's ubs > hdd > uefi , but i am not at home at the moment . i opened boot menu ( f11 ) every time i wanted to boot from usb .
i tried linux mint xfce & twas nice overall . when it came time to upgrade this week , accidentally installed gnome version which was subtly slow . btw , all these news about a new version of linux mint , was it only for the gnome version ? all other mint flavors are still at v9 . once tried fluxbox briefly ( or was it openbox ? ) & found accessing menu via desktop mouse right click odd for usability . i may be far techier than average ppl but @ heart i just want something that works . hence , my current situation : trying to see which linux mint is the best . btw , is fluxbox faster than xfce ?
no , system is not configured to use proxy .

1 ) if i ping from the computer that 's connected to dd-wrt router all the pings time out . not sure what you mean with `` reach an external ip . '' if i do n't get a reply from ping i guess it does n't , right ? if i ping from dd-wrt interface it works ( ping , i.e . ) 2 ) the wireless router is on a 192.168.1.x subnet , i assigned a 192.168.2.x subnet for the dd-wrt router . when connected to dd-wrt i get a correct ( i say ) 192.168.2.108 ( usually ) ip . thanks .

thanks ramhound - i 'm a bit thick ( a bit ? a lot ! ) so not sure how to answer that . where would i find that out ? interested to hear you have no problems - there is hope then !
you obviously do n't understand the functionality and purpose of the `` answer your own question '' feature in the `` ask a question '' page , given your accusation of point farming , which is just silly . i would recommend reading the post that **thatbrazilianguy** shared . it covers the topic quite well , and gives an example of someone answering their question while simultaneously asking it . rather than continue to argue about how stackexchange works in comments , i 'd be open to moving this discussion to chat instead .

it turns out my service provider only deals out private ip 's to 3g based connections , so there is no sensible way to get an always-on public site with my current telco .

it wont accept the bitocker password .
yes , i 'm connecting via http or port other than 443 gives different error message ( webpage not accessible ) . so the service is definitely there , it just rejects my attempt to connect for some reason .

forum software is phpbb . i made a comment to a moderator which could have been interpreted as a silly hyperbolic diss or as a hateful vitriolic insult . it was intended as the former , but they interpreted it as the latter . i emailed to explain and apologize , but they did n't respond , and when i made a new account , i got banned again after the first post . i always figured they found my second account through some automated background process .

i would n't know . i did n't have the old realtek control panel installed before windows 10 , and windows 10 just automatically installed it ( over and over and over again ) . i found a workaround with the control panel and will post it later
please read the 3 infos i just added , they all suggest that this is not a power suplly issue , notr a hardware issue , but a power setting issue .
the machine uses non-standard communication cards that do n't have drivers , but are controlled directly by kernel mode software running on xp embedded . virtualbox and the kernel mode software do n't work well together .
my thoughts exactly ! : )
when i shutdown or restart guest os which is oracle linux , virtual box and guest os hangs or freezes during the restart or shutdown when it reaches at this point . `virtualbox acpi : pci interrupt for device 0000:00:11.0 disabled` . regards
actually depends on the value of the cell which is calculated average from a pivot table . if value is 0 to 4 color = red , if value = 5 color = yellow , if value 6 or 7 then color = green .
here 's how i 'm trying to connect : as for the host ip ... ifconfig says 10.0.2.15 but i 'm using virtualbox to attach the virtual network adapter via nat so i think in-so-far as everything else it 's concerned it 's 192.168.1.34 i guess..
-- -- -- -- -- edit : shame on me . between the router and the switch was another router hidden in a wardrobe that set up its own subnet . turning off the dhcp solved the problem , now the main-router is the only device assigning ip-adresses and every device is in the same subnet . thanks for all answers and comments ! maybe this whole question can be deleted as in the end the reason for the problem was a different than stated in the question .

the format itself has been a standard for years , and will not be going away anytime soon , because many customers still have mainframes . for this reason , i was hoping to give customers ( and me ) an `` easy '' way to view and verify the format of the file before they send it . windows would be the preferred platform .

you 're probably right when you say that my decision of having just one large partition is n't the best , anyway , i ca n't split it into more partitions , because the limitation ( in mbr ) of a maximum of 2tb is at `` disk level '' . so ( for example ) , i 'm not able to split it into two 1.5 tb partitions .

well then i suppose i need a supercomputer to achieve this . i thought i could save some money by using a single hardware but there is definitely more to this than i expected it to be . thanks
: i do n't necessarily want the entire gui to be english - since ms apparently , incredibly , charges money for that . but i can not handle the keybindings .
is it safe to suspend process ?
i 'm willing to try anything that you think would work , honestly . good catch , my bad there - they are dashes , not forward slashes . habit . lol
i am using a retail version !
way to use
thanks . no , i do n't want to disassemble the thing . just remove the internal hard-drive from its external enclosure ( i.e . the internal hard-drive as sold in stores ; not the bare , disassembled drive ) . see edited op .
it was working before just fine . i had n't used it for about a month , and decided to give the computer to my mom . while setting it up ( last week ) , i discovered this problem . the card is a galaxy brand nvidia geforce gt 440 , and does not have a power connector to the card . i 've tested both the monitor and graphics card in my current computer , and they both work fine . i have n't looked for bent pins , but i 'll check it out .
i 've got office 2003 , office 2010 starter and office 365 installed
thanks . excel for mac 2011 , 14.6.3. i could upgrade if the solution is easier .
i 'm not sure ( either ) , how do i check . i 've included shots of the bios if it helps .
on the target computer im trying to install windows on when i press f12 to boot from network it goes through and gives me the device mac address and then the does a whole bunch of ... ... ... .. and then it boots to windows . it never gives me an option to enter an ip address .
error is with end with line `` compile error end with without with ``
it is working correctly on my centos 5.5 install .
i would most likely use/try both a proxy and a vpn .
, thanks for being the vigilante ; ) no as a student of my university i have all the licenses necessary from microsoft and vmware to do this and was also suggested by my lecturer should anyone want to work from home .
i linked to the exact solution .
that the german version of outlook is the one that has the ( imho ) broken translation and produces aw instead of re . i want something for os x mail to work around that , since microsoft clearly does not care about this and will probably never fix it .
no . if i use -s 1452 , there will be no fragment and the total length is 1500 .
password in bios . the password when the lappy boots up , that is the bios one , i guess .
( k , t or w )
my client pc 's run windows , but i have a dedicated pc where i can install about any software .
yep - only safari
no it did n't , so i know i am not doing it right . i just do n't know where to change the source . i may need to rerun `sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure`
sorry if i seem vague . when i say it freezes , it stalls completely ( always at the same point of the progress bar ) . i left it for more than 30 minutes and it did not continue . maybe it would be better if i repeat my steps and i provide more details , in order to not waste your time .
that last sentence was more for if it did n't always work .
i am using an iso for the installer image . however i need to insert an _additional_ media containing my answers.xml file .
i am running os x .

it 's cox . i 'm guessing that 's what is going on . now i need to figure out how to get around that .
: do you have a source for this ? i 'm pretty sure that most motherboards contain only one or two controlllers , or at least that was the standard about 1-2 years ago .
i tried to copy the recovery disk to the recovery partition using cp -r in linux and marking the partition as hidden and recovery with gparted . i also tried with dd but with no luck cause the recovery unit made by windows is larger ( 30gb ) than the original altough only 22gb are used . no luck in bootig from it afterwards
: i live in germany . here , pirating software is not theft . it is copyright infringement . violating the eula is copyright infringement , too . i would be surprised if any court was warped enough to see that differently .
rewrote question .
: only about ~2000 in that folder .
- no via dell 's website . you can pick cpus , memory and such . i guess `` building '' is a bit misleading . i should have said , `` selecting features '' or something like that
that 's a good question , but i do n't control the onelogin radius server , and i do n't know how to see the certificates - `openssl s_client` is of no use here i think , as radius works over udp ?
yes . it 's my family . i pay part of the bill .
it is on the machine self , if you type is `` cseh 001 '' on google images it will be the first one , could not find anything on the manual , might of missed it
would it then be easier to just go back to windows 8 , put the 1070 in , then download windows 10 ?
i turned off firewall and tried but no luck

i tried to bridge lan and wlan , then share my dongle to that bridge , but it did not work . how do i do all this without a physical router ?
yes , it does appear there .
nope , tried google.com and it resolved the ip but got same result
-- - more information : if i remove the xorg.conf file , the original problem goes away but the monitor shows off center and with corruption around the edges . if i just comment out everything in the file , i get the original problem back . [ 1 ] :

if they were deleted it would n't show a size . for example , one folder size is 3269 kb , but the folder shows no emails .
& tldr ; a power user performs a certain amount of write cycles . does an mlc ssd drive support enough write cycles to last a power user around 5 years of usage . my first experience was my drive went cranky after 9 months . is this a dud drive or acceptable based on my usage ?
wired , i 've checked all the connection , when i did n't need to as it works perfectly well when using xp partition on this computer .
they must be running but i have not started them or if i have started them i have closed them . i think it may perhaps be a setting somewhere that i have changed ... just wish i knew what setting .
in fact they are not . it absolutely looks like it but there are hundreds of changes and several newly generated files in these folders and subfolders .

tnx , it 's not my native language : - )
i had stopped dns client and dns server services . windows firewall is running .
i ended up using hyper v on my local system . you can go this route and get the vhd file and then create your vm in azure using a custom vhd and upload the one you made with hyper v. there are a few tutorials out there that will walk you through it . sorry i do n't have them from memory .

omg ! it 's my question again . it 's been so long . *kiss*
: yes , i said software raid as oktosite pointed out . no , i did n't confuse raid 1 with raid 0 , as i specifically mentioned read speeds as tog pointed out . @ tog : i never said i only have one drive . i have four hard drives . thank you all for taking a look at my question .
look at my posting : `the services ( .. are running ) ` . compared the command lines with another well working w7 , no difference .
yes the cable is connected presently .
sorry , my internet completely went down . i will put the ipconfig info in for you
no , i 'm talking about changing descriptions , icons , and non-default actions for any and all file types .
on the us keyboard the `` = '' / '' + '' key is left of backspace . on the german keyboard the `` '' / '' ` '' key is left of backspace . if i type that key ( left of backspace ) i get `` = '' and if i type it with `` shift '' i get `` + '' as it should be on the us keyboard . was that your question ? the other keys work as well as they should work on an us keyboard .

yes , these spikes are also occurring when pinging google.com
this is happening on windows 7 , windows 8 and windows 8.1. i do n't know about vista .
yes i do see high physical memory usage even if i quit chrome . however i have my e-mail server which is on vm & mcafee is required to secure the internet and lan , as this is a live server vm . thou high memory usage was not there before 2-3 days as this system was ruining vm and mcafee at that time also . and at that time it use to show good memory usage of 5 gb around avg . so there must be some problem i think which is causing this high memory usage issue ... ? ?
it 's `mon0` . wlan1 is not even shown in the wireshark capture interfaces dialog .
what about skydrive ? if i can do it natively for free , then why should i go for third party solution ?

jesus christ it worked ! ! ! i thought adding rsync path in environment would be enough . if you want add your comment as an answer and i 'll accept it . thanks a ton matey !
yes . i am seeking advice on how 127.0.0.1 is handled . is this typically put on a whitelist ? i assumed localhost would be ignored in the firewall .
**update : ** learning about traffic monitoring using wireshark . better starting point than throwing darts at a wall . here is what i 'm seeing thus far : - excessive netbios calls due to dns setting oversight . i have a domain controller and it turns out non-domain computers are not updating active directory integrated dns ( zone properties-general-dynamic updates : `` nonsecure and secure '' ( high risk , prefer dhcp update ) . - excessive tcp retransmissions . no answer yet .

something like restoring partition table by **testdisk**

not at the time those particular commands had been issued . i had done a complete reboot just prior to that .
on chrome , no net access whatsoever . on internet explorer , it is very slow .

had n't thought about handling it like that , but the vba you posted below does exactly what i needed . great idea !
sorry , forgot to comment that here . i did test the ethernet connection for some hours , and it did n't present any issue . i 'm going to run the test while gaming ( both wirelessly and wired ) and have it output to a file . if i were to determine the problem is originated on the wireless card , what should i do ? toshiba reps seemed pretty inconsiderate , ignoring the comments i made about switching machines and testing drivers , and recommended i installed some toshiba distributed old drivers and last resort , restoring to a factory image ( which i specifically stated beforehand i had already done ) .

first sentance covers the con of tc volumes . and this this question is n't too specific . how is a secure solution specific ? with all of the prism stuff going on ( very relevant ) we can see first hand that conglomerate `` privacy '' software is potentially rigged and unsecured . the idea that the application which generates your private keys is network connected to a central server is not secure . as for the second point , yes ramhound ... any question which involves enumerating software is often voted to closed here . usually without considering the actual content of the question .

i have n't gotten any effect from doing that specifically . but on a related note , after the problem happens but starts clearing up , i can consistently aggravate it simply by folding the screeb forward . this action does n't normally have an effect . it is only after having the issue then it begins clearing up on its own .

hi . thanks for the suggestion . i must say that it does n't seem more portable than nfs , and more specifically i can not imagine that such a product is faster than a well configured nfs share . it actually seems to be a graphical interface for editing , displaying and such - which would then have to reside on a nfs partition .
: i am not sure what i did but atm on my ntfs drives it moves instantaneously . i dont know if its because i disabled `` remote differential compression '' ( or if it was something fixed in one of the windows updates .
what do you mean ? i can dig , tho .
it 's a 5750-6589. it does have a media key utility . as far as i was able to determine , it was n't a case of both programs trying to skip ahead , since if i disabled the utility or disabled winamp 's media key support the media keys would stop working altogether .

yes already did that and like i said once i unplug it i do n't seem to have that problem anymore ( i had the same setup for over 4 months now and it just happened to start the same time i installed this ata adapter ) .
yes , i want cd to cd . i will try the 2 products recommended below , and see which one i will recommend to her . thanks , all .

it is correct that i actually want to add `` more '' than 53 days because some of them are sundays
yes , i get usb storage and removable disk . i tried both but i get no operating system found . @ ramhound i do not see any option in the bios about legacy/compatability mode not sure what you mean by efi media .
change that to subfolder .
its out of necessity at the moment ; its a home server , and the idiots that installed the broadband connection installed it two floors down ... it 'll be fully cabled up once i 've finished the build ...

so why did this get migrated ? i think hardware registers are a good fit for electronics ?
it is a wall socket . i 've checked the connection on both ends and cables seem to be in the right order
no , as a primary drive .
how i do this ( be sure that you have a lvm support in your initram ) ? sorry for the silly question .
i fixed it the problem was i accidentally disable login for those users instead of disabling auto login

yes ... i am on wifi . at the time i have no way of getting a network cable to my machine . is there a way to see if the wifi is the cause before i go ripping into the walls to install ethernet jacks ?
sorry cable subscription here in srilanka means the cable telephone line , not the cable subscription you are referring to your country , it 's a local thing , sorry to put it like that ! in our country we have two telephone connections , cdma and telephone line connection , i was referring to telephone line connection when i stated cable connection !

i am using mstsc . i have updated the title to specify `` remote desktop connection '' for clarification .
duly noted , but if you read my post , it is related to a computer issue . in so far as it is not syncing to my surface .
the problem occurs in both chrome and firefox , but strangely not in ie
is what the bios recognizes in the boot menu . when windows 7 setup utility starts i can get to the part where windows asks you to set up a drive to install the os onto , but every partition [ there 's like , 6 of them , the two main partitions , the recovery file , and a couple other un-named partitions ] says windows can not be installed because of the partition format .
yes , i could i guess . did n't even occur to me . this is n't the kind of thing i would see putting in inittab ( but maybe i should ? ? ) . and putting in a init script to do it seems even bigger overkill , but maybe i 'm just off base ?
there is a gpu integrated into the cpu , ( pentium 4 ) but i do n't belive there is one attached to the motherboard . i am currently using an nvidia 8400 in a pci-e slot
i know how to solve the problem in ie . importing the root certificate in the root store , and then unchecking `` warn if adresses in certificates does not match '' , solves the problem for every ssl site . what im asking for , is how to disable the hostname check in chrome .
@ edit i went berserk and reseted the router to factory settings , it works now , but the solution may have been a little desperate .
i 'm running vmware in windows-7
, i want to get a general performance metric to know , e.g. , that a last patch slowdown certain machines or installed software makes outlook starts in 8 minutes . so i get information ( after week of collecting data ) that i make a change which slowed down 20 % of my machines .
that seems to revert back to the microsoft stock driver , but i do n't know enough about how display drivers work to know if upon re-enabling the device the driver has been restarted from scratch or if it retains some of its state . it did n't solve my problem unfortunately .
no i did n't try psexec could you give me an example ? i can open a remote powershell session whithout problem the problem is that it just start the regular powershell . i would prefer to start the powershell with my module already loaded but doing it from the remote session might be more hard because i do n't know the installation path of the module at this point . i saw some information about pssessionconfiguration which allow a startup script but i 'm not sure its the good way to go .

hi @ ramhound , my system disk is c , not d. i 'm not sure why c is `` disk 1 '' instead of `` disk 0 '' , though . probably because of their order on the sata interfaces . it boots just fine on drive c .
ehm , it 's an inventel livebox . ( never heard of them either . it 's a combi adsl modem / wireless router / print server / internet television box ? ) no-one else in the house has issues connecting .
yes , i 'm using `ksh` because i have a `for` loop in the script and i need to call variables from that loop , `bash` does not support this .
no idea -- it 's not reliably reproducible . i typically run with a _ton_ of background stuff , though , so one of those is likely the issue . your answer is comprehensive , and it 's unlikely that there exists a `` magic bullet '' of the nature i was hoping for .
, i followed the first example at [ emacs wiki ] ( however not the lines starting with bindkey . using escape ^^ does not work , then screen says ^a is still the command key . it says on that same page that the first letter '^^ ' defines the command key and the second key '^^ ' defines the literal insertion key , whatever that means .
good question : )
no , it 's not a good solution because it involves reinstalling the os just to fix this small bug . i 've spent literally 5 minutes trying stuff from the internet because there 's not that much on the issue .
yes , i ran it at lvl1
fixed that , thank you !
i did it as root . i did not know $ means non-root sorry . @ wurtel

is that relevant ? if you must know , i 'm trying to port forward moonbase alpha by nasa . see my comment below .
hundreds of files making it impractical to do by hand . the names of the files in the archive would need to be fetch programmatically .
: the installation that succeeded identifies as `kernel 3.2.0-24-generic-pae` . i 'm *guessing* that the installer uses this version or something close ; it was just released .
i have the windows boot option . like in this pic
meter was connected directly to sound card 's output , so just sound card . i expect that speakers/headphones and similar devices do have their own limitations .
sorry if it was n't clear . i have cable service and cable modem obviously . i do n't have dsl service , but i have my own dsl modem that happen to have wireless built-in and i want to reuse the wireless part of it to connect one more pc
i *can* connect via an ssh client using the user name and password . some login details fail with vsftpd login .

even with aptitude , i failed to install krb5-multidev , i have added details above .
the script runs by itself . it 's root 's crontab , i could n't edit it as zuusu .
hi kazark ! it is a pdf document opened in word 2013 and the headings appear formatted the same as the rest of text , not as a header . it does look fine , but i need to remove the horizontal line and the text above from each page because i want to retain only the entries and their content , to be able to delimit it in excel . i was wondering if there 's a macro that can be used to cut off the top portion of text on every page , or maybe some other method to do this .
( 1 ) i want a directory junction ( /j flag ) so that the links are resolved server-side if i want to share this directory through a network . ( 2 ) i will try the /h option and give some feedback ( i first have to sort out some admin privileges , sigh )
i 'm not exactly sure why that 's necessary , but i 've pasted it anyways .
too much for tail in that the number of lines was unpredictable so i could n't be sure that tail -f n 200 would be enough
the magic packets are sent from my android phone with special wol-programs ( ex . depicus ) , but they `` hit '' my pc only right after the pc-shutdown .
you mean , to remap win+r to my own path ? do you have a solution for that ?
__edit__ : as @ gd1 said , theapp.app is a folder ( it 's called bundle in osx i think ) and so it is not executable . but i still need a workaround :
hm . i had n't noticed that there was a round of updates . just checked , and since i updated at the end of january , they 've dropped over 2gb of updates .
i did n't generate the pdf . the slides may contain text or images . windows and linux solutions are both ok .
but then i will be stuck with an old version of firefox and miss other updates and face security risks etc .
they are scatter over several folders on a computation cluster which i do n't wish to run script on . i guess that this is an option con consider though .
no , but that site will trigger the problem reliably .
: added more information to my original post .
: yes , i 've checked the update status of each , though not 100 % sure they 're current .
here is the version :
bingo ! i am in face using cisco anyconnect vpn . i updated /etc/hosts.ac file and it now persists the changes . please put this as an answer and i 'll accept it .
torrent appears to be working .
windows 8.1 , it 's in the tag .
glenn , if anyone really needs to compress files it is people with low disk space - this is an important problem to solve . questioning the notability of the files is not very productive , it is 2011 , we live in the gmail era .
. i think i did n't make myself clear , so here 's an edit : i want to turn off this technology so my graphics card performance wo n't get reduced on battery power
there 's no other type of account to choose in the messaging app ...
sorry , i do n't understand . parameter `-a` requires a specific app to open with , and `-w` waits until the app that was open is closed . my understanding from `man open` is that it has no options that might be useful for this ?
it 's a alias defined in my host file ( c : \windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts ) , not a external url . he is pointing to local address .
because they come preconfigured with the same ip address , and i have to configure them ( ip address and some other things ) . so i want to make process faster for me .
yes i plugged it in all the way , no response from my computer and the sound is still coming from the pc 's speakers .
that was it ! i do n't know how that one got hit and there is no light telling you that f-lock is engaged . much appreciated .
the department dropdowns are all on the same page . they get their options from a different page though .
with putty directly in the windows guest
in my particular case , because parted does n't resize btrfs yet . but one could , say , want two filesystems in one partition , so the second is somewhat hidden .
if you were to move the mouse slightly , i imagine so . i do n't have a mouse at work , only this pen . however , the pen is so light it 's easy to slightly shift it while depressing the button . the fact that the threshold for moving the mouse is seemingly 1 pixel is so frustrating .
axel kemper - yes that 's what i am going to do if there are no other options ... but i guess there is always a way to fake it , when the client has full access on the computer
yes .xlsm ; all cells in all sheets automatically changed from whatever i set , to date .
well , it was where i could delete my preferences folder out of my system level library and reboot and i could then ping 127.0.0.1 and localhost successfully . now when i reboot doing the same i can only ping 127.0.0.1 and localhost is still `` ping : can not resolve localhost : unknown host ''
by attaching a vga cable to it .
here 's the results for the same test on her system : - ping : 22ms - download speed ; 8.44mbps - upload speed : 1.02mbps
hi , my modem/router has google 's dns setted up . i think my network pc 's use netbios because of avahi .
i have tried connecting the 3.5mm cables into the jacks yes and it does not seem to work . @ ramhound another headset i have works perfectly fine on this computer , plus the laptop 's speakers work , so i do n't see how this could be a problem with the sound card drivers .
, no dumps at all . it should be saved as ' % systemroot % /memory.dmp ' , but there is no such file .

- @ david : yes . - frank thomas : indeed . - doenoe : open them in windows photo viewer . - dave : nice trick , but the list can be quite long .
thanks for the suggestion . as it happens , got it working a couple minutes after posting . i did two things , so it 's one or the other : 1 ) turned on global font lock and 2 ) ran an elisp script i found on emacswiki that `` filled in '' the color names or some dumb thing .
sorry if i was n't clear , i installed the latest drivers ( for windows 8 ) for my gtx550ti , and i do n't have the option for 1920x1080 resolution . if i change to 1920x1080 by the nvidia control panel , i still ca n't have that resolution while playing games , and its really annyoing . its like my windows does n't support this resolution
my posted got edited . i do n't need a browser to be opened with root permissions . i need a way to determine if an `open` command was launched with root permissions in os x .
i do not think that the mere presence of the line violates the standards - it 's the fact that it matches the email address ( from our domain ) , without any whitelabel for the email service having being set up . i am confident ( but not 100 % sure ) the email provider for the said application is sendgrid . have spoken to sendgrid , and they said that the only way the return-path can match the email address ( in our domain ) is if the w.l has been set up .
exactly , to the root precedents if possible , but one step down is also okay , if i can do it repeatedly
i hear music from pandora and youtube on chrome , i dont know if it support 5.1 but it used to work on all speakers . i dont remember if i duplicated the audio to the rear speakers . if i did so , how can i do it again ? i probably did it about 4 years ago .
he uses boot camp and os x 10.8.5. if this would work without additional tools it surely would be the best solution . is there some ressource where i could read about how to encrypt a multi-boot mac using the os x fde ?
i replaced the battery and save the settings it saved only for once and when i restart it will give me the same beep sound .
at how this can be done
: i added a space followed by a # end - same error ... . ? did i do that right ? ( see updated post )
it is set to 7 and false , not sure what it refers to . i checked many articles about messing with some true|false values , but it all applied only to focusing search bar instead . turns out that it was caused by daemon tools lite .
[ new update : workaround ] i found that this issue is specific to xhci . in my bios i was able to actually disable xhci and force linux to fall back to ehci ( presumably ) . now all my devices are working just fine ! . of course this means no usb3 devices for me . fortunately my immediate application does not require them . i do n't know if this is an intel issue or a linux issue . it would be good to leave this page up because someone else is very like to find it .
no , still not solved : (

sorry , i should have been clearer . i mean i no longer have the truecrypt cd you 're forced to burn during the encryption process .
well , i did use tcpdump to monitor eth0 / wlan0 traffic , in order to see if tcp and udp is going on the expected interface .
since the files in a user account wo n't interfere with others usage of the system , i do n't see why this can be a problem . the root account can be used for common operations like installing software to be used by everyone .
it is working , but i want to make it a bootable usb and i ca n't pick it in softwares like unetbootin
hi sorry it is confusing . i am connecting from windows to the bitnami server with putty . the bitnami server itself is running linux . i am trying to connect to github from the linux server .
it 's not , i 'm using this on my local machine , so maybe i should just set up mutt and be done with it .
i did n't and if you mainly want to run windows on it i would n't recommend it .
i formatted the external hdd with fat32 , but nothing changed ...
otherwise can i use ascii codes to enter the characters to log in ?
: i 'm connecting to the ubuntu server from a windows machine . this is how i access the server , and yes i can keep the priv key on the windows machine . also , yes i can connect to the box directly from the windows machine , but the goal is to run cronjobs in the server and push to the box .
i 'm not sure . i 'm using an lcd monitor , and if i change the res to 60hz it 's horrible . anyway , i 'll try to find a person who owns that monitor .
it 's a personal pc
edited my question with concern to yours .
no , i ca n't get to bios . turning it on does nothing . it 's totally unresponsive . it 's like a brick . i think i might just rma the unit.. ( hopefully me installing another os is under warranty )
: in agriculture the area size of a leaf is an important factor for analyzing the quality of a plant . so i want to know if it 's possible to scan the leaves and determine their area size using photoshop .
hi hennes , the files are located in unix box and i need to copy those files in to a windows box . windows box is with in the firewall and linux box out side the firewall . i am planning to create a command line interface that need to connect to the linux box and copy the files in to windows box .
i wanted to , but it seems i ca n't . i tried to play with the eclipse a little , and found out that it probably has nothing to do with android sdk . when hitting 'details ' in the error message , the following text is presented : an internal error occurred during : `` compute launch button tooltip '' . org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/coremodel @ xavierjazz
nope , i just want my linux server which is running rhel not to authenticate alix from the ldap server but from /etc/passwd file . hope this make it more clear .
. it happens in all programs , and regardless of who 's logged in
it 's still terrible . and daniel , regarding the mbps vs mbps , you 're right ! *facepalm* never even noticed that !
os is windows ( added above ) , and if possible i want to avoid re-encoding , because i do n't want to loose quality . - what does nle stand for ?
i transcoded to h264 in an mkv container , but it was extremely blocky when streamed to my xbox and ps3 . streaming the original m2ts was smooth and high-quality , but the files are a bit too large for storage . so i want just to remove unused languages and subtitles to make them smaller without loosing any quality .
if possible i would like to xfer it over the net .
our software uses the gpu to calculate 3d cloth rendering in real time . as our service goes online , we need a way to multiply and answer demand in real time as well . currently , we are looking for in-house dev env . as well as to learn and burn when needed .
well , i have a couple different printers : one usb , and a few network printers . the printer properties dialog box does n't work for any of them in word , but it does work for all of them in other programs , which suggests to me that the problem is with word itself .
+1 @ daniel beck that would be the answer . i guess it can be used for wired as well as wireless connections . i would use it to compare the sequence of packets exchanged on successfully connecting the nas to xp , with those of the unsuccessful attempt to connect with windows 7. does the too provide facilities to compare 'recorded ' packets in this way ? if you make it an answer , i will likely accept it , after leaving the question open a little longer to give others a chance to contribute .
it affects whether or not i can transfer it later .
yeah , that 's it : - ) i di n't find it my current font . however , my question is a but more general , whether word has such advanced unicode capabilities . i suppose not , unfortunatelly .
**edit : downgrade to the version below latest and it works ! **
actually works quite nice , just like mentioned tail -f will just jump to end file after you have came to end of file with more .
it was not that it is particularly unsuitable , i was simply curious as to if there was a better alternative .
yes exactly i do not have the hardware to have print server.the printer does not have a capability to connect to ethernet switch .
there are 2 reasons why i did n't simply try before asking ; the first is the lack of faith i have in my own understanding of linux - if it had worked i would have still not trusted its reliability if i come to rely on it . the second is the the superuser community is , generally speaking , awesome and quick to help those who ask - thanks community .
tried disabling it , no change . now restarting does n't help anymore either , i 'm at a loss
one connection , not one command .
yes . in my case , it would be multiple soup.io user 's feed .
yes the device log out from existing user .
i simply open up the properties window of the mounted drive .
basically the f5 switched the window , and the ctrl+a is still in the buffer , waiting for another command .
i 'll test these things the next time it happens . thank you .
if i ] increase the resolution of the virtual xp the vmware window gets horizontal and vertical scroll bars instead of the whole thing fitting in one big window . also it seems a bit slow . it 's better for me if i can get a dual system to run
the bluetooth device model is realtek . i have tried downloading the latest drivers but it did n't solve the problem .
that 's a good question . the process of zipping went really quick , way to quick for a > 2gb text file , so i new something was fishy . in the end we restored the file from the backup .
i wanted to know first if there was any software based way to test the ram , the second slot is hard to access ( behind the motherboard of the laptop ) . if there 's not , i 'll try switching them tomorrow and see what happens .
all values of col c are unique & do n't have duplicate .
yes , it 's an i5-480m and in control panel > power options > cpu min/max it 's at 100 %

well , i do n't need these folks to listen to the files , i need the podcast to be listed in itunes .
yes , i can log in via user/pass , but not useful with rsa keys .
i 've just answered that in the update ; thanks for asking , i should have remembered to check that before posting the question , even though it was n't the problem .
i 'm running nat on the router . yes the wan port on the router is plugged into the sb6121 . the laptop and router can communicate to the open net and modem with high fidelity and consistency .
btc keyboard , genius mouse .
currently i 'm not in my college room , i 'll be back there on monday . i have no idea how to obtain that information , i 'm not a system administrator and i 'm not practical in configuring networks . i use kde 's network manager with all options to `` automatic '' . if you would tell me which configuration files contain that information or how to retrieve it i may be able to post it here ( although , i repeat , i 'm currently not connected to that router and i wont be until monday ) .

this issue is when i go to web that supports ipv6 and ipv4 with the same hostname ( www.sixxs.net , www.kame.net ) i land on the ipv4 site and not the ipv6 site like is supposed to happen .
i 've tried many variants of specifying the port . ame result .
the access points have to be scattered throughout the building , and they plug into existing network drops . we 're limited by the locations of existing drops in the classrooms .
all servers are running amazon linux ( centos ) and i 'm running osx locally . added these details to the question .
there 's no internet connection . it 's a closed network . fully local
i must admit i find it funny that people ask questions to me that are already covered in my answer . it 's wired , does not have wifi card in it as it 's a stationary machine . i will see if there are drivers to update for the card , but what i hope for is an answer to exactly why it happens . it may not ever happen again , or it may suddenly become a serious , repeating issue . in short , i hope someone had a similar issue , able to pin-point the exact reason . because i do n't want it to happen while i am in the middle of something .
sorry , linux : )
that 's answered in the op . unless i am missing something ...
because i do n't want to switch and then re-open the file in vim
no , i have n't yet

many thanks to you all . i also do n't mind spending to get the job done , but being not so a geek , i need simple solution with total security . i do have back ups so if something goes wrong , i can do it all over again . so what is the simplest way ? thank you all .
actually the problem is solved beacause i found an xp key . anywas i have a seperate win 8 key but if you activate it without having xp or higher installed previously you get an error .

hello everyone ! if i wanted to learn self-control , i would n't have posted this question here ; i am rather curious about whether this is actually technically feasible or not . so , i kindly request you to refrain from personally attacking and judging my self-control ability instead of offering technical solutions to the problem . i am surprised to see such unprofessional behaviour on stackexchange .

`` it might be an idea to rewrite the question explaining symptoms . a couple of problems - by kernel do you mean `` in-memory '' version of the filesystem '' - of course , .. i can not envision any other possible interpretation on a running system . `` also , is this a problem with the filesystem ? '' sorry , i thought it was fairly descriptive - i.e . the root directory is blank , yet i can access subdirectories directly . `` would the correct answer not be to scp the files to another system and rebuild your problem system ?

there is no filesystem on it . that is the reason i tried to create a partition , so that i could then format it . do you have any suggestion ?

odd : asking for only one countif at a time ( e.g. , =countif ( $ c $ 8 : $ c $ 105 , '' f '' ) and/or =countif ( $ c $ 8 : $ c $ 105 , '' m '' ) both work accurately on the same copied data .
hi @ davidschwartz i just updated my answer with the result .
i did a sfc.exe . it is popping up randomly .

, i checked via device manager and it says com1 . what other port i can try beside com1 . there is only one serial port in my mb and hyper terminal is showing that only
so how do i set up the network interface between all the 3 vms ?
i do n't care about hiding it inside the lan . i 'm actually taking about the wireless router 's mac . ca n't isps for example read mac addresses and trace traffic for example ?

no , the problem occurs with folders in my onedrive ( camera roll as well as self-created album folders ) . nothing special about them .
yes , quite frequently - it means that it bothers me a lot.. but 'rarely ' enough that i can not test if the problem is still present just like this.. sometimes it happens twice in 10 minutes other times it does n't happen for a few hours . touchpad being too sensitive ? maybe but i think it 's some glitch in the software when it thinks there was a tap when there was n't .
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- - tried a different flash drive- no success . tried looking through event logs- nothing strange . however , when the computer starts up after attempting to encrypt the drive i will get a pop up that says the decryption key could not be found . this may be because the key is stored on a flash drive that i have to unplug to get my laptop to start .
i am trying to develop on my local host but it keeps redirecting me to my live domain . i thought adding the ! ^127.0.0.1 condition would stop that from happening .

i 'd prefer not to , has given me headaches in the past and i 've gone through a lot of trouble getting the dual boot system working correctly so using wine with my nice fresh windows install only a partition away seems like a step in the wrong direction ! but it may be the only option for what i want to achieve .

each of the four routers is placed in each meeting room , and have one long lan wire running out from each of them , connecting to a central 8-port ethernet hub . each router is configured to broadcast 2 ssids : `` office_main '' `` office_guest '' and each ssid is configured to distribute `` 208.xxx '' ips and `` 218.xxx '' ips respectively ( all the routers were also linked using a fancy wifi feature ) . all clients are isolated in the wifi access points , access to the internet is prohibited except for the proxy server . the servers are directly connected to the lan , which has unrestricted access over the net .
both are connected to lan
thank you for your reply . it does , but sometimes it is not convenient enough . i was hoping to find a way to browse one 's files and folders and add the relevant files to an already open message windows as one goes . all the other file attaching methods are fine too , but sometimes it is just simpler and more productive to add multiple files from different locations in a click of button as you browse . i 've researched the topic a little , and it seems that currently it is not possible to do that , at least not in any built in way .

right-click , `` open with , '' choose program , audacity.exe , `` always use this program to open this type of file '' . that may not be the perfect phrasing -- i 'm at work and on a mac at the moment , so i ca n't check all the prompts in win7 .
thank you for your concern . i think the problem may result from a deprecated entry in `ldb` databases in sambe . i 've updated my question .
appreciate the responses , thanks . downtheall , does indeed have an export function , but it does n't export all its data . in the end i found the easiest approach was the track down its sqlite datastore and just interrogate it myself . turned out to be fairly straightforward once i got comfortable decoding the json data format it uses to put all the data in one field ( rather than have individual fields in the db ) . thanks again .
router 1 is an adsl modem & router 2 is a plain ethernet router that takes an ethernet cable in it 's wan port .

yes , i wiped my ssd and reinstalled windows a month and a half ago after i had to replace my cpu . it has been activated , and this is the first time i have seen the message .
right now i 'm seeing it for a .docx , but other .docx 's open normally . in fact , more playing with it has revealed that even *the same* docx does n't have the problem if i make a copy of it . no apparent differences with getfileinfo . weird .
affects all browsers ( chrome 2 , firefox 3.5 and ie8 ) .
i doubt that . let me double check anyway .
, thanks . i did search before posting but did not turn up that information ; guess i used sub-optimal phrases .
the pc is remote from me ( the superuser account holder ) and obviously has no internet . i have a picture of the screen . i can post that , i guess , soon . in the meantime , what are you looking for ?
i get `` ca n't find language dll msain900.dll '' in an alert box when i try to run access ( both when opening an existing database and when just running it ) and in any mode ( regular and safe mode ) .
i 'm sorry , windows 7 x64 . updated question .
i want to know if there are any podcasts that covered the topic that i am working on . so are there any episodes in any podcasts that covered the topic that i am researching on . i am hoping to know people who are talking or working on this topic as well as what they say . i am not trying to search within the audio , just the episode topics and other descriptions .
i do n't have access to the windows 7 computer , it 's password protected . i can only access router .
you are probably correct , mark . thus i acquiesce .
it 's of type pop .
it just gives a prompt/command line console after i log in .
look guys , this is a little different than the one already posted . i would not have posted it otherwise . i 've tried those solutions as i said . the difference is , as stated , is that for some reason , nothing downloads from m $ to my laptop . telling me this is a duplicate question is not helping .
: yes . i 'm playing the same media from windows and linux ( and it works in windows ) . the question is still justified : )
and31415 : no . the point is n't to prevent ie only , it 's to block internet . a few users have installed ff or chrome , and i do n't really mind . but the internet-blocked users do not have install capability to put alternatives on . because group policy can specify disallowed programs per-user , i 've used this to block ie , and therefore internet , access on a per user , per session basis .
actually , i do n't recall removing the encryption , perhaps i did instead of pausing it . i did make a mistake the 1st time i reflashed my uefi , when i did not pause it , but since then , i believe it had been up and running , fine , and i did a pause and reflashed the uefi again , as i have a asrock z170m-itx/ac newer mb , they seem to update the uefi often , ... ... ... anyway , the problem now is that i get this `` whether or you want to encrypt all or part of the drive '' and i 'm not sure how to proceed ;
thanks christian for fixing that table . @ gtwebb no i just layed it out this way to make sure i did n't miss a drawing . i had n't thought through how i would summarize the data at the start and just thought i might be able to do it with the way i described . i 'm almost done the `` dirty '' method just using =sumproduct ( ) on each sheet and listing the shapes , but alas no cut list this way .
the original image is free of jpg artifacts , while the image windows creates is full of them . i would like to get rid of them without resizing every single image on my computer .
i 'm not any more but at the time of the question it was to easily edit the hosts file ( something i do n't need to touch as often now )
explanation , but a solution would give some insight on what is going on .
yep i 'm on that , just thought that i would give this place a go first . just in case someone knew how to solve it .
yes , @ jakuje the server node ip address is a public one
when i use the filter function in the event log to view last shutdown ( 6008 ) , there 's a string of errors for every single time i 've had to hold the power button down to shut the unit off going back to the day i did the ssd/window 10 upgrade . it says : error 6/29/2016 3:23:08 pm eventlog ( event id ) 6008 ( task category ) none . in the notes it says : the previous system shutdown at 3:21:44 pm on 6/29/2016 was unexpected . any suggestions ? what other event id codes do i look for ? thank you .

i want the ease of use of freenas , but i also need to run at least 1 other vm as a web server , and a couple of vm 's as devel environments .
it happens occasionally , on and off , with no changes to what is installed on the computer . being that i am editing a document on a sharepoint server , i suspect that it is network related . other software and computer in general works fine . the problem goes away ( and returns ) on its own .

also , i kind need to be able to decrypt the file on ( ubuntu ) linux . i tried `enigma`/`crypt` on freebsd , and then when i copy the file to linux , `crypt` can not decrypt it .
it 's set up like a standard router right now , nothing fancy . he has `ath0` with his ssid , i have `ath1` with my ssid , i have the wired ports . both use dhcp . i have n't touched anything advanced in the router except for attempting to set this up ( the screenshot in the question ) , but those changes were reverted .
the laptop connects to the internet wireless-ly . it plugs into a charger which goes directly into a plug socket . it does not use a powerline adaptor . the powerline adaptors are both plugged directly into wall sockets with no power surge protectors . i have tried these in multiple sockets as well as the laptop charger .
how can i do that ?
it can , but the results are really flaky in ubuntu 14.04. facebook and other https heavy sites fail

no , i 'm sure that i used to start a private session inside the currently opened window . anyway , i 'm not sure on which version i was using at the moment .
the script is irrelevant ( and , it works in every other situation ) - i am just running `vboxmanage controlvm [ vm ] savestate` and `vboxmanage startvm [ vm ] -- type headless` - the only way the script itself would be relevant is if there is some difference in the way it is executed at startup vs after login .

: yes it is . i can use the same account/password to log in and for the uac popup
/abspath/ is just meant to indicate that i used an absolute path to a folder there as is required by `ssh-keygen`

i do not have enough portable storage for backup , hence in a clean install i will only format the os partition .
i sent you a reply about that already . for me it does not actually matter if it 's in single or dual channel , i just need 8gb of ram in my mobo . to be able to install 8gb of ram i would have to use all 4 dimm slots ( x2gb modules )
actually , the doc file is really old , that i need to convert to cdr and edit , i 'm not starting from scratch here .
yes , turned it off .
i tried running the following command to check : `` netstat -anp | grep 3306 '' , however it returned nothing , which i think means that there are n't anything else trying to run on that port .

i just updated the main post . i will check the psu model and everything because i 'm not sure . in my computer i have 1 ssd , 1 hdd , 1 dvdram , would disconnecting the dvdram do something ? or since i do n't use it it does n't waste any power ?

i honestly have no idea - i just found it one day in a house i recently moved into !
it 's a generic laptop . i bought it without os . here 's the link :
word 2010. i basically went through and did the brute force method , making it easier on myself by creating a template and then modifying the style template and using a `` save as '' type of mechanism for each numbering style i needed .
, nothing really special about adapter . it 's tp-link wn422g . and everything was working perfectly some time ago . i did n't update drivers or something .
i just found a weird solution.. may be its logical . that my host file missing localhost -- > 127.0.0.1 entry under /system32/dirvers/etc/host .. when i did that and restarted . it worked
2.6.30.10-105.2.23.fc11.i686.pae -- i guess rebooting is n't such a big deal , but i loathe it . of course , we have thunderstorms forecast for the next 4 days , so this problem may just take care of itself ...
we have outlook 2010 , and i was thinking a distribution list might suffice . the issue is how to look into archived discussions ?
thanks , but it`s still the same .
what do you mean ?

which one are you specifically referring to ?
do you mean when i visit the website , or i should put my public ip in the virtual server setup ?
root user in phpmyadmin . `` copy user '' .
i think that because one has a solid yellow wire and the other is yellow with a black stripe . i just assumed that those two would be different . i checked both . it 's just an assumption but i do n't know how i should handle this .

racing121 : no , there is no driver for any of my mice . psychogeek : i discovered where the mouse is enumerated , it 's in the `` user interface devices '' ( translation from french ) . i got two drivers listed : `` usb entry device '' and `` hid-compliant device '' . and nothing is enumerated in the pointing device list excepted the touch pad . i 'm not able to reinstall the usb 3.0 drivers . i got the message `` the asmedia usb host controller was not found '' . i changed a couple of parameters in the bios to enable usb 3.0 but it did n't work ...
i do n't think so if only because i use it as a download server , dropbox server , etc . it 's connected to the net and doing things pretty much all day but it only seems to crash when i 'm streaming hd video content . over ethernet , i should say .
linux ( debian ) yeah . i only wanted to allow specific block , since that vpn is slow .
: recommended for handling user / group permissions consistently and easily . i do n't really want to get into acls . there was the `` original '' setup - , group `` users '' , other - and user private groups - , , others with sgid set . apparently , they are both no longer `` en vogue '' . so , is there some guideline on how to handle things , or is it all `` ad hoc '' now ?
hi dave , gpu does not require 6-pin ( or any other ) power , just pci-e. iirc the psu is 500w , which by my calculations should be more than sufficient . it was a cheap psu though . i 've been doing more googling and it looks like someone was having similar issues that were resolved by fiddling with amd 's cool n quiet setting in the bios and the windows power plan , so that will be my first point of call when i can get back in front of the computer .
thanks for your help , only 5 if it does n't work . @ ramhound , it was assumed correctly that i am running a 64-bit os , and there appears to be a driver .

well , given the year when i used slackware , it is quite possible that i used apm ( maybe together with acpi , if that 's possible ) . i believe that what i 'm describing here is a bug that nobody cares to fix ( maybe because it affects too few people ? ) .

indeed , that works ( e.g . 5001 ) . however , the reason why i want 500 is that it is used by ipsec and hence more likely not being blocked by restrictive ips . i do not have selinux installed . the permission argument is also untrue : i leave everything the same on the server ( i.e. , port 5001 ) , just change on the client to 500 and change my firewall to forward from 500 to 5001 ( instead of 5001 to 5001 ) . problem is there again .

since i think avoiding that assumption would complicate things a lot i 've decided to assume they 're independent . the function for the density surface is more what i 'm looking for and if i recall correctly i could use the solver from there to get particular points . does that sound right ?

both the cables go back to the cable box on the outside of the house where there is a 3 way splitter . one for my tv , one for one modem and one for the other modem . then a single cable goes back to the telephone pole behind my house .
yeah . that 's what i 'm choosing between - fixed port or selecting available port . for the port i need to drill a hole in router through upnp . so i 'm not sure how that gon na work if the port will change every server restart . it 's obviously more work for me but might work better .
**update : ** **the emphasis is on the ability of the os to boot quickly**.in contrast to this method involving a battery , hibernate loads memory images from hard disk which makes booting slow.i.e , in hibernation you have to load the memory images from hard-disk back to the ram where as in the method involving battery , since contents of the ram are preserved , becomes faster at booting . the question is about the **practicality of implementing such a backup source** , **the other components that may have to be considered** other than ram to provide backup etc..
yes , if possible i 'd like to avoid having to use an inverter which is usually pretty inefficient . many picos run directly off usb , perhaps this can be converted efficiently
the two are identical , however i literally just found a solution : )

thanks for the comment . i sent an email asking 18 different friends to try the link . 17 have replied so far . of those , 12 see the mskb article just fine , and 5 get the `` page not available '' message . what do you get ?

! [ windows 7 disk repair fail ] [ 2 ]
there 's nothing wrong with either of them . i can open and save files when i have the application open . there might be an issue with the registry ... other than that i 'm not too sure .
i 've seen it happen on another website before but i just ignored it . i assume they use the same character encoding .
wijsman . windows vista 64
i have not tried that since the problem started . i updated my question with some background info to explain why . i am assuming that this may have been the start of the problem ( how the computer got infected ) but is no longer relevant because inserting a blank , fresh from the package , thumb drive caused it . i took this to mean the issue is on the computer and only being triggered by inserting the drive .
. how do i develop something like this
edit : i found to be helpful in figuring out wanderlust .
i do n't know what to think now ... i 'll go and check them in support again ...
frank , thank you for your advice . i will do to unplug my pc when i leave my pc alone . i usually develop android application and search the information on internet so i must connect to my home network . regarding mfa , that 's true your thoughts how often is key . but i would like to have the solution to keep safe .
yes exactly : )
thanks for the suggestion . looks like all the permissions are there . updated op .
that does n't work , as this is a specific to the project . similar to dependencies or references .
yes i tried that and it still acts like it should not come off .
well , that is slightly different depending on whether it is my chrome notebook , or the laptop . basically it tries to find the server , tries , and tries -- and then times out and delivers the error : unable to connect to the server .
generally , yes . however for my scenario i have some contributing factors that uniquely tailor my search for the specific request . it may be that the output is one or the other , i typed each example from memory .
i thought about that.. but there 's a little light going on the power unit as well as the mb . does n't that rule out the power unit failure ?
it does n't show up in disk utility . and i ca n't use the repair tool .
no its not in boxes , instead its the plain ' ? ' character . confirmed .
: how do i post my ~/.bash_profile and ~/.profile ? i set things to /bin/bash instead of default login shell . no luck . hefewe1zen : looked at the article . when he says `` start with `` export path=/usr ... '' am i supposed to paste that into terminal as a command ? tried that . no luck . slhck : i ca n't remember what i was doing . it was ages ago . where do i find my .bash_profile ?
to read websites and pdf documents . white font on black is much easier to read , especially in night .
hi , $ destination has nothing to do with this issue ... it is a variable i have populated and the script works fine if i am prompted . this is rsync over ssh .
any hardware or router , preferably at the price of a small business kind of router .
i am trying to search in some path with wildcards in the path , not only in the file name , i need some way using existing windows tools ( cmd.exe ) , or powershell , or some external free tool !
i remoted in on it a long while back but do n't remember what i did exactly . i do not have control of the server
the problem seems to be with ambient light sensor . instead of adjusting the brightness to match the ambient light , it puts a cap on the max brightness to the level that it wants .

i do n't think the keyboard itself could be sending a signal to windows to turn this setting on , and it seems to be behaving normally otherwise . it 's definitely not a flaw in the keyboard itself : the setting in windows gets turned on , and turning off the setting fixes the problem . it 's just aggravating to keep having to do that .
to clarify , i use overlay mode due to the amount of calendars , and currently it looks like this : [ ! [ outlook calender , overlay mode , identical entries by different persons ] [ 1 ] ] [ 1 ] as you can see , some entries such as the brown and green one at the bottom left are identical except for being in two different ( persons ' ) calendars . i 'd like these entries to show up merged into one item ( e.g . only a green box with a brown border , or half green , half brown , or even only one color but with other entries from only green still showing up ) to decrease clutter . [ 1 ] :
the boot device priority is written in the question : `` so i configured bios to keep only the hard-drive '' . bios default do n't works better ( usb devices , then dvd , then hdd ) .
its crashed 3 times since i have had it , before installing anything at all . dev studio 2010 keeps barfing as well .
: although i 've since moved on from this problem by going through a reformat instead ( due to not finding an answer ) , it should be noted that faronics did not provide me with support . i had purchased the laptop along with the software installed from another party over the internet . faronics advised me that the software license was non-transferrable . the most they could do was tell me that a solution *does* exist , but that 's about it .
yes . booting with x pressed does not change anything : it stops at the spinning wheel point .
# answer ** @ akira** did a great job with the regex supplied in his answer . i went out on my own to find a way to put this into a reusable function and this is what i came up with : ( inside your vimrc ) define a function that allows you to pass a string to replace the matched string function findftp ( local ) execute ' : % s , href= '' ftp : //.*/\ ( .\+\ ) '' , href= '' '.a : local . '\1 '' , g' endfunction * ( optional ) * assign this function to a command so that you do n't have to use `call` command -nargs=1 findftp call findftp ( ) this would then be called with something like : findftp local/directory/
it 's not even loading the install screen of windows . previously it had installed windows 64-bit , which was installed when only 2gb of ram where in place .
yes , on the exact same computer , with the exact same hardware configuration . i 've also had server 2008 r2 as well , and i never had this kind of difficulty with initial updates
yes , it does when i directly connect it to a power source using the dedicated phone charger .
yes . but it says that it 's unmounted , and does n't appear in disk utility as mounted . it looks more like it 's a read-only filesystem .
dazslayer - i need to connect some sort of wireless ethernet bridge or access point to the tv and nas , however many of these require entering a home page to change which network they connect to , whereas i need one which connects to two wireless networks with the internet arriving over both . doc - pfsense needs to sit on a computer , whereas there is n't one in the loop . if i used it the devices would connect to the pc which would then route it to the correct internet network . i am really looking to buy a cheap stand alone box .
it does fit , but i wanted to know if it fitted specification wise
yes . i have a pc inventory software tool that uses the bios serial number to uniquely identify computers . it works fine for physical hardware and for vms from other vendors , but does n't know how to handle multiple virtualbox vms .
do you mean with yum reinstall zlib ? or do i have to do something like this :
edit : java version 7 u67 ( build 1.7.0_67-b01 ) just noticed the same problem for the 3d phone viewer on vodafone 's website .
went ahead and installed sp1 from mu and rebooted the system . per programs and features , there was no change to the version . still listed as 15.0.4569.1506. reran mu and the sp1 entry is no longer listed as a viable update needing to be installed . do n't see anything in the component about menu referencing sp1 though . oddly enough , it references a different version number though 15.0.4569.1504 mso ( 15.0.4701.1000 ) ... .i believe this was the same version number prior to the me downloading/installing sp1 as well .
- i see the star , so apparently that 's not it .
look at my screenshot though - the modified memory is *huge* . and i only have chrome open with two tabs , skype , pidgin , a word document open , and steam . that 's it . i should n't be getting `` out of memory '' errors on 16gb of ram with this setup ! no broadcom wifi sadly .
the reason is a bit esoteric : my coworkers do not work in a virtual machine , and we 're working on code that connects to something running on our own machines . i 'd like not to have to keep an out-of-sync modification of the code to make it connect to my host pc through the network .
do you think with vd can i solve this problem easy ? if it counts i 'm using linux .
. thanks for your reply . i 'm using `windows 7 enterprise` .
. when i create a virtual hard disk in windows 7 using truecrypt 6.3a ( support windows 7 )

, yes , i know static html is ridiculously fast , but you 've completely missed the point that drupal does an incredible amount of work in less than half a second , but i 'm getting 3+ minute load times .
- there was a typo at step 2 : replace id with key
yes , it 's cold in the room with the computer . no central heating means rooms close to the outside walls get *very* cold .
have n't done any configurations on the network , i do n't have access at this time . i am wanting to know if , when you set up the network , do you have to `` commit '' a certain amount of bandwith to each side of the network ? can this be changed ? it seems like we have great connection on the locked side , but is wire connection not wifi . is the connection type the difference in speed ? or is this a difference in committed bandwith to each side ?
yep , latest everything
no , it is over http in all cases ( on my computer and on the ones where it is fast ) .
the file does not seem to be saved anywhere , i am not prompted for a save location so i assume it would be normally saved in documents
nope . this is strange , because in all applications it`s working properly . i have two keyboards ( notebook and wireless ) . e.g . i type 2 , and textbox show me 22 or 222 .
the last picture is the same folder , i 'm just showing you all of the permissions for that folder . so it has plenty of permissions all with full control . the individual files/folders inside the folder that i have shared ( that i can not access ) all have the same permissions as the main folder . the last *two* pictures are the same folder just from the simple view and the advanced view to make it clear that it has permissions set .
thank you jozzas for your comment but i do n't want to use any virtual machine . without that is there anyway ? and ca n't understand why some one gave me -1 for this valid question..can that person clarify me please ?
**edit** i am not aware of any recent changes ( i do n't think i installed new software in past few weeks ) . also i do n't use dvd drive much so i am actually not sure how long i have this problem . only program which comes to my mind is `daemon tools` which i have installed like half a year ago but it could be root of my problem . my dvd-rom is `matshita dvd-ram uj8a2asw` and motherboard is `asustek u46sv` .
i was going to include the info.plist in this but it 's way too long heres a link : ? download

( sometimes i want to answer one issue from an email and leave some more for answering . )
they 're constants .
it is a linux specific question which now that there is a se site for linux it would be the natural place that someone asking this question would go . if the question was regarding the distinction between text and html in email rather than about a `` linux command '' then it would be better located here .
the full command i used is `find /usr/local/share/locale -exec stat -f ' % p % n ' { } \ ; ` . `stat` is `/usr/bin/stat` . this is on os x mountain lion ; are you on linux ?
well , it 's a qnap turbo nas . i did a quick search and could n't find the exact web server type , but since it runs on an intel atom 1.8ghz processor , it must be able to handle apache . the thing is that i do n't think i have easy access to these config files , except for the php.ini file , which i think is a bit useless for this .
in the normal operation . not for the bootop or windows loads .
ok , 32 bit version is connecting ! i know that vpn tunnels ( especially foreign ones ) is common to slow down your internet speeds . i have 50mb/s download and frootvpn claims they have lots of 10gbit servers and when i connect i usually get 1 to 2 mb/s down with 200ms ping . are there any settings in my router that could be slowing it down any ? i want to squeeze as much as i can out of it .
, i have a dynamic ip address and no i 'm not behind a router ( just using a wireless modem )
it is a default line chart .
command line in shell and google 's query box are both a command line to me
it graphs but the problem is it does n't show anything from the data . the scatterplot shows boxes in every space and that 's about it . is there a better way in excel to visualize this data ?
: it is n't , but it could be worth writing the basics down anyway . i for one would upvote it . if other people are searching the same thing , for them it may be an option to switch the hypervisor .
my mobo is asus m3a78 pro my rams is corsair gaming memory 2gig each
i 'm not sure . i can check . would this be an issue ?
nope , that 's really weird ...
for example i would like to be able to monitor two-way radio channels , or perhaps transmit audio to baby monitors or on unused fm radio frequencies . oh , and in case you 're wondering i do n't really have a particular reason for wanting to do this . i just think it would be a really fun project .
what i meant there was , i asked the same question in microsoft community as well . and reply by microsoft is that `` if i create a recover disk with windows 10 pro upgraded '' the recovery will install windows 10 pro not windows 10 home as the default os .
yes , i tested it with 2 different micophones
hmm , i do n't have that entry , only some `` size '' or `` enable '' stuff

i 've tried to contact asrock support but have n't heard from them yet and do n't expect them to be all that helpful . does anyone have a better idea what it might be ?
gotcha . yea , i tried clearing ie 's cache and that seems to clear the ftp cache . so at this point i 'm hoping for a way to separate the two , and if not , a `` plan b '' is to disable ie 's cache altogether i suppose .
edit : for instance if i 'm logged in on superuser , stackoverflow , facebook and yahoo , is there a way to see all this in a list ?
i dont think you actually can select multiple calendars at once . ctrl clicking a second calendar just focuses on the second one .
: yes , that 's true . that 's what i have mentioned in my answer too . and that is exactly what i 'm going to do .

basically , can i mount orangefs as non-root ?
yes , i will add each user manually .
the current os 's are mostly windows 7-10 and 2 macs . if i can use a windows solution , that 'll be fine though . currently we do not run any servers , but i believe i could get the parts to set one up . each user has only one google account but there are 20+ users .
i updated my question .

/e /r:2 /w:2 /ts /fp /log /tee /eta . i know the files have n't been changed since robocopy has been run . they are a historical record of some previously completed work which no one would be using currently
no , i have connected it to the laptop without the kvm and the problem persists .
edit : right now i 'm using the autoexec macro to navigateto > minimizewindow and then a button click to toggle between navigateto > windowmaximize and > windowminimize ( syntax may be off a bit , i do n't have it open currently ) . i 'd prefer to hide/unhide to minimize the likelihood of accidental changes-it would take a conscious effort to open the pane-not just random navigation by an inexperienced user . fwiw , this is more about accessibility to it and not really a security issue .

i know i could figure out how to do it myself , but until today i did n't think i had enough hardware ( most of my sata ports are taken up by a raid 10 array , and i have no other machines other than laptops ) . but thanks for the downvote , i 'll take it if it helps me find expert advice .
it does n't matter where the computer is . docked , not docked , on the battery or not .

no , i want to enable computer icon in desktop icons in windows 8
this is a sample output i get when i run it : '' updating registry values , please wait ... '' the operation completed successfully . the operation completed successfully . the syntax of the command is incorrect . as you see the last line complains about another command but not sure why it 's trying to run another one ... ..this happens when i run it using just one registry path . with one it seems to work properly , even with that last error massage there . i 'm playing with pausing `` ping 1.1.1.1 -n 5 > null '' to see maybe it 's doing too fast that it fails .

update : the below are the replies to holiness david 's questions . 1. the hard drive is somewhere 30 % to 40 % full . 2. i have 4gb of ram . 3. this laptop was just bought recently . 4. as mentioned above , this laptop was bought recently so the hdd should n't be very fragmented . 5. i was certain my av was n't scanning the hdd .
g. : because i want to `` plug '' my pc on laptop as virtual domain using windows /etc/hosts , and this method do n't allow use no-ip address . and i want to http server on my pc be accessible on laptop , so i need to use ssh with no-ip address to make server from my pc to looks like localhost . but i already done that , ssh -l 8080 : localhost:80 my.no-ip.org , so thank you for your help : )
i did n't even know there was a tool called `sgdisk` , but i will check that out now . thanks : )
i did n't think of using another device as the dhcp provider . the isp-supplied router has options for disabling dhcp on the lan ( although does not supply any interface for changing the dns servers even when dhcp is switched off ) . in this case however i think it wo n't work . the wireless device has hardcoded dns ips ( ignoring ones from dhcp ) , so whilst this would work for other devices , that device would still use its hardcoded dns ips .
both computers get completely different connections to the internet ( with different gateway ips but same dns ips ) . one of the computers gets the ip 190.44.167.xxx and the other 190.46.167.xxx
update : i got reply from seller and the person said : sorry to hear that the screen does not work , it was working in my eeepc 901 ( windows xp ) . i have googled the problem and it may be a bios compatibility issue . however i wonder if you have tried the brightness keys or this link : if you have no luck let me know .
at this time is a `` hybrid '' using .
i upgraded using anytime upgrade & forgot to back-up the key ( it did n't cost much , so i 'm not much out of pocket here ) .
how do i make it so microsoft edge is not the browser that opens when links in windows live mail and word are clicked ?
yes it did ! thanks !
# # # edit 1 : changing fonts does n't really help as everything else does n't look the way it should . # # # edit 2 : the monitor is buzzing on 2560x1440 so badly in case there are lots of lines on the screen , like file listing . if i type `ls /usr/bin` it makes such nasty irritating sound . when resolution goes to 1920x1080 it 's a bit better . any idea why ?
my situation , home os - windows want - an image file that can be executed in a virtual machine ( vmplayer or virtualbox ) or booted directly on my home pc .
not so familiar with this stuff . what do you mean by the kind of monitor ? the laptop i 'm using is a dell studio xps .
i made it a community wiki .
: no .
the server is connected to an ethernet switch , and then that is connected to the gsm modem . the modem is a digi transport wr21 , i 'm not sure what the switch is .
: check if the machine is alive and `` in range '' in the network .
- what is vba ?
i just wait the disk access light off to shut down the computer by the button .
yes , it does not . if you add a link and then send an email it remains in plain text in the recipient 's email client .
the disk is properly listed in bios . the 5th disk is identical also - st3000dm001 . i can see no difference between 5th and 6th in bios .
: i ca n't be sure . i think i 've burn cdrs there successfully before ; not sure about dvds .
no.i know i ca n't boot from the usb . i want to install it onto a partition and the way to do that us by starting up the computer with the usb in it . however my computer seemingly disregards the usb and just boots to xp .
windows 8 is on virtual machine with bridged network adapter ( virtual box ) . auto assigned ip - ip of my host machine , where my server hosted . i know , this is not good for alltime , but good enough for testing purposes . i'am think this is not routing trouble . ping ca n't resolve name to ip .
, no , we use ip address directly . a send its ip to web server on internet . b access web server to get a 's ip .
if any answer might not work in both environments , please indicate which environment it is for .
192.168.1.1 is the default
dhcp is no more working , so every day i have to select an ip not already taken .
edit : the os is osx el capitan ( sorry , i forgot the most important info )
yessir , i very much did .
there is n't any error message . the code runs perfectly well . it 's just that it uses the cpu when it 's actually supposed to use the gpu for the new user .
yes , i 've opened port 8080 and then forwarded port 8080 to the ip address ( .133 ) with port 80
i do n't have any access to the fileserver , can not change/add software or services . i ca n't add sharepoint etc to it . i can only run a script/app on my client to 'document ' existing folders when i mount the fileshare or create new project folders on it .
: yes , by merge i mean join them seamlessly in sequence . we can take as granted , that all files share the same framerate , codec and resolution . used codec is mainly following the mpeg-4 standard such as xvid . in fact it is possible as it was before lion as well as it is with windows . i 'm looking for a tool that also runs on lion .
nope . i have to write my reports in msword . a free add-on would be acceptable too , but i am curious : is it impossible to do this with word without any third-party app ? then it is a shame , is n't it ?
this is a ( very ) remote server in an awkwardly placed rack , but i 'm trying to get someone to do just this . the other option is that the onboard audio is disabled in the bios , but i built this server a couple of years back and would n't have intentionally done that .
no i am not able to ping any website.i am only able to ping this address 192.168.1.1
nope . however , i also found out that google is deprecating the google earth plugin at the end of 2015 ( which completely kills the reason i was trying to use it ... . : (

basically i want to encode a video as lossless as possible without having gigantic file size like using `-qp 0` or `-crf 0` .
it is indeed old , and a solution not involving third-party software would be preferable . how can
nope . in fact i even connected directly to the modem using pppoe and the problem persists .
why downvote ? the question is legit , no ?
: sorry no its not hence my question . : )
no , but are n't there ways to directly access the device ? if so , could n't a userspace implementation in the malware suffice ? also , you can actually install drivers for ext4 , which is what i *was* doing , until i realize that the quality of those drivers was suboptimal and the user experience was not transparent ( the program always had to reside in the userspace actually ) . some implementations even had glaring feature omissions such as no write support or were unsafe and experimental .
re subnets . i get you - i read some of the subnetting stuff but it was a bit messy for a noob ( i 'm a software guy rather than hardware )
the value in the cell changes .
well it 's good to be because i need to install windows in nearest future and i wanted to have those files shared . so i would have both os on ssd and all data on hdd . if it 's possible of course .
: yes , this is the only screen .
nope , pretty certain it 's not that because it happens a lot of the time - and sometimes we have to tell them to send it into a different format ( e.g . word doc ) @ afh
nope , if i add it , it says there is no such file or directory .
because i started at a new company that uses lotus notes/domino

**edit** : the problem is that i need to remove the first space only as some text contain spaces as you can see below : 3.15chichewa 3.16chimane 3.17cinghalais 3.18crole de guine-bissau
well , it could be a .vbs , i do n't mind . the point is to execute something .
a new excel file would be easier
yes . both are plugged into separate routers .
no , just one monitor . i reboot every other day or so . as for why i turn the monitor off - no reason really , the power settings are set to stay on always , never sleep and i 've never bothered to change it . its been that way for months though and never caused a problem .
yes . it says `` total memory : 4096 mb ''
connection is not yet available .
it is after loading drivers but before welcome screen . tweaking bios settings did not help . in **boot.ini** i created 2 entries for loading windows xp with /bootlog switcher and another without . so , i could get boot log on complete loading and until the messagebox ( by hard restart on messagebox and choosing the next booting without bootlog in order to avoid its overwriting ) . though the last record on hard restart is always different one .
for sure , but how ? already tried with hh : mm , but it is clock time ( entering 26:00 changes to 02:00 )
long time for windows to shutdown ? ] ( ) end of automatically inserted texta
no , i run in an interactive mode . what i expect is that on the 1st page i have , let say , 10 processes , on 2nd page i have next 10 processes , on 3rd i have 4 processes and nothing more . what i get is that on each page i have some set of processes that i saw on other pages , what makes little sense for me
nope .
hi zain if i use sudo fdisk -l as local user them it is asking me password for same user and not root password . then were is sercutity for server if a user can access fdisk /dev/sda and create a partion or delete partion .
it would give a huge list of information , which would be like arabic for a newbie , i have listed the most basic commands
i have mid 2012 mac book pro - but that problem is not only for me - it is for everyone ( hundreds of pc 's and laptops ) . ok , maybe it was a glitch , that i had ok ping when i tested at first . now it is also high with mac . but the thing - 35 ping with router .
i attempted to ping `10.0.0.28` , with no success at first . however , after i rebooted , everything ( icmp ping , ssh , smb , etc . ) worked . i do n't know what happened , but i 'm writing it off as an intermittent glitch for now .
no , that 's the funny thing , i used to have another usb drive , like , 2gb , ca n't remember the name , and it worked fine . the usb i 'm talking about right now is the kingston dt 100 g2 16 gb .
thanks for pointing out the glaring omission !
yes , i access it from the same box . ipv6 was also my suspect , so i 've tried disabling ipv6 through registry ( services/tscpip6/parameters , disabledcomponents key ) and through network adapter settings , but it does n't help .
, @ dennis : i agree this is an ugly way to get the sub directories path from /home/local_directories/onedir
hinzufugen = 'add ' , abbrechen = 'cancel ' , not sure about 'farfegnugen '
yes ( *nix ) , i will update the question
the readme instructs me to open a bash shell , cd to where i extracted the zip and : `type `` ./configure '' , then `` make '' , then `` make install '' .` bash claims there 's `no such file or directory` , and
you guys are right , i thought `alias` was only to navigate with `cd` in front.. do you want to post the answer ?
it has a static address for both ethernet ports .
i tried net stop but i got `` the requested control is not valid for this service `` the driver is a kernel mode driver which is loaded by a service so i can not uninstall it from device manager . any ideas how to unload the driver ? thank you .
oddly , a half hour after posted this , and having the server up and running normally , i tried again and it worked just fine . i had tried several times before posting . so , intermittent is a big issue , but not an immediate problem . if i can understand why it happened , then , perhaps i can deal with it more wisely in the future . i do n't know what smc is . another thing i must learn , i guess .
i have tried installing using both yum and rpm . same issue comes
aim and msn , yahoo and jabber would be nice but not required .
i 'm running a file server on my phone . apparently , i ca n't get my network up and running !
sorry for not being more specific . i 'm new to mac and using pixelmator . just pushing `` f '' within the program to go full screen.i thought there might be a always keep menubar on top setting somewhere i could n't find .
i did n't get you , why uac prompt will pop up for the user ? let 's say that the script & the program are stored in a local shared folder ( e.g . c : \shared_folder\ )
than a batch file
i would like to know when that specific part of the page is changed .
well there is no one os . i need to execute this on windows xp to 7 machines and windows server 2003 to 2008 machines . thats the best range i can give you .
no . says volume is empty .
the idea being that in the odd case i do n't want to `sudo` i should hit `^c` ? if i ca n't come up with anything better i might try that .
no internet connection , inability to access administration url , inability to reset to factory settings .
i wish . it 's a smart tv , and going through both the regular menu and the hospitality menu of the monster to try to find a setting , any setting , that might disable this 'feature ' has proven to be a futile task .
yes , the i5-4590 cpu works with asus h81i motherboard .
yes , `` i have monitored the traffic with wireshark to verify this . ''
nothing that i can think of . someone i know suggested a memory fault , but like i said windows showed no errors in a memory sweep
i do n't accept general statement about corruption . what is corrupted ? why it was corrupted ? how to fix ? the times of windows 95 when i was meeting with it 's install wizard each month , have gone . system should be fixeable by parts .
thanks , i did n't expect `-force` to help . strangely , if i start up 2 scripts , 1 always keeps in my tray while the other disappears correctly . comment either of the 2 out and it works . any idea how this happens ? refreshing the tray also does n't help . good tip though : )
i 've greatly simplified the example . the real thing would be too much of a mess with formula solutions . thanks for the suggestion below . i 'll try it out .
problem still exist in safe mode
, identify how ? they are different types , some of them are images , some mp3 files , some special files of the symbian os .
that 's a good suggestion , but then youtube etc can not work which is a problem .
i handed it back because of a hardware error .
restarting and all that jazz did n't change anything . pinging the ip 's of websites that i ca n't reach also gets me the same response as directly pinging them . what is interesting to note though is that when pinging sites that do n't work ( for example steam ) it 's pinging 69.36.241.237 , but when pinging google i ping 2a00:1450:4001:815 : :200e . now i 'm not an expert , but something seems wrong here , even though i have no idea what or why .
**edit** : following the feedback on comments suggesting to log my keypress'es during the weird behavior , i 've noticed it 's actually **f1** , **f2** , **f3** being spammed in an ordered sequence . clicking on them manually did n't stop them from repeating .
: i do n't recall performing any special configuration to that effect . how could i find out the answer to your question ?
such a newbee i do n't think i understand the distinction . i have a cable modem to which i 've connected the router . the computers and other devices on my network connect to the internet via hardwire to the router . as i mentioned previously , the ssid on my router is sierra . my wireless devices correctly show that network sierra is available and these devices connect to it . how would i determine if windows 7 is using wlan or ethernet ?
will it be enough to watch hd since the laptop can not play hd smoothly
good catch , it works well , thanks !
nothing in lsof or netstat .
nothing else crashes , only the window trying to load the files . the drive works fine on other computers . it even works fine when i open files in programs . it is specifically when i try to see them in file/windows explorer . a week ago this was not happening . huge pain because everything i need is on this external .
aiace is a sample computer name . file sharing is enabled . with the dialog above , only local users are visible ; other computer are not listed at all
big file downloads , video-streams , youtube , etc .
: this is windows 7 , 64-bit . hmm , it does n't work for me . can you upload the script you are testing with ?
josh , thanks for correcting my formatting . kaze - yes i do . they are for financial software ( essbase/peoplesoft ) . i need them in order to do my job .
no , i 'm not creating app at my own . ( the question is a little hyphotetical ) . i thought about fork before but , if i 'm thinking correctly , it can be used only in application code , that i have not .
i ca n't access it from inside or outside the network by ip
i cant recall if that was the case or not . if i had to guess , i would probably say : yes , it was mounted when i deleted it .
it 's the same case with `powershell` . but thank for mentioning `conemu` , did n't know about it .
can i connect
i dont understand your comment
yes , i did , flash the vbios , only solution for linux , afaik
there is no home page set in chrome . if i right-click any chrome taskbar shortcut and click new window it opens to a blank page . and if i use the original shortcut it opens to a blank page . how would i pin the .exe - i can only pin something that is already running . on startup is set to open the new tab page
ahh , yes , that did work . i did some research and discovered the problem is that i did n't have read-access to `private/var/log/system.log` . thank you !
yup ; it *can* load just fine once it gets past the excruciatingly slow driver loading .
could you please paste the link ?
superfetch was started . i did disabled it for now to see if it 's going to behave the same on the next days .
there are no external graphics only intel graphics . and also not showing just switch off ( no blue screen ) .
thanks for the suggestions , i actually tried 1004917 quite a while ago with the 2.5 ( ? ) version of vmware . tried again though and it still wo n't work . : )
i do n't understand excactly what you ask ? i have windows in every computer and all the computers are in the same workgroup . i do n't have windows server so i think i can not set domains in my lan ( i think : s )
amd phenom ii x4 945 processor x 4 4gb ram - do you want the motherboard details too ? iirc its an nvidia chipset - i have an ati graphics adapter
i do n't know how to see which line gives error ...
yes i try it but does not work
nope , i would like to see a placeholder because some images has functions like voting up and down etc ... firefox just shows `` alt '' attribute if present in the image tag .
i 've updated the question
computer is off .
ok , so is that method which i found on pctool.com which i 've listed above ( that `` slhck '' was so kind to bold the title of and add bullet points to each of the steps ) correct or incorrect ?
sorry , forgot to mention the power supply is also new . ran the memtest as well , nothing found .
well , the idea is that if i have two head phones i would want to be able to hear the same output on both of them without running multiple machines or applications on the same machine ...
edit : when i right click after logging in the screen goes static and fuzzy ( will post picture asap
the network is a subnet on my pc builded with virtualbox , all the hosts on the network are debian machines . one of them in promisc mode .
hi , the command i ran is psexec \\10.10.10.32 -u `` admin '' -p `` password '' -i -d c : \users\admin\desktop\batchfile\helloworld.bat when i took away the -d i realise that psexec got stuck while running the batch file . it just hangs there .
i 've since ran sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx to fix that dependency . i now see this error : [ 1419:1030/130517 : error : gl_surface_glx.cc ( 347 ) ] glx 1.3 or later is required
why this is happening and how i would fix it
idk but it is bothering me ... ..
yes , its a home-school assignment ! i can use any configuration i want.though the clients still need to be in different subnets .
edit : after following up on an answer , i discovered another odd thing about this file : the `` hidden '' check box under the file 's properties is grayed out . why would this be ?
ok i 'll ask that question : what would have likely made the interface go down ? now , there are dhcp client issues but that would not likely affect the loopback adapter , correct ?
oops , yeah you are right . i have tried running chkdsk for about 4 hours so far and it does not budge . it just hangs at 75 percent complete . ( 1 of 996 unindexed files recovered )
i forgot to mention , windows 7 .
i do , the db i am trying to gzip over is a gb though so i 'd like to not have to export , download , import if at all possible
it does not happen for cd ( i had n't noticed that this works correctly , sorry ) , but when typing plain names ( e.g . of an executable to run )
it is a new build . i installed win 8 rtm on a fresh ssd drive .
zirak - this is how silverstripe cms uses alert boxes for some of it 's debugging .
updated question . win 8.1 he - > win 10 he was about 3 months ago . win 10 he - > win 10 pro about 2 weeks ago .
yes , solved it , thanks . but why ? ( the -o option is n't necessary , but the rest is ) .
both adapters are for ( different ) asus eee pcs . the replacement is some years older than the broken one . the original one has model number ad82000 ( in : 100-240v ( 50-60hz ) 0.8a ; out : 19v 1.58a ) and the replacement exa0901xh ( in : 100-240v ( 50-60hz ) 1.0a ; out : 19v 2.1a ) . judging from the size i 'd say both of them are switched-mode power supplies . they seem to have only two contacts , so i guess no control circuit ! ?
added what i tried to the question 's body .
yeah i rectified my date settings .. i think this solved my issue . thanks . but can u tell me the reason as to why there was an error because of wrong date and time ?
on my local pc . right now i have to open each page manually and look for a text string . i know there a search engine bots that do something similar , so i was hoping for something an end-user could use .
, according to superuser.com : `` super user is a question and answer site for computer enthusiasts and power users . '' perhaps they have different rules to stack overflow ( [ where i am a long time user ] ( but the only requirement there is to have a question that has a definitive answer . personally i find questions that are filled with too much description are hard to decipher . instead i just got to the point . i do n't understand how downvoting and adding condescending comments contributes positively to this community , but whatever .
yes that is correct thomas , sorry for the confusion
romeo , thanks for the suggestion . i double-checked my /etc/hosts file and there is no cwb1.local entry . i should have been more clear in my original post - i originally had an entry in my /etc/hosts file , but then removed it because i had created a dns entry on my router .
no i care about my ip address not the hotmail/outlook server ip address . it helps me get a rough idea of where i was when i sent an email , at home , at work etc .
no , unfortunately not . i was able to get norton 's software removal tool to work and on the advice of a symantec agent , i deleted every key and value that had norton or symantec in the name or data field , effectively removing the product . unfortunately , this did not solve the problem .
the library i am using needs super user permissions
: no , i do n't have . @ akira : it would be probably solution to my problem , but i would also like to know if there is a way to capture a i.e . qt application with only one widget displaying opengl scene .
so i ran memtest on my computer and had 16 passes with zero errors . now i 'm thinking it 's unlikely to be the ram that 's faulty . i tried starting my hard drive on another computer and it still did n't work . but not only that when i tried another working hard drive in my unbootable pc , it also failed to boot . i 'm at a loss here . maybe i have a bad hard drive and a bad motherboard ?
hi @ journeymangeek , i am restricted by having to have an ergonomic keyboard and knowing the the 4000 works for me , ( not all do ) . unfortunately # mcalex i can not touch type ( although i am being forced to type from memeory of some key positions as several keys show only a faint grey outline ) .
i guess my logic behind it was to have use my two lan cards and have a full gigabit coming in and a full gigabit going out . if this is n't useful then i just may have some suggestions with my setup . my goal is to use as much bandwidth as possible without affecting the end user performance .
it was working in winxp . since i 've got win7 , it stopped working .
update : i found this `exiftool` which can read and display the metadata of both .xls and .xlsx excel files . it is available in major linux distribution repos .
it is definitely oneiric ( 10.11 ) .
, i have installed already .
magicandre1981/ not exactly unstable . last last year i installed win8.1 and few months after that my lcd stopped working , and i had to buy new one . since drivers on dell page go up to win7 , now i am afraid to install 8.1 or 10. maybe it is just coincidence or maybe graphic drivers have something with it./ moab/ i installed every driver from dell site ( vista x64 x86 , 7 x64 , x86 ) but no luck .
i like listening to music in the office , and sometimes the headphone wire gets unplugged accidentally . as a result , people around get disturbed . i want to avoid that .
yeah i m only interested in listening port . 'plant ' was easy to remember : p
because it 's much more efficient to use keyboard shortcuts than to constantly switch gears between the keyboard and mouse . this is not an uncommon preference/goal for software developers .

hi david . i have just read the tag but i do n't think i understand the problem . you do n't think my post is suited to superuser ? or you do n't think the android tag applies to my post ?
a command line
that 's helpful , thanks . if you add as an answer , i 'm happy to accept .
i can not find memory in the settings ... you mean nexus 7 settings right ? right now i 'm accessing the tablet using a mouse via otg cable
i save on a daily basis from the same _sites_ .. just not the same _pages_ .
no , just on the second monitor . like a powerpoint presenter view type of thing .
that of hdds , checking
it 's a home server domain .
the bios it a02
i tried also there but maybe here someone can help me .
yes that was intended ^^ . and thank you for answers .
the changes was done when i logged in to the router ip address 192.168.1.1 where i typed the default username and password .
no . other account does n't work too .
i do n't have access to the database , just the application 's front end . i have one instance of the application which works , one which does n't . i 'm trying to compare their configuration , and the only way i can do that is to output a dump of their configuration and compare them : (
i tried that already . i can make excel open it . then i switched it back and open office still wont open it . and as mentioned , i reinstalled open office .
i just like to see if i can use/manage my google calendar and contacts in emacs as part of an attempt to consolidate my work into one , free and open source , package .
they have the same subnet mask , 255.255.255.0. they have the same default gateway ( 192.168.1.1 ) . they are in the same 192.168.1.x subnet
it would n't ping and i got the same message with ssh . however , see my solution above ; something that i did n't find in any of the tutorials i found .
**edit** after some messing around , i determined that the pc boots up and runs fine if i remove the video board and use only the onboard graphics . i 'm going to pick up a multimeter this evening and test the psu . if that is fine , i guess it is the video card ( which thankfully , carries a two year warranty ) . also , there was no post beep because i had them turned off in the bios . : - )
the installation always stops and closes at ~20 % and then shows the box in the image above
, my own .
audacity is a nice tool to edit audio file though it is quite hard to use . thanks anyway !
if it was n't clear before , let me spell it out . i do n't have access to the source . it 's proprietary and the owner ( juniper ) has not released a 64-bit version . other people seem to have gotten it to work on 64-bit environments without issue however .
the ones available for download on the their site ( sillicon 's site )
nslookup does n't give me hostnames , but angry port scanner does . i 'm trying to figure out how to do this with nmap and/or command line tools .
no , i need this functionality for quickly rearranging windows , to look at underlying desktop or other windows .
my one is a silencer 910 watt not sure about his it 's an older model psu but it does run the graphics card
i do n't have xinitrc or xresources at $ home . xauthority seems to be generated automatically . . . moving it did n't help . : (
hi rovolter , i 'm using windows 7 enterprise
edit : the drive works on my very old desktop computer - running win 7 - but not on the new laptop edit 2 : i have now tried the drive tools option that cleans the registry , but it did n't work . i think it is because this laptop is brand new .
nope..i ca n't uninstall the 64bit java 6 that i have as default since it 's required for other things i 'm working on . tried hacking around the registry to change the version read by the installer but no luck .
i also guess the reason is disk full , do you know any converter that can convert hard disk interface to usb ?
no , i do a normal login with a w10 account . w8 computers do use novell but that 's not the case for me or any of the other pcs in the same room
argh ! you 're right guys , sorry about that . the same problem exists when using sudo though ; i will update my question .
programmatically - vba
are you using win7 ? i might have been different on vista or xp .
no , it also happend with a file . i did also have a game on the hdd but it got corrupted .
it is mbr . i have tried in in all usb ports on several win7 machines , it does n't show up at all . thanks for the help !
one to one copy of the drive ( using dd or something similar ) . it `` works '' as in everything seems to be working , but cloning a drive is n't proper ( ms wants you to sysprep ) . just wondering if there will be issues down the line possibly .
something like this works with individual files using sed , cat file | sed 's/ . *//g '
first , i was . then i uninstalled them and installed the ones from realtek , as i 've mentioned . the sound is still not working . also , prior to the windows re-install , the default drivers worked fine .
i ca n't answer that question , i 'm not familiar with how encryption works and the owner has n't a clue at all about anything . all i can tell you is that it is win7 on an ntfs partition and that the user profile was protected so that files ca n't be viewed by other users .
yeah , it would n't let me as not enough time had passed . will do so now .
yes . the issue was actually firewall of windows 7 computer . created a rule . thanks
yes but after update it was running and was activated and now do n't know what happened it is showing as not activated
there is an android app that claims to have device-device transfer speeds which are much faster than the underlying protocols allow for : > amazing transferring speed > 200 times bluetooth speed ! ( speed will be affected by the equipment & the surrounding ) . thoroughly defeat bluetooth/nfc/airdrop . better than all you know
confirmed : booting in safe mode does indeed make those glitches go away . definitely starting to look like a graphics thing ? safe mode only enables one of the two cards in a low resolution ...
please . i am doing this because i need to put such output files on my multi-rate video adaptive streamer server .
the traffic is low . i can not put a figure on it atm , but i do n't think it 's hitting any bandwidth limit set in the router .
i suppose that virtualbox would be an option . however the effort to move the existing virtual machines to run under virtualbox could be similar to moving them from virtualpc to hyper-v .
i 'm monitoring file transfer and access .
64 bit register = 8 bytes and 16 eb seems to point to the register only having 8 bit registers
shaw the users are not connecting in any way , they are just logged in automatically ( i.e . bypassing the password screen ) . i assume this is the same functionality that you get when you configure a physical pc with the option not to ask for password at startup . then when you switch on your pc you go all the way to the windows desktop . same happens now , but this is a vm - as my assumption goes ( since i do n't understand the internals of this autlogon tool/functionality ) .
nothing helpful . it has : show status , play/pause , stop , next , previous , next group , previous group , disconnect . no `` properties '' or `` auto hide '' or anything like that though .
i 'm going to look into it . thanks
yes , synaptics thinkpad ultranav driver for windows 10 ( 32-bit , 64-bit ) - thinkpad
i have tried the battery . @ scottchamberlain the laptop is a gateway ne56r41u .
that results in ` { ` ( which by the way , is also a key i type hundreds of times a day and is really annoying to press , especially since i 'm used to a us keyboard )

i have three private keys , but i tried completely removing all of them and this still takes this long .
that might be it actually - i have my cdrom drive set as my first boot device . i 'll try making the ssd the first boot device and see if that helps .
thanks , how do i manually draw it ? will corel draw trace it automatically in this situation ?
im going to try some disk tests and post here the results . thanks to all
that 's the root drive - it 's an ssd where / is mounted .
no , he 'll get a dialog saying the file ca n't be located .
i think i 'm going to remove this . the answer was extremely localized . it was solved but it was only by being on the phone with the vendor ( kind of their error )
because profile contain many user setting , so that we co n't want to change it . how to prevent domain dns query ?
van doorn : i wish to give a specification . it is about a procedure how to specify certain medical conditions . several of these need to be specified in the same way .
no it was the 9.10 , i have not updated that laptop . shortly after i wrote the question i happen to find the answer ...
, i only tried video dvd 's , which worked fine . i will try some data dvd ( in the evening when i have access to the box )
this is a self burned iso/disk if that matters . never heard of that being an issue before .
: yeap , they are
my computer has 8 gb of ram .
no i ca n't `` eject '' . the usb connector-like icon does not appear . i can disable in `device manager` .
the default is the soundblaster audigy fx
. my bios is definitely a uefi bios . the motherboard is a asrock z77e-itx ( see ) and i 've updated it to the latest bios
actually ( if i understand right ) bittorrent 's and ftp 's clients are listening on ephemeral port but i would like for server to listen on ephemeral port provided by os as long as server is up . so my questions is whether it is safe to do this as ephemeral ports are generally used by clients for short-lived transport protocols .
not exactly . readyboost uses a usb flash drive to add more memory to a computer . this uses a fast ssd hard drive to cache data read from the disk so that it can be read faster the next time . while both can potentially improve performance , they utilize different hardware and operate in different areas of the operating system .
i used hd tune and i 've sent it to the laptop service center to have it checked .
: it does n't have a ui . it 's not an app actually , i am using a program which takes in an english sentence and tells me what its semantic structure is . to do that it needs to load a large file , its database . i need to work with it interactively to run some experiments but there 's a 120 second startup time every time ( for every sentence ) that 's driving me crazy . if there 's no solution i guess i could change the code and put the user input in a while ( 1 ) loop , but it would 've been a pain if i did n't have source code .
the autosave option was not checked ( thanks corporate default ! ) where is the autorecovery directory ?
`ssh username @ ipaddress` also , the other way , with mosh , was just by opening the chrome app and typing in the username and password
w. fenton : there are multiple reasons , for example : remove some table fields we do n't use so they do n't clutter , rename table fields so they represent what they actually do , change the defaults for certain fields to accelerate insertions , add new tables to create many-to-many relashionships , add new fields to certain tables to add information that we need , etc , etc etc . why do you ask ?
i am using ubuntu . i want to merge using shell script or through terminal .
i store results ( aprox 7kb files ) on that card every 10 minutes for about 4 months ... i think it 's not that much + the files are piling on the card , so the card is n't overwrited at one space too often ... but i 'm not sure how much the card was used before i started to using it , so it is possible
that is n't on yet , just the 'scrolling lights ' at the bottom right , which keep stopping then moving etc .
thing is , i do n't have any mail server ... if i need to send emails from the apache2 server i usually use gmail as a relay to send my emails . ( i use ssmtp and `` mail '' to do the job . could you explain what eforwardx.registrar-servers.com is and how i could change it ? thanks so far !
i 'm sorry but the sevenforums link is also not what i want . i do not want to change the location of my music or downloads folder . when i launch explorer with win+e , the right pane shows 6 items ( circled in red ) . how can i add c : \workspace\projects as a 7th item ? how can i hide desktop as an item ?
: that 's one thing i thought of as well , but i have no idea how to check the power supply for faults . i 'm not very electro-technical minded . are there any easy methods for someone like me to check the power supply ?
actually idk , i guess , that he 's still working but something went wrong with firmware . i can easy enter to the bios boot menu and setting up something . to be honest i 've tried today some launches and for some reason one of it was successful , even with logging , but after 3 minutes it stood again .
i can not open internet options from the control panel . i have checked for malware . scanned with avg from a different computer and i also ran combofix
nothing gets pasted , i found this thread : but there was no solution . one lead i 'm following is that it has to do with ie 's security settings . this makes sense since it turns out i can paste from some websites ( e.g . superuser.com ) but not others .
apologies . should have specified it is the growth ( i.e . year on year units increase by 133 on average )

simple command , thanks
thanks , we have continuous data changes on the live server so we can not lose an hour of data changes , maybe a few minutes . the only other option we can see is to create the vm on hyperv and copy data across manually , but that will most definitely not be fun .

sorry for late reply , i am using transcend 4 gb usb . it does not have hardware switch and peter , i will do as you suggested and 'll come back asap .
the downvote should go to the company that does n't want any other backup software than the ms standard xp builtin solution - you ca n't blame me for that decision that unfortunately is out of my hands .

there 's no mention of this anywhere on the intranet . also , the purpose of setting up a vpn in the first place would be specifically to *allow* connections to such services , right ? ( btw i also tried running the ssh server on port 33567 , so it 's definitely not a port 22-specific block . )
how to copy the table ? can you show me the places where i need to make changes in the code , and what methods to use ? @ yorik
the `` this '' i would have to do every time is call them and get them to override the restriction . i was looking for a way to disassociate my product key from the old machine.i do n't plan on installing it a ton , but at least one more time when i get my external ssd .
i wanted to stop the program at a specific time so that test results were more controlled and reproducible . i have found a way around this now . i will kill the program only once manually , then test only the recovery code . all recovery attempts will start from the same point . i am testing how it recovers , not how it crashes after all : )

: if you copy your first response into an answer , i will grant you credit . rjt : i had a second video card and tested both video ports : no activity . i bounced the cmos battery ( per moab ) and removed the second video card . disconnected all cables and spent 15 minutes blowing out dust \ discharging capacitors . system is now working : thank you
i was doing some experiments about ip/spoofingtcp hijacking , so at the very begining , i have a third program disturbing the sequence number . anyway , packets exchange in this picture are between 2 normal tcp program . and i 'm just interested on how normal tcp stack react to inconsistent sequence number .
thank you everyone . @ scott , noted # 1. thanks . about # 2 , this is the order i am seeing . i do not know the reason . tail is always being executed at the end when i pass in second argument . i have tried many variations like passing a string with value `` null '' for slave_host and added condition to not ssh to it , if value is `` null '' . it starts tail only when ssh command is executed and starts tail after ssh , even though tail command is before ssh . about # 3 , updated my code to always use quotes .
it does until i restart the computer

**edit** after some testing it seems that this problem only arises from php 5.5.4 onwards . rolling back to 5.5.3 resolves the issue . **edit 2** the issue seems to be that `php5ts.dll` can not be read despite showing readable permissions . even when programs are `` run as administrator '' , the file can not be opened ( but can be deleted and renamed ) . the file can be opened if the extension is changed to something other than `dll` or `exe` , and other files in the same folder can be opened even if renamed to `php5ts.dll` ( replacing the original ) .

i 'm not sure how they 're connected to each other via the office network . i have two ethernet cables : one goes to my main machine , the other to my test machine . from my end , they have no explicit connection . it 's not possible to add networking/subnet details ; but they are on the same subnet , with the same gateway .
taken from the link : `i would use task scheduler to trigger the script on connection to a network , then use the script to confirm presence of the internet.` this is exactly what i wnat but , where 's this script ?
thanks for the heads up on that one . i 've not heard of 'read mode ' , so just googled it - it 's a word 2013 enhancement ? alas ... . i 'm on retro word 2010 , but yes , it sounds like what i 'm after . i do n't suppose there 's an equivalent in word 2010 ?
found batchmod at and it was an easy fix to my issue !
: yes , both computers are connected to a lan .
yeah , i just want the performance raid0 offers . i usually reinstall my system every couple months anyway . i do understand what raid is , i 'm only looking for performance .
any better ?

no , i deleted a folder *in the bookmarks bar* , not on disk . for something that important , you would think the application would warn the user that the data would be entirely deleted , not just cosmetically from the interface . besides chrome , only keeps a single .bak and the original is replaced after closing the browser .

well the two are interlinked as far as i 'm concerned , the machine does n't become unresponsive until the share is mounted , coinciding with high levels of traffic through the network card .

i can see the vob files on the dvd so i guess they were not decrypted even on the dvd . i used dvd smith , and i used ( to another destination directory ) , claddvd . does that make any difference to you ? btw . what would a dvd look like if you do dir on it or explore it , and it is encrypted ?
physically covered
what i actually have is a mess ( just a .docx document with all the correct formatting , but does n't use styles , and that i am loosely referring to as a `` template '' ) . i am working with people who are unfamiliar with styles and it will be difficult ( if not impossible ) to get them to use `normal-letter page` and `normal- main sections` and `normal - appendices` . just not going to happen . but i *might* be able to get them to click on `normal` , `heading 1` , `title` , etc .
i 'm not sure if it 's 2003 or 2007
yes i should have been like i said i never saw any of them screens where is say '' press del to enter bios '' it just loaded straight to win8.1 login screen but i took your suggestion about removing the cmos and it helped so thank you very much : p
the report runs each time i open the spreadsheet . it looks like one additional line was added to the bottom . but sheet 2 should be updating along with it , no ?
yes , i can see non ad-hoc networks .
it happens on all of my spreadsheets . my hard drive was recently replaced and microsoft office 2013 was placed on it , so this is fairly new to me .
i want a system clean of windows gunk . i want to have may coding tools , which are on e : , back as they were , without losing settings & without having to spend hours reinstalling . i do n't see problems , so long as i have the chinese wall of partitioning between windows on c and the rest on e : , f : , etc . however , if you know of concrete problems , then please let me know . thanks
it appears that the calalarm app supports such a feature .
what do you mean ? i of course could n't type anything other than the first letter in a drop down box ? then i had to scroll through and point and click with mouse
edit : adding some more information . everything is on root partition , also /tmp , /var , even /usr/bin , /usr/sbin . on separate partition is only long running java application which is also writing the logs to the same partition . are there any problems which could occur and influence the application ?

i have tens of workers who may ask me for a such set ( a dual-monitor workstation lol ) if i allow one person to have a dual monitor workstation haha
i 'll check , as soon as i get there .
does not need to be windows , we have several ubuntu systems too ( and if necessary , i can consider installing something else ) . just needs to be accessed through a web browser and needs to be able to dial a modem and show the terminal .
yes i have in stalled windows 7 on it i have been usong this computer for about a month now i just happened to take my ssd out last night and put it back in today and it wont work
tried with hd sound in front jack , ac-97 ( and hd audio disabled on bios ) and even unconnected . i tried ubuntu on a usb stick with no joy ; same problem , with some crackling if i listened carefully with headphones . fair to assume hardware fault ?
there will be no zeros in either column 1 [ year ] or in column 5 [ amt 5 ] . however there can be zeros in other columns amt1 , 2 , 3. so essentially i need the last non zero value in column 5 .

i 'm using windows and does n't install linux . : (
unfortunately you are talking to a 65 yr old woman ... .if you tell me where to find the information you ask , i will provide it . i appreciate any help . thanks
no , other than that was the factory setup , i 've now gone to non raid and have installed windows 7 on the once hidden partition , not sure if i can still access the ssd or other partition yet , still loading alianware program apps
i get a menu that looks like its made in curses . i sadly can not show that since it has info on it that is sensitive .
i think that 's exactly what i need to do , yes .
hi ! i actually ca n't find a setting to do it , so i was thinking of manually cleaning toners and contacts , but i wanted someone to confirm that it 's the right thing to do
no it 's not : - (
no , its a home computer , no proxies . also this happened suddenly , did n't change any configuration or hardware.. : (
lots of hdd activity .
how do i check it ?
almost right : ) the webpage shows the string i put in the question , not the exact bin used by it .
no i used 'lftp ' . i do n't know if its supported in original ftp command
you are right . i meant os .
what sense should i rephrase ? i dont quite get it how should i rephrase it .
it is an all in one pc and the usb is on the monitor - all the other ports are covered by a plastic port cover that i can not access ( without damaging the thing ! ) .
because when it is doing essentially anything , it will climb into the 80-90s range .
yeah , but that way i can not deceive a person peeking . when i say 'peeking ' i mean looking into my system with my permission .
there is an audio input , but no output . i tried hooking my speakers up through the input , just to try it , but the sound still came out of the monitor 's built-in speakers .
not a program i can edit .
i definitely will regardless of people answering . just want to know if i have to bring something else to occupy my time . sorry for posting in infosec .
not the main one that contains os . just the other hard drives .

interesting , it appears that with oh-my-zsh there is a `` ssh-agent.plugin.zsh '' . i was not aware of it running each and every time the shell starts , but apparently it is . interestingly it only fires this ssh-add after system restarts . a real hassle when you start it with a few windows and you have to go through each one . what would be your suggestion in this regard ; am i gaining an advantage by leaving this active ?
would you please tell me what should i do to make it work ?
sorry i forgot to mention that - yes the time has already been corrected .

i am using windows-xp-sp3
this is true . i have access to windows , and mac computers on campus ( but , how is this relevant ? ) my requirement is to be finished the partitioning operation tonight .
good point on the fonts ... the graphics are suffering too though . the issue looks far worse blown up in the image above than at scale . i might replace the printer when the toner runs dry . it 's time to go for something with built-in duplexing : - )
: that works . k.a . also suggested it in the answer below .

- i added the event viewer messages . @ ivo - yes , windows xp .
yep , that 's what i meant . ca n't find the link now , but on one of the ms forums back when office 2013 was still rtm , this problem was discussed at length . obviously very difficult to reproduce the problem , and the only answer they came up with was leave it on `` keep all '' .
i guess i do n't know with 100 % certainty it 's arial unicode ms , but it 's not really the point . that they display properly proves there 's a font installed containing those characters that the system is falling back to , and i want a font for os x that fills that same role .
: nope ... ..
it is a feature for trusted users . it is a closed system so logon access is tightly controlled . at the same time , we do not want to have multiple admin users .
i thought about that also michael but still cant find them . i ended up buying new camera with mic until i solve this problem . i would really love to fix it and i will download the drivers from sony vaio website . i have n't done that yet . thank you very much for your help michael .
the file system on the share is `ext4` .
yes , it worked like a charm . i ran `chkdsk` and it told me that it discovered errors in certain indices of the hdd . and so i ran the `chkdsk /f f : ` command to fix the drive . there was freespace marked as allocated , and some `` orphan files '' ( do n't know what that means ) . it completed the re-allocation and i was able to delete the file .
i do n't know the terminology , it 's through cable . router a lan port get into router b wan port .
problem solved , as posted in the answer bellow , thank you all for the help !

can i copy an installed windows xp system from a hard drive to an usb flash disk so i can run it witout hard drive ..
dp55wb is the model number
could you explain how the os influences this ? the card that i am trying to replace is geforce 7600 gt from 2006 , and it is not capable of smooth 1080p playback . the os is xp and windows 7. geographic position is eastern europe . i 'd like to add , that i do n't feel like the question is vague ; after all i 'm not primarily asking for a specific suggestion as to what card to buy , but rather guidance on how to choose .
i ca n't explain the why here i you do n't mind . i 'm just looking for alternative solutions .
the script is doing some long time fetching/processing from web . but i do n't think it matters . what really matters is that i want to leave my ubuntu box open with this e-mail client while i do n't have remote access to it and remotely run that script by sending e-mail .
my ideal keyboard would be one that allows me to use it with my hands and arms resting in any position i find most comfortable at the time ; resting on my laptop , hanging down by my side . my left hand over here and my right hand over there . standing up , reclining . the keyboard should be a more natural extension to my hands , not some rectangular device in front of me i must conform to giving me rsi . my vision is a glove like device which can be worn . does n't have to be pretty or something to improve typing speed . just something which will be more comfortable for my long days at a keyboard .
i could n't really say whether they 're required . we might have skype calls with remote workers , and we have headphones to listen to music or video relevant to work without bothering our coworkers , but i do n't think we have any part of our task description that requires headphone usage .
of course . stupid , sorry . i will revisit those locations and update the post , asap .
that is the generalization of it yes . however the network consists of about 40 machines give or take , all of which are running similar instances of the same server set up for different ends of development . i am working ui/ux in this particular instance . i tried going directly to my dev boxes ip , and got basically a 404 , so i 'm trying to figure out how to make it so my parituclar machine can share specifically cross the network with another machine on the network ie : my mac . i had a similar issue when using ubuntu with a diff company a while back and the solution was a bridge of sorts

: multiple different vpn clients ... cisco , forticlient , checkpoint , juniper . see this question for reasons not to use multiple vpns and why it might fail :
nah , vbscript is fine too . i would just need to read up how to run it . should be easy doable .
i need knw reason for the error i am getting so that i could correct it
it 's a strange behavior anyway . i think it is vulnerable .
nope . looks like the only way would be to shutdown the system . is there any other way ? also this happens everytime i connect this drive . i remember adding this drive as a video library to share it to my wlna device . i think that 's why that f : drive appeared . i am not able to remove it anymore .
note : the process in question does n't function properly while the os is in `` away '' mode , so here i 'm trying to work around this little problem .

i 'd be happy to set up the network differently , if you have a suggestion . solutions that do n't involve buying more hardware are preferable -- i 'd rather swap my ethernet cable occasionally than pay for another device . the key properties of the setup at the moment is that the router need not be a modem ; and the modem need not be a wireless access point .
yeah , it 's just not there , and that 's what i 've read . i was surprised , too .
i 've tried that , too . i 've also tried using an old email address with all the domain variations . and i 've tried using local and localaccount as the domain .
do you mean security ? if so , under authentication , security=user is commented out .
edit : the worst thing is , if i try to install applications like .net framework , vs.net or sql server in win2008 , some of its components by default gets installed to c : \ drive instead of g : \ drive .
( this is for amyuni pdf converter . they specify to install on nul : port for win 7 64bit . it works fine for us on hundreds of other similar machines . on the one machine that has problems it is due to the disappearance of the nul : port . )
thanks , i will try this in the evening . i was not sure about this point , so i first tried it without admin priviledges . as it did not complain i thought it was fine .
i accidentally deleted a ntfs partition of 1600 gib in a 2 tb hard disk . i tried to recover it using several utilities but could not . so i want to manually specify the partition in my disk 's gpt partition table .
there are no drivers on the crucial website . the only downloadable thing for this drive is firmware update . and there were no disks inside the package .
yes the hard drive works on other computer also if i boot the hard drive through usb enclosure case it works perfectly .

it shall happen like if i click on cancel in the authenticating dialog .
never thought about it . i need to research how exactly that works . in my case that would only be an option if my linux machine can host the pxe server and the win 7 iso image . do you have any link or guide with easy explanations on the process by any chance ? thanks a lot !
it came with software , but that does n't work on my current operating system , windows 7. also , vasiliy borovyak is right .
it 's a new system , and it runs very well . it boots , loads the os , and i can ssh into it , install and run applications ... the only problem is the noise , really . we do n't have a separate room for servers , and the guy working next to it is slowly getting insane . plus i 'm worrying about the constant full-speed of the fans reducing their lifetime .
i 'm working in win7 .
trying to delete some files under `` program file '' , left after un unstallation of software . windows.old is something left after upgrade to windows 8 ?
yes , i do . i experience the problem with every program that tries to access the hard drive after some time ( fl studio , spotify , explorer , games , ... ) , unless i keep cpuid hwmonitor running .
i 'm not a photoshop user either . i do n't see such option at first glance ... something like that would perfect though , as i have whole bunch of images i need to add , not just one . also my images are not in photoshop format , just some pngs .
thanks raynet , i did n't think i was getting that result but i 'll check again . the issue here involves subversion . i need to dump a bunch of folders/files into a version-controlled folder , but it needs to leave all existing files there so it does n't clobber the .svn files .
: did n't have a free computer 'till today afternoon , so there was no point in trying .
no , it is scheduled to run daily at 3:00 am ( and last ran this morning at 3:00 am ) .
i do n't have access to a decent camera right now , sorry . i do n't have my phone at the moment and my laptop camera is pretty bad .
running it on windows7 !
thanks david ! how could i have missed that !
windows 8.1 is my os .
in windows , like some runtime error . in linux , nothing happened yet . i am specially interested in the linux case : how to make this move safe indeed ?
thank for your reply . i want to use it as a web server and also my working machine . i will use it to surf the internet as well . so any suggestions ? thanks .
freelancer.com , facebook.com , stack exchange site logins , pretty much any site with a https connection , except google stuff .
this is not an issue with my domain . same thing happend if i connect to my external ip address .
it could be , i do n't know . are they always text files ?
it is an assumption . as i said , that is for a home environment , so i can only afford a software raid or a motherboard ( fake ) raid . i need it to be extendable , because i ca n't get 4 or 6 disks at once . with `` add '' i 'm saying `` sum of capacity '' . i knew what @ hennes said , but it would result in two logical devices . there is not any better option ? thank you .
, [ this ] ( is just the beginning .
the prompt is for an elevation of privileges to administrator privileges , i 'll clarify in the question .
thanks , ernie . i just wanted to know about the means to save the volume . it looks like `` active file recovery '' application is doing just fine . i 'll also try testdisk .
to make it clearer what i mean : # on linux system touch example : file tar cvf test.tar example : file # copy test.tar to windows system tar xvf test.tar ... ca n't create 'example : file ' : invalid argument
: not sure . see for more details .
nothing , because nothing is selectable . there i have only the `` internal analogic stereo audio '' entry , but it 's greyed out and not selectable .
yes , i am an administrator .
no , nikolay . it 's .edu . in fact i have problem with a series of edu sites , including princeton.edu , gwu.edu , umd.edu , gmu.edu . not all the .edu though , eg . harvard.edu works for me . it looks like the academy is abandoning me : )
by `` it does n't work '' i mean after setting the ip , windows will report ip address conflict ( the ip is different from the one used on the linux machine , of course ) , and the machine have no access to the internet , as well as local network . as i 've mentioned i am sure the subnet mask , gateway and dns setting is correct . if i apply the same setting on the ubuntu machine , it works all fine .
: yeap , that 's may company proxy . at home everything goes just right . the problem i had is that for a couple of days i 'm completely unable to use this ( funny my productivity has increased ) what i do is to let it loading all night long , and then i can use it form 3-4 days more .
the name changed via `hostnamectl -- static`
i hope that there are some existing tools that perform the action directly on the pdf . i have scanned around 1 000 pages with this problem and i am afraid it would take an enormous amount of time to fix all the pages with a simple image editor .

edit : since jailbreak is not illegal , simply frowned upon by the corporation , i 've decided to go with that . i have a nice shell with openssh and the works . best of all , it 's free and it does exactly what you expect .
i believe it is ecc ... but something in the back of my mind makes me believe ecc is turned off in the bios . still , could the lack of ecc really cause this ?

yes i could do that but i want to auto assign ip 's on wireless .
update : it does n't look like there is one . so , i want to create a [ service with automator ] ( # 46308 ) and then assign a keyboard shortcut to it from system preferences . i can get to automator - > service - > service receives selected files or folders in finder.app , but how do i write the script that then runs `rm -rf # { file/folder name } ` ?

it 's just that i do n't know the guy and i 'm fearing that he wants to `` show of his skills '' in a manner that is n't good for me ... i 'm not saying it is infected by anything , but some people ca n't resist installing a keylogger or similar if they have the chance , you can only know if you know the person .
. i would do a big first backup for each machine , possibly with disabled internet and disabled wi-fi ( use a gigabit lan for this first backup ) to avoid cpu usage in the first place , then rsync is going to be used
because as i said , i could n't find any sound file within the html of the page .
i know its far from best practice , and i know its totally wrong to do it this way . however , it will take approx 1 day to reconfigure , and this machine does n't run any crucial stuff so it 's not that important that it `` has to be done the right way '' . the user folder only store some data , and works with files added to a folder in `` anders '' home dir . and yes , this user is only used for the purpose to hold the share directory . none of the users in research group , or `` anders '' actually does anything on the server . @ bram
my laptop also runs with archlinux .
yes there is but when i tried to set windows to that the restore process throw an error and it did not restore windows so i chose the clostet date which was made by avast before i updated it and that worked
i just stop `httpd` service and the `yum erase httpd` . i dind't used any backup just because all the files was in the /var/www/html folder . the onli solution i found is reimage the vps but then i shoul re-install everything

thanks for your reply but actually i do n't have extra port on the router and more if i connect the server directly to the router then the lan users will not be able to access the server locally .
: possibly , but since plugin-container.exe only uses about 80mb at this moment , i figured that the plugins were not making the difference . or is that a wrong assumption ?

the router is seperate from the powerline , eg the powerline takes internet from the router transmits it through the powerline of my house to an emitting station that i plug into the wall and then emits a wireless signal with with its own ssid ( and ip address on the network ) but the router as its default gateway , so essentially its a fancy range booster : p
sorry i was n't clear , but i am mostly concerned with the text . if the size of the bullet changes with the text that is fine , but what i really need to do is have level one bullet text to be 12pt and level two bullet text to be 10pt .
heavyd , i did n't think of that - i just saw the green and assumed . just checked `` find next '' and yes , it skips the sets of 3. can you post in an answer ( not a comment ) so i can accept your answer ?
not much , it 's a budget build as the question says .

yes . the file name for the otf file is something like monopol thin - bold.otf . osx seems to get the display name from meta ( monopol ) and windows seems to take it from the file name ? ( monopol th ) i realize that the display name in the dropdown is what ppt wants . this is the problem . it wants `` monopol '' and i only have `` monopol th '' . that 's why i need to change it . if i was the only user , i can just change everything to `` monopol th '' ... but i 'm not.. when i sent it to a mac user , they do n't have `` monopol th '' , so they have to change it all back to `` monopol ''

, yeah , it is . i have n't even modified the path from the default..
well , a heading with numbering like `` 1. introduction '' is level 1. a heading with numbering like `` 1.1. theory '' is level 2. so two headings at the same level operates within the same place value

no the laptop is not dual-bootable . in some markets ( incl . nz ) they provide the ability to select win7 instead of win8 as an operating system , but this choice can only be made when the pc is first started , and the alternate os is not available once this is done ( otherwise i guess they would need to buy 2 oem licences from ms ) . my question is whether the factory restore function will allow me to make this choice again .

i do n't understand your comment . this is just like having `='john ' ! e4` in a cell a1 ... and when i drag that across other columns it should change to `='john ' ! f4` , `='john ' ! g4` , etc
you 're right . i added an example .
it should since those use the zip compression algorithm . that was actually my main motivation for looking for a solution because i had .war files deployed on an app server that i did n't feel like re-packaing up and re-deploying just to modify a single file .
i 'm using linux right now , but i also have windows installed on my computer .
only groups of spaces , some cells ( like the acer p. d. ) do not have the spaces between the name and size . all i need from the workbook is the names as the sizes are also repeated in other columns .
it is a general question . i used the ip table configuration : shin/iptables -a input -p tcp -- destination port 80 -j drop , i think that would be one way , but i have no idea about any other commands or tools
well it says that it 's connected but on my computer it says connected local only , i 'm using windows 7 and everything is good ... unsure why this is happening : s
[ check on my screenshot ] [ 1 ] ] [ 1 ] [ 1 ] :
i would like to be able to logout and then switch , but by default load into xbmc without loading xfce ( to save on system resources ) .
what if the command works too long and the output is too big to follow ?
well yes . you are right . it is not a problem as in there is n't a solution . this is a problem as in i did something this stupid and am now just trying to understand the repercussions of it . thanks anyway .
it 's ulysses 3 , a writing program that can link to external folders . it maintains a reference ( not sure if it 's path string , url , symlink , etc . ) to the folder which is located on the disk image . when it launches , it tries to access the folder in some way , which triggers the disk image mounting process .
the memory usage is low too . it 's just the hard drive activity thats high .
- no , definitely and unfortunate .
hi @ geob , no it is not , i have a vague idea of what to expect , but sometimes have to test it to visually determine ( wrt my operations ) whether the difference vouches for a new data group or not . the data you see are vector magnitudes of relative atom distances from one that i choose in a 3d atom array . i am dividing them into distances associated to nearest neighbour atom groups .
yes , i can ping , i can access the internet . i tried the 'troubleshoot ' method and it does n't detect any problem . this image shows how weird it is :
nothing 's really wrong with it other than my familiarity with it . i do n't really use powershell and neither does anyone else at my workplace that might also want to use it for a demo in the board room . i 'll probably end up using powershell though if i ca n't find something .
the error 's completely unrelated . i 'm closing the question . turns out there 's no x86 compatibility for scriptcs . there 's no documentation on it . had to submit an issue on github to get an answer .
i do n't want to publicly state my server here , but the exact command would look like `` curl -i so just `` curl -i '' and then the url to the file i would download .
the environment variables i am referring to show in the quoted powershell output . i thought the api gets the values stored in the environment variables .
i think it can be done with just formulas , i 'd prefer not to use vba right now : )
thanks . i will try this in a couple of days when i 'll have access to another monitor . is it win+p or win+p+p ? so we press win and simultaneously p and then p again ?
thanks for the help , i had forgotten to enable virtualization from the bios .
oh ... do n't know ! how can i find out ? i thought green drive series were not external .
i have 6 gigabytes
where in the man do you see that ? i included the man output on my system in question . for the `\ ; ` form it is clear that multiple ` { } ` are allowed , implying they do n't have to be at the end of the command . the `+` form says `the command line is built by appending each selected file name at the end` - but i read `` the end '' here as the end of the string which will ultimately be used to replace the ` { } ` . if it was always at the end , why use { } ? the text `only one instance of ` { } ' is allowed within the command` imlies that one instance can be anywhere ( or else why not restrict it ) ?
: i never bothered to install a vnc server to the linux box . all i did was just enabled remote desktop sharing from the gnome menu so i guess i was using the default vino-server for this .
i never access it from the bottom icon . and the `` safely remove hardware '' , i never used it in the past , and i do n't think i will ever need to use it .
it was formatted as ntfs ( 500gb with 1 partition )
edit : i mean i 'm unable to read contents of disk that i insert into dvd drive . i 'm able to open dvd drive physically and then place dvd in it ... but my sysytem is unable to read it .
thanks for your promptly reply . syslinux supports fat filesystem only , so filesystem of z : is fat ( 32 ) . i have had a quick look at arch wiki , it seems there are not information i need .
well the solution was to open ports 80 and 25 in windows ' firewall . it may sound silly but as i didnt have to mess with the firewall before , i thought it was a problem with the router configuration .
yes sir , i already have . i can connect to it and all but i ca n't access the configuration .
- i have a win7 host and an ubuntu server 14.04 guest . - i have 2 interfaces set up , `eth0` in nat and `eth1` in host-only with a static ip ( 192.168.56.56 ) . - i can ping from the host the guest on that ip . - i can ssh from the guest to itself with `ssh user @ 192.168.56.56` -- - **notes and updates** : - it 's not a firewall issue . i disabled the firewall on the guest and i still ca n't connect .
win xp professional
i have n't looked at them all yet , but so far that 's what it looks like .
**edit : ** i just tried with a new psu , it did n't fix the issue .
it is just a wrap around putty system . i have also used the putty app , makes no difference as the system behind it is the same .
*note : originally this was posted in super user , but i have n't got any response at all for three days . there is much greater possibility to get a response from stackoverflow . so please do n't flag this post . *
absolutely . i added a few that should help clarify .
anybody know what the code is for pulling the date and time of the last unread email in your inbox and displaying that in the body of an email .
all these tools resolve to 127.0.0.1 - so you got something there . we all have symantec endpoint protection and no way to disable it . tracert goes straight to 127.0.0.1 and says trace complete . ping also goes directly to 127.0.0.1. nslookup specifies my dns for the server entry and 127.0.0.1 for address .
i want to draw up a list of older browsers which may still be around , to test websites ' backwards compatibility . i do n't want to rely on market share statistics like statcounter etc .

how can i see apache error_log ?
i have a user who dont know much english and i want him to use the laptop so english menus , etc will be great.. is this enough information ?
i have the latest version

: yes , but if i want to ssh to two or three computers , i 'd have to give each one a separate port allocation .
the version of less.exe that comes with git clears my scrollback buffer when i use powershell with conemu ; vim 's less macro does n't do that .
vga , updated the question .
this is very reproducable for a given page , and from any browser . i reload the browser and every time i reload i see this in the log . there is n't any discernible effect in the output , that is , there is no indication that anything is going wrong . i have also seen that sometimes i get a `` referer '' entry after the number , e.g . [ tue apr 15 12:34:14 2014 ] [ error ] [ client 192.168.100.2 ] 101 , referer : https : // ...
the login attempt is not manual . it seems the script/program is trying to ssh to localhost using the fully qualified username , like user @ hostname . there is no manual control over the process , afterall that is why a passwordless ( local ) ssh access is wired for . let me see if i could modify the script or something like that ...
there is about 60 log files , each from differend date , i need only from june .. thats why : )
`dd if=/dev/sda of=sda.img` the resulting file does not have any content
o.k the problem i have is , that in my computer , i have an icon with c.c
**update : ** the systems are in a same lan , os is windows ( xp or 7 ) , no full remote access is needed . i 'm a developer and my program should run in remote hosts and i 'm testing my application .
which things i have to consider when going from windows to linux ? which pros and cons of using windows and using linux . this do n't want to be another windows-linux war but an objective windows-linux pros cons . for instance , linux have free updates , windows have more software , and so on ...
just `` visual studio has encountered a problem , and needs to close . '' my messenger program opens , but looks like this (
yes , this is the second option . but it 's not so easy to get to computers back and turn off . all usb devices are plugged to single usb hub so i just disconnect the hub from pc .
the application is called lexware ( popular in germany ) . it happens only with it , and while it happens most of the time , intermittently it does work .
: if i am understanding correctly , yes i am using two different usb adapters for both wifi . for 802.11a , i have a wifi dongle connected to ubuntu laptop using usb port . for 802.11p , i have a hardware with antenna connected to ubuntu laptop using usb port . now , i really do n't know if you are really talking about these two adapters or two adapters in ubuntu laptop . i have no idea if i need two 802.11 adapters in ubuntu laptop . please correct me .
yes i can ( also , i run debian stable )
i do n't have another computer to try it out on unfortunately .
oh i see , thanks
the folders are arranged by date and the images are 18megapixel and the total video should span for 1 1/2 minutes .
in a nutshell : my pictures library contains 20.000+ photo 's scattered ( organized ) in a multitude of folders ( yyyy\yyyy-mm-dd ) . i know where the root is but i want to know where the photo i 'm looking at is .
tog , add that as an answer and i 'll mark it approved . i ended up figuring it out on my own but it 's exactly what you wrote .

**edit : ** i did several scans and tests on hdtune , even checked every block of the hd for bad sectors and what not , all came back normal . then ubuntu \ cinnamon \ removal of package 'tracker ' \ other is the offender . i 'm not sure where to begin looking . also , since noon , no crashes .
the current user has full access with full control enabled .
on workstation unlock would also work .
both of the keyboard pictures were found trolling on wikimedia commons . and yes , i used to have a gateway2000 programmable keyboard . the chief thing i remember is accidentally programming it to do something strange , and then being flummoxed on how to un-program it .
doing the reverse is buggy . it lets me drag the label but will not apply it until i click on the email . hope this gets noticed and fixed .
unfortunately not !
it 's ok. i converted dozens of videos with this quality .
the computer port itself seems working as i can use normally other usb 3 devices , and the flash drive itself is correctly recognized as usb 3 on another computer . i tried another flash drive , same model but 16 gb , the problem is similar , as if there was something wrong with this type of flash drive .

it 's for fm radio . with 192khz you can generate a complete fm signal with stereo signal & rds radio text . if you broadcast this with a mono transmitter , it will play on your radio in stereo and show the station name and song info . as a side effect the result sounds much better than a cheap stereo transmitter .

- fair enough , not quite looking for a recommendation , more of a terminology question so i can shop around myself , and to check what price range to shoot for . edited op to reflect this .
no i didnt try to bridge the wifi interface by itself i was speaking of , as pilona said bridging eth0 and wifi0 wich doesnt work as the intel3945 card doesnt support that . @ '' why nat in the first place '' : i cant set static routes on the router that connects me to the internet so i have to kinda fake that all the clients connected via wire to the notebook router are in the subnet the router `` knows '' . the two subnets that exist because of the bridging problem are statically routed and the routes are pushed via dhcp to the client ( which also doesnt work with the router that connects me to the web )
not really , in the end i had a document that was 250mb , so i started a new one , and copied everything over ... thanks anyway

just beeps . have n't noticed any other behavior . it 's a custom built pc . i can provide full system specs if necessary .
because may there is something next to the button , that you are clicking makes the behaviour different . or may be if you will click button 2 times really fast - some undocumented behaviour will appear .

is it possible to do this automatically , when i 'm creating a new user ?
i understand that routers can isolate computers , but i cant seem to find anything in the settings of my router that seems to say this . is there a standard place one would look ?
i have 2 harddrive , one for windows 7 and one for ubuntu . they are both plugged into the computer and during startup , i choose which harddrive i want to load ( windows or ubuntu ) . i have another external hd always plugged in . when i switch back and forth between windows and unbutu , the exteral no longer is readable by windows size . i hope this clears things up .
the other keys work correctly . if i press win key + arrow key the active window change between left , center and right of screen 1 and left , center and right of screen 2. if i press win key + shift key + arrow key it has a similar behavior that if i press only the arrows key ( the only difference is that if the active windows is in the right screen and i press right arrow key the active windows does n't move but if i press win key + shift key + right arrow key the active windows move to the left screen )
that is my problem . i have no idea how . i tried to install the code with the piece of commands i found online and it just did n't work , always returned an error . i was thinking , is there a way to get these packages manually downloaded from the internet and then move them and install them on these actual boxes ? ta
hilarious , but no , being a sysadmin i know to look for pranks first : )

thanks , but do n't worry : i just found that javaws was trying to use a proxy whereas it was not supposed to do so .
i ran both of them and it didnt work
not tried that . i do n't have internet on server , do you know if it 's possible to install `os-prober` on rhel7 without internet ? anyway it 's interesting to know if such disk exist for the case when everything does n't work .
nope strictly terminal
for example , the color of the error message when you type `somecommandthatdoesntexist` .
joeqwerty : thing that the os depends on being there . such as files in program/ or windows/ . this is a extern hd for data files ( audios , videos , backed up code , etc ) . @ doc : i do mean revert . i want any user to add/remove/move files like it was originally

i am running verify/repair disk , but it takes quite a bit .
i edited . ( my problem appears while i was working with my usb mouse and suddenly it was disconnected )

i finally found and issue with my laptop hard drive . it has lots of bad sectors on laptop hard drive .
not the private ip
i open a lot of tabs in chrome or visual studio and i 'm a lazy guy hehe . that 's great to found that , luckily it 's just 1.5 months : )
there is no software for it . no drivers . the only thing i found was the sitepoint app ( which does nothing to help the problem . it works fine in ubuntu and bios without any drivers so .
nope no custom ui or themes
it is a *efi-system partition* , 100mb in size , created by windows 8.1 and is formatted as **fat32** as it should . [ tree of files if you need them ] (
as said above the permissions are `777` . ownership is `tomcat_user` and `tomcat_group` .
: it has n't whined again so far , and it 's 34c today ... thanks for following up ! : )
exactly . when i try to log in with the client it tells me it ca n't connect ... offline mode ... etc . same with hearthstone .
no , it was just meant to show that it 's on a line by itself . using `` ( .+ ) ? $ '' does n't work , as it takes the second word until the end of the line .
.avi format . i also tried .mpeg
**edit** i was thinking about something like tight-vnc 's behavior , where if two users can log on simultaneously with the same username . in this case , keystrokes and mouse movements made by one , are seen by the other .
sorry about the lack of updates . my laptop has n't been hanging for a while so i thought it 's all good now . however , it hanged again yesterday . i 've pressed the caps lock button to check the lights and it did n't toggle . what diagnostic tools should i get to check my hardware integrity ? free ones preferably .
just the display . interactions are still processed .

i do n't have any anti-virus program ( i know this sounds crazy ... ) because i 've never had them work ( they usually just end up break all my games and other annoying side-effects ) . this is the first problem i 've had in 3 years .
no what is that ? for apache2 and service i have command not found . never used them before .
**update : ** i removed google as homepage and i used blank instead and it now start quickly but i think this is still a problem !
yes i have and one more thing , i am just a noob in these technical things . so unable to catch your technical terms soon . so unable to edit the host file and also am afraid that it would reflect on system 's function.. please clear me if i am wrong .
**update : ** i was able to see the drive with a bootable format utility , but it only shows 8 mb . i formatted it and now it has 8mb space . i can hook it to working computer and copy some files in . i am still not sure if all my data is in there . i need to clean it before i return the ssd back .
i want to start console work with preconfigured variables .
open source since i would like to learn about the system api and triggers .
i 'm not sure about that ; i 've no problem reading small font letters , and i do n't need specs to read newspaper .
i am not sure how am i supposed to run |sudo fdisk -l| ( in windows ) since that is where the drive is not detected . it 's detected perfectly fine in ubuntu .
yes i can login

, both the 10m cable from the primary output as well as the 5m are single-link dvi cables . i have not read about an absolute max resolution of 1920x1080 ( it depends also on cable length and frequency , apparently ) , but 1920x1200 does seem around the upper boundary of what will work . i have bought a 10m dual-link cable now , will test tonight ! thanks .
i added , usb and cd . removed sata . i made a new dvd it did boot , but half way through installation the pc shutdown by itself .
different brand ; new one is a belkin card with a realtek chip . old one is an on-board atheros chip .
, it is the `` windows '' icon , leftmost on the command bar that takes you from the desktop to the metro screen . it takes the place and some of the functionalty of the windows 7 `` go '' button .
because the server i am using will definitely get me a good idea of the kind of thing i need , and it was n't bought too a long ago . it will help me focus my search later .
thank you josh . yes , why is it doing this and how do i get it back to the way it was , double click for word as well as every thing else ?
more or less yes , it 's an unusual request , but that 's the requirement of the system it 's going to be input into . there 's a little more to it than that but each row has to have the whole set , ordered , with that row 's item marked with a special character
yeah , i plan on just trying it to see . thanks !
this image is a diagram of want to do with what i have :
they are image files mostly - jpg , png , gif , around 200 kb each , i 'm downloading them from url 's
- yes i 've tried a power adapter from my laptop . it works fine on my laptop but not on the problem laptop
uhmm , is what a laptop ? yes , i 'm using a laptop , why ?
everyone of them .
r hicks , already have psus with active pfc ( whithout knowing actualy ) , it seems to be quite standard on silver/gold rated psu 's . ( why did i go those psu 's ? not for saving electricity to be honest , i thought that since they are powering expensive hardware , it would be safer , since i once had a fried mobo due a broken psu , and these psus have higher mtbf )
i probably could , i 'm just not familiar with the tool . the information i am finding on it is for windows xp and older ; do you have a link with details for `` newer '' versions of windows ?
- not clear about your meaning . you are saying that i should n't ask this question in an open forum because the information is confidential ? thanks .
it is a thing of linux , but some custom kernels do n't come with linux capabilities support .
**edit ( question ) : ** -- -- -- -- from the sound of things , to have proper firewall rules in place i need an additional router . if additional hardware is likely required anyways , would the following scenario work : **wan connects to router 1** router 1 hosts : - machine c - router 2 router 2 hosts : - machine a - machine b *router 2 is configured to block traffic from machine c ? *
no , no boot option with f8 works
, that must be part of it ! ok , just to try it out , can i use an ip address to get to it . something like phpmyadmin.10.10.10.10 if 10.10.10.10 is the ip address of mysite.com ?
did it just now ( yes ) says ca n't run on current boot..
it dose show up..but the partitions do not show up anymore on fdsik -l
unfortunately no
not all know english well .
sorry , both .
i 'm actually trying to use the parameter to limit the transfer size to debug a hardware problem . i am designing a sata device and having problems with disk transfers larger than256 sectors ( 128k bytes ) . the usb/sata bridge appears to only be sending the request for the first 256 sectors and then hanging . is there actually a separate inf file for each usb/sata bridge chip ? i am using asmedia 1x53 chips right now .
jgeer , to increase safety . i plan to use raid 1 .
no , the request is timing out .
- the ps3 also comes with rca , so the idea is that i will buy a converter which takes in the white and red wires and outputs into a 3.5mm female . so i 'll connect the hdmi to dvi cable to the monitor , and the sound through the above mechanism . are there problems with this approach ?
yes , as far as i know , i do know that the 64-bit client i have installed works and i can use it to connect to external vpns .
it is a document we want printed to pdf that will have for basic security measures the ability of not having select able text . thus it will be the same as scanning in a printed copy , just not having to use an actual scanner . it is a requirement from my manager to scan them in currently , but if we can bypass this and just print them as images it will save a lot of time .
i lack the networking chops to answer that question -- my network admin says the switches are not reporting any errors . i also agree that my method of testing -- pinging an application server -- is somewhat barbaric , but it 's the > 1 % packet loss that i 'm worried about here , not the .1 % .
about 2-3 hours for the extended self-test , quite quick for the status check .
, it is a bootable usb disk . if i shrink it with another empty partition , does it still bootable ?
explorer.exe constantly increases consuming paged mem . i did a dump from explorer.exe which is about 4gb . i could try to figure out the leak , if it hurts further ...
: what is the part number of an adapter ? how to get it ?
when i try to enter on my usb , for example , from nautilus , the error message with `` error input/output '' shows pcmanfm shows the `` current directory is not right ''
thanks . updates were there but i had not thought of the bios . there was an update but makes no difference .
yes , if the lan adapter is disabled i can plug the cable in and it will not restart .
yes , the last comment is correct . i need to reinstall windows without losing my files
it helps , but we 're also looking to optimize total system performance if at all possible , and having other things dragging would not be an ideal consequence . i really suspect this may not be doable at all , but if there 's any way to do this ... it 's worth a shot .
there is no qty in source table . location is the header row .
yes , my mp3 player does support faster playback , but it does n't always work , and i 'd like to fine-tune the speed setting .
comments are n't allowed to be as long as needed to give output . will add by editing .
yes . updated the title .
( fyi : we also took a normal backup of all the documents just to be sure of course . i 'm just curious what would happen . i would test it out , but the new laptop has n't arrived yet and i wanted to make sure my efforts would not be in vain . )
- added the output for `ifconfig` : vm1 :
both of those . whether my browser was opened or not , currently loading a page or not , every few hours webpages stop loading . on the bottom of the browser it says `` looking up or whatever site i try loading at the time , and eventually just gives an error ( server not found ) . it 's not browser specific either . i mainly use firefox , but i 've tried chrome and ie when the problem occurs and they wo n't load websites either .
delete all values ( i.e contents ) and formatting of all sheets in the workbook
i dont know ... : ( does it ?
hi this is my first time here , i could n't add a photo as i do n't have that kind of priviledge yet so here 's a link to a screen cap on my flickr account
it 's clearly stated that users should be kept . i found the solution in the meantime . one should export all from users and db tables , without the first few lines in the users table where the root and other system passwords are . the import that on the fresh mysql db on the new place .
i currently have bonjour running , but i 'm still unable to ping my machine from the mac by hostname .
i dont . i just recently reinstall windows 7 on my computer .
i added info about the drives . i did n't think to mention it since they are different and have the same issue , but i suppose they could both be using the same sata-usb3 conversion chip .
i was seeing linked image actually : ) updated question
nope . i checked the file now and it 's not in it , neither in any files in profile.d . also as i said , grepping /etc folder gives nothing : /
yes , i know that ssd outperforms hdd but this is not explained by the expected slow performance . the issues are frequent and can last for several minutes .
ssh is installed ,
__edit : __ after asking [ this followup question ] ( ) and then [ this one ] ( ) , i installed dd-wrt on my router , and i seem to be getting higher and more consistent speeds . perhaps more importantly , my memory use is fairly constant . i know this is n't an answer & # 8212 ; which is why i 'm not posting it as an answer & # 8212 ; but it is how i resolved the situation , and hopefully it 'll be helpful for someone .
i 'm using the address 192.168.1.1
it was n't me that removed it . but thanks for the suggestion .
to print a lot of photo at home .
the full questions is summarized at the bottom under `` summary '' . i 've heard that apple announced a feature like this for one of the leopards but took it away before launch saying that they will not do it because of data security problems . the questions within the question are very much related to each other and the main question itself . _edit : i replaced the somewhat fuzzy question at the beginning of the text with the more concrete one from the summary._
user is an admin , but did not explicitly elevate to admin for cmd . there are other icons on the desktop , so i do n't think that 's it .
`sudo rsync -avz -e 'ssh -p 2223 ' /home/neil/music 192.168.2.162 : /storage/microsd/android` . i changed the default port from 2222 to 2223 on sshelper . 192.168.2.162 is my phone ip address . then password is required both for my account on the machine and in the phone
no . [ obligatory characters to make superuser happy ]
well , it is definitely not easier than having a working ethernet port from the beginning . it is a completely new laptop , i have just received it in exchange of another one which in addition to this problem had another one .
edit : $ ls -l /var total 97 ... drwxrwx -- - . 8 root root ... www ... sorry for not displaying the full output , it is from an offline computer . i do n't know what is executable path but this file is the only one that looks different : lrwxrwxrwx . 1 root root ... mail - > spool/mail
i want to search for files on my hard drives , just like in windows 7. for example , an mp3 with artist like say eminem . in win 7 i just hit the windows key and typed in eminem , it would then return every mp3 ( and other fiels ) with eminem in the name . here , in win 8 , it returns 0 results when doing so , in files , yet i know i have lots of mp3 's with eminem
well i have n't tried it . but many of my friends do use in the same way . their vpns work just fine
why is that ! ? : ) anything i can do ? this way the whole metro ui is almost useless . i ca n't wait for 10 '' to see my emails . and it 's not 10 '' the first time . it 's 10 '' everytime the email app is launched after shutting it down .
health seems good to me - that 's from a disk check . any other ways i can check ?
i just use the standard windows media player for windows 7
yes i have done all of that . i have just noticed that when i do an ipconfig on the first vm i get an ip address of 169.254.* . * address even though the ip address is set as a static address on the nic . this is obviously not right
update : i am presuming here that packages installed without root access would not be installed to the root protected dirs , but somewhere else instead .
: no , it is not .
explanation ( ..as to why does this happen ? which would be an answer i thought ? ? ) .
- i do n't have the ability to test other routers , if that is what you 're asking .
'run vnc ' works and it says it has been successfully transferred the agent but the problem is that it does not bring vncviewer to show the victim desktop
thank you for fast response . | '' why not install windows 10 directly ? '' i do n't have a windows 10 disk . all i have is windows 8 disk , that 's why i need to upgrade it to windows 10 first . |
hi , my app is install font mac os using qt framework . but i do n't how to do that ? i was copied new font files to library folder but how to system recognize that new font .
i want to run a lot of vms whose displays i need to see , but do n't care how it looks . im thinking this will run faster as it 'll need less video processing power ?
not quite . i 'd like the values of those cells to be placed in , say , b1 , b2 , b3 ... bn . sorry about the confusion .
64 bit also , rebooting solves the problem , so probably not a router issue . computer is connected to router via cable .
got it it was port issue , thanks everyone ... port 80 was busy
so could it be my power supply for the computer ?
update : for starting the system , i had to remove and plug again the same cmos battery . also , whether system shuts down due to low power or is manually powered off , same cmos battery needs to be removed and plugged again . while starting the system i need to just plugin the ac supply and it will boot on automatically , without pressing the power on button .
yes , i have everything perfectly setup on a single device , but it is painful to sync between 4 of my other pcs/mac and other devices . i thought that maybe there is some kind of service or technology which allows to setup everything as in outlook but then access results via simpler interface without any setup on the client .
winrar has the option to convert archives , but i get the error `` skipping encryped archive '' when i try to convert it . it asks for the password first , and i know it 's right because that password opens the archive , and i can read/view all the files in the archive .
: while using win xp , there was no problem . i never changed settings for these apps . for example , notepad++ does n't have any network settings dialog .
yes , i 've tried it on three windows machines - all windows 7 .
windows xp professional version 2002 sp3
there is n't any extensions and when i double-click the `` select a program to run this file type '' menu comes .
because everytime i try to mount that partition it asks for my password . however , it is just a guess .
os is windows 7 ( added it to the question as well
no . unfortunately , i only have speakers/headphones : (
i resolved this issue . i installed yandex.disk before . in the event viewer logs there is an application error about yandex disk shell . i uninstalled it and problem fixed .
: that 's skyrim 's executable .
it seems like there is something like this for linux linux.org/apps/appid_2488.html however i think the problem is going to be open file handles , network sockets etc. , which make this a non-trivial problem
if `single_line` is set to `true` , tab indents after the line above which may have wrong indentation , and not after the language rules .
i concluded that the gpu overheated because my room smelled like it was burning down and the fact that my gpu was scorching .
i created a custom box using packer . apache2 is installed and the issue persists when sudo is used
i am not connected to the network , how would i ping anything that way ? not possible
dsl-2640b , yes , the firmware is the last available . it happens with different browsers , and different devices ( windows , linux and android on a tablet )
because the phone is slow regardless of how many times i factory reset it . it 's slower than the first time i 've got it .
it is version 2007
probably not since i can hear audio right ?
well i heard that some if it is kind of secretly veiled from the public , as if they want to keep a backdoor open ? i do n't know , i did n't dive too much into that stuff .
: but im more of a keyboarder .
i use firefox and safari
any unique number like 123145
i edited my question.. please review..
i have updated the description with the information requested
styles are predefined formats . see you can ( both in a vba macro and in the advanced find and replace box ) limit the search operation to only those paragraphs or strings that have a certain style applied to them .
i was reading around a lot of unnecessary writes on ssd are just impacting on the h/w , reducing its lifespan .
i see your point . however , a user would still have to enter the pass-phrase when logging in to windows . i would even be ok entering the tc pass-phrase when coming out of sleep each time , but it does n't even attempt to mount the volumes . the primary reason i 'm encrypting the disks is if they are stolen ( particularly the external drive ) .
thanks for pointing out ! no , i mean other computers not users on the same computer
hm , that might be it . how do i do that in windows ? i thought that when i have admin priviledges , it would inherit them .
another chip on the system board which stores the password ? is there
google chrome 3.0.195.6
it just feels clunky . i was wondering if there were some better ways to go about it .
the file was not downloaded directly from the website . it is with the windows 8 upgrade application .
one note 2010 ...
by swapping the hardware i meant we took the users hard drive out of their current machine , and put into another machine with the same hardware . the users do run similar apps , but the issues dont come up with the same app always running . so they all use firefox , but they dont all have it running at the same time when the issues occur .
driver is from rpmfusion , the metapackage for nvidia , gnome desktop , fedora 12 ( constantine )
outlook version ? it does n't have 'help / about ' like other programs , but it says 'version 14 ' elsewhere .
nope ! & nbsp ;
i tried , but nothing . i think they just might be deffective . any more suggestions ? ? ?
no , because remote desktop ui is unresponsive . i can however log off the vm which makes the computer available again after a few mins .
i 'm using chrome . the link to the game is : the sidebar thing removes the data from every game on the site . i was able to do that with the other link i provided in my original post .
i do n't think so , the problem only occurs when virtualbox manager is running . everything is fine if vbox manager is not running . that did occur to me though , i have a kinesis freestyle keyboard , which has a bunch of extra keys . i 'll try swapping in a spare keyboard .
yes the situation stays the same after reboot .
i do not have the copyright to the music , the visuals are just a home slide show .
the machine is a self-build , and windows 7 ultimate was provided as a bundle with the motherboard . it came in a retail box , with the normal looking insides , and only has one dvd . the only difference is that the os comes with a pre-installed slic and key , like an oem , for auto-activation .
as different user in both cases
the latest ( 9.2.3.21136 )
i do n't know what drivers were loaded at the time , safe mode does n't have sleep option right ? bug check code is 0x000000f4.here is the dmp file
hm , what are the advantages of using str ?
: nice spot , did n't know that site , but ... migrating to beta sites is discouraged and there is no migrate path set either . you might suggest to them on their meta that questions exist on communities like super user so questions like these get migrated when the site goes out of beta ...
edit : everything will be run in windowed mode . edit , for clarifiaction : although i understand one rocking card works , and my card is inadequate ... is one card better than two lesser cards ? can i allocate one card to each monitor ?
it 's a mini-itx case . the ps is normally screwed into the back of the case . i unscrew it and pull it back out of the case so that all the cords remain attached but there is more `` breathing room ''
forgot to add that it 's windows xp 32bit the computer is running .
well the core issue is that i would like a keyboard shortcut for both pokki and windows 8 start screen . currently , it does n't look like pokki provides any keyboard shortcuts for its menu other than replacing the windows key . if you 're aware of one , please let me know .
so basically all i need to do is add a .pages folder in hkey_classes_root and add the same string , binary and expandable values found in the .zip folder ?
uploaded and added to question .
i have only seen the card reach ~65-70c
as your quote suggests , the data segment includes everything . on linux , i believe a process just asks the os to resize its `` space '' ( data segment ) . it 's up to the library ( libc ) to present a convenient interface ( malloc/heap ) .
good catch . ls -ld /var/mail is showing : drwxrwsr-x 2 vmail vmail 4096 aug 11 19:29 /var/mail . i guess chown root : vmail /usr/bin/mutt_dotlock eh ?
: i already synched it several times . i actually ca n't remember if the last time was with windows 7 rtm or a beta , 99 % sure it was rtm . anyways , since this last time i reformatted and never had to sync again until now ( been a few months at least ) , so i never reinstalled itunes .
: yep , tried with my gfs macbook and my ipad ( both works ) . tried to access the site with the ip ( 5.150.255.189 ) - no luck .
what is also interesting is that it appears the htaccess rewrite to switch http requests to https appears to be working ( or perhaps my browser is caching that ) . ttl on the troubled domain is 1 hour , i ca n't find what it is on no-ip , however my domain rarely changes . and clearing the dns cache on my windows machine did not resolve it
one of the valid reasons to use winscp as root would be remotely editing files and modifying contents of directories that you do n't have permission on when ssh-ed as a regular user , all with a pretty convenient gui .

potter - core 2 quad q9450 revision c1 .
it is corrected after i change back manually or internet time syncs
less than 10. no videos . just some images .
yes , there are text outside of those delimiters .
so , instead of call su -l pi -c xinit blabla , i call su -l pi -c startx , and put in /home/pi/.xinitrc the content of startmidori.sh ( which is : xset -dpms xset s off xset s noblank matchbox-window-manager & midori -e fullscreen ) or can i add a path to a .sh file in .xinitrc ?
new macbook pros have their hdd soldered to the motherboard , hard to replace . most stores will only replace your macbook pro with a better one ( they wo n't change the hdd ) which is a cost of maybe 8x that of an sd card .
i am on ubuntu 12.10 , @ jonathanben-avraham . just updated the post with this info .
the application needs to be run as root to prevent the users from trying to kill the process . they can kill their own , but as root , they cant kill it .
as mentioned in the question , the problem is not chrome crashing ( that , i managed to fix ) . the question is about alternatives to **gnome-keyring** .
yep , that is what i thought at first , too .
i mean move the cursor
no . ctrl+ wo n't do anything . using ctrl and mouse wheel changes the view type and cycles through details , list , icons etc .
i 've done all the usual thing : restart mac , unconnect/reconnect hdd , power on/off everything etc .
no , it is a linux raid ext3 partition on a usb hard drive .
it did but i broke the keyboard now im using external one without fn button .
i am using ubuntu 10.04 in guest os , and windows 7 , as host os . the 0 bytes , seems like pipe here is example for such file : cp : can not create regular file `/media/sf_shared_prj/hh/hh_sdk/src/linux/linux-04.02.00.07/include/config/usb/sisusbvga/con.h ' : operation not permitted
nope . the laptop came to me without it . i thik i have a vista dvd from a previous pc ( if it still works ) but that does n't realy help , is it ?
it might have been a little better ... chrome looked like it un-maximized ( was originally on the primary monitor ) , and it did move the ide that was on the secondary monitor over and i think it may have kept *that* maximized . i 'll play with it some more - i thought in the past i 'd had problems with windows being stuck on the now-unplugged monitor and had trouble moving them back . but maybe not rearranging them will have less headache than the other way .
i 've seen it in pre-installed pcs but when i try to make a fresh install , it 's showing an error like `a driver cd is missing` .
after the bios setup screen that displays the manufacturer logo , it would seem that the system boots into fedora for just a fraction of a second and then reboots . nothing is displayed - just that the lcd keeps going on and off making it seem that the system is continuously rebooting since the manufacturer logo does n't show upon system restart . i do n't think there 's anything in particular that makes it reboot . i tried installing ubuntu & windows 7 , both work fine except for fedora .
early 2011 macbook pro running os x 10.7.2
it is not possible . only ones the computer booted from the dvd . all the other times it does n't recognize the external dvd or the usb stick . it does n't show up in the bios or in the bootmenu of the bios .
drmoishe pippik , i sadly did not write down what the errors were ( it is different different times ) . it 's not really an option to use a flashdrive as it runs for days without problems and then blue screens 6 times in one day . i have replaced the ssd with a different one and did a clean windows install .
**edit : ** i use windows 7 x64 [ 1 ] : [ 2 ] :
correct . they 're probably the only pci-e cables i have . i could check my other fully modular power supply to see if it came with compatible pci-e cables though .
- the program is the terminal . the scroll bars are drawn . its problematic because i have an unlimited scroll back . sometimes , i only want to go back 3 pages with 30k lines of scrollback history . its impossible to use the mouse to move the thumb tick 3 pages .
note : nat is enabled .
in safe mode the problem does not occur .
it 's on my dell laptop with windows 7. also it only happens on google on google chrome . i run 1 extension called ad block plus
: added model no to the question
i realize notepad is n't a browser and ca n't load webpages , i was just interested in a way to make windows treat it as the default browser .
it is a desktop running windows 7. its a dual monitor lcd display and when they go dark , they both go dark simultaniously . the windows power settings are set to always on , but i didnt check the bios power settings .
no , i tried ctrl+alt+f1 and then f2 , f3 , f4 and so on , but video never comes back .
i 've not encountered this before , mainly because i never do that ... i 'll try to let it run without ac adapter .
. it also appears when you open the properties of the file . i 'm using windows 8
i have a few different reasons for running osx as a server . my ideal lab environment would be rack-mounted esx hosts running multiple linux and windows vms . believe me , i realize that os x is less-than-ideal as a server , but my reasons are strictly hardware/resource-based . it is the most powerful and reliable machine that i own , which supports usb 3.0. my main goal is to run freenas in virtualbox from a usb drive and have a zfs pool consisting of the 2 internal satas , 2 external usb 3.0 satas , and 2 external ssds . this requires high availability , and osx is currently the only guy for the job .
do you have
it 's not in a pst , it 's in the inbox , i.e . cached in outlook.ost .
: ubuntu 11.04 and its default ssh
update : the pc is running windows 7 , i 've tried by setting up and ad hoc network but it is not detected by the tablet . i downloaded `` virtual router '' but it is unable to detect my broadband modem .
there is just no option to change regional settings in the numbers tab ( nor a `` use system settings '' ) . and i 'd prefer not to change the windows global settings just to get another separator .
basically i mean what is the difference between a virtual cache address and a physical cache address ? ( i was under the impression a physical cache address is in the form ( setno . ( index ) , ( line no . ) tag , and offset ) .
windows 7 enterprise , it 's a government laptop , so that might make this a little more complicated
yep , it is set server-side in our case , but alas i have no control over it . with an add-in client-side i am hoping to circumvent this limitation by having the browser sending some `` fake '' activity to keep the session alive .
c : \documents and settings\\ [ username ] , it 's just where i happened to have a terminal open
do you mean if i just open the bios and see if it does the same thing ? i 'm not sure if there is a battery indicator in the bios
no ... that why i have n't accept an answer..
neither option works ... always fit window has been renamed autoscale video i think and only fixes the video size to its original size , the window can still be resized arbitrarily . resize interface to video size does n't seem to change anything at all .
yes , i do , but i think it is in the 9pin end . so if i buy one , and cut off the usb end , i should be ok. as long as i can track down this connector !
i 'm using magento
how do i get windows into extended mode . i did set it via the graphic options . i can actually see the cursor on the 2nd monitor but nothing else .
that it . thanks ! i 'll re-organize them so they are on the same volume too .
cry , i thought of that but wondered if i could find a non-wifi router . @ daya , motorla surfboard sb6120 . i did n't think that would be possible because when i hook up my laptop to the ethernet port on the motorla , it gives out the public ip . i 'll look into this realy quick . thank you both
, it is connected with vga .
thanks @ brian ! the mint edition was in the question ( 17.2 rafaela/kde ) and i 've added some details about the box . yesterday i installed a fairly identical box with 17.2 rafaela/cinnamon and this was fine , so it does seem to be a kde issue ( or an issue in which kde interacts with virtualbox - i 'd certainly expect this to work `` out of the box '' without the virtualisation ) .
**just added** - according to @ scai comment i already test on another notebooks . on mine , sony vaio , on others , compaq , and mac ( this 3 using ubuntu 14.04.3 64bit ) and on 1 notebook using freebsd . a new pc with ubuntu 14.04.3 64bit . the thing is it can works using freebsd . while on the other 3 notebook and 1 pc did n't . it is seems always disconnect itself . so is it really the usb cable ? or something else ? i 'll try changing the cable . * -- end of added info -- *
i 'm pretty sure it 's auto-pairs .
, 15.0.1 also
by looking at the bar ... . what is a good way to measure it ?
for example , with the iptables command ?
is this the kind of thing you 're talking about ?
accurate now . defraggler or disk defragmenter ? ! ? i do n't know which one is the problem . is it defraggler or windows ? why did defragmenting make the drive
multimode fiber .
no i am not . i just want my server to appear in network as it does on my home network .
sound comes from a tiny tactile switch . it 's a mechanical sound , from inside the computer . the same sound normally occurs a half of a second upon hitting the 'reset ' button , except that it 's like if someone would shoot a machine gun with some pauses . this never happened before .
yes . i 've tried xclock and lxtask . both work .
2-3 flashes . i assumed it was the os notifying me there had been a change within the window , as this particularly happens with browsers
hi there spiff , i can connect to 74.125.224.132 from the ipad and it works fine . i tried connecting to 74.125.224.132 from the laptop and eventually it loaded . i can also connect to 74.125.224.132 from my pc .
i know that `..`refers to the parent dir ... however , a friend of mine created this direcory in my desktop named `` .. '' which contains the content of my desktop ( as it should be ) but how can i remove it ?
see , i have n't posted without any try . i am googling with my team with no luck . we know both 4 and 5 layers are same . but we want to be clarified with the exact standard !
a lot of them , @ vinayak ( i am a polyglot and use pages in a number of different languages actively ) . and i use to visit a nasty site ( not porn though ) pushing a lot of aggressive ads all over it . every day they change their ads to evade adblock so that the ads become visible again , and every time i just go to adblock options , press `` update now '' and all the adds disappear again ( after i wait for the update to finish and reload the page of course ) .

i 'm asking if someone could provide me with an answer to the question listed above . i 've copied the question word for word from the exam paper so their is no details missing . i have also provided my attempt at the question so that someone may correct my understanding if it is wrong rather than just providing me with the answer . @ td.512
tried . i also used > help taskkill to look for info about taskkill , and it signaled the error `` bash : help : no help topics match `taskkill ' . try `help help ' or `man -k taskkill ' or `info taskkill ' .

( there 's enough 15mb 3 page documents going around in the world )
well , the count includes the extended ones too ! ! @ jiggunjer with linuxdev2013 's answer and some research i can now conclude that only windows need to be installed in primary partitions , while linux can be installed in logical partitions as well as primary partitions .
nope it 's windows xp for sure .
i 'm running windows 7 ultimate sp1 , photoshop cs6 13.0 64bit and chrome 39.0.2171.95 m and chromium 41.0.2241.0 ( 64-bit ) .
i used hdclone 3.8 free edition - i would highly recommend it , although it was slow it did a great job !
effectively , i think you might be right . i have n't done any work in databases for a very long time , so forgive me if i 'm a bit rusty . in excel i 've got the local database saved , i just want to be able to update a network location and have the local location updated to match
nah , i use a microsoft mouse . think it happens with and without intellipoint , but i 'll try installing and uninstalling it to see if it makes a difference .
if i am connected to a homegroup , the password is shown in control panel or metro ... but where does windows keep all of them ? : d
that would be great if bt can be disabled in bios . unfortunately , not possible . however , i have found a way to uninstall the bluetooth drivers and to block the bt driver updates ( but even after performing those steps , the laptop was still freezing . the only solution was to update the mediatek drivers - as described below .
i booted with a live cd and did that part in the post scriptum .
if i expressely set the proxy in firefox or tell it to use the system proxy it works fine . i was able to get eclipse to partially work by setting just the http proxy settings . by partially i mean *really slowly* . it would take 15 minutes to resolve an update site and probably housrs to download dependencies . whilst firefox is blasting along .
it does n't work . just confirms the current suggestion .
ps : i have figured out how to program these keys , see my stackoverflow question here : # 23685285 [ 1 ] : [ 2 ] :
no it does n't , i just tried . i recieve a 'connection closed ' , error after entering my password .
i have yet to try a live cd , but i have looked at the boot order of the drives and the 1st hard drive is the one that boots currently ( i have modified the boot order a couple times to see )
he has the passphrase to his own drive . the drive which holds the os that he is not allowed root privileges on ( with a number of reasons ) .
i guess the result of command `arch` , that is in my case `i686` . it is for installing a fortran90 program called f90split . the line in the `.sh` involving ` $ arch` goes like this : `mv a.out ~/bin/ $ arch/f90split`
a few hours before i put it on several files , but i do not have any data now
it is not the boot drive , but i want to assign c : to it . i am now trying a windows reinstall from a uefi device .
: i 'm not sure they 're all of one type , see edit .
do you mean environment.plist ? i refer to this it says 'environment.plist does not work for applications launched via spotlight ' so i was trying to set the env variables using launchd.conf . it works fine . but it wo n't work using spaces or if i concat variables using $
no , i do n't . : / it was written down , and the owner lost it . resetting would be a large pain . so , having an address within the subnet of the router is all i need ? okay , that 's not hard . well , it 's going to be a pain finding the router ( hopefully , i 'll get lucky with an ip scanner ... ) , but i 'll deal with it . if you 'd like to put that in the form of an answer , i 'd accept it . i 'm just trying to figure out how to access another subnet , and it seems that this answers my question ! haha
windows file sharing only works across lan with other windows computers . i need a solution with a web/app interface that is compatible with several operating systems , across lan . it 'd be nice for it to be similar to the google drive/dropbox interface , but running from my personal computer strictly offline .
16 % is the cpu usage , sorry if that was unclear in my post .
-- -- - update 1 : i 've tried running dpkg-reconfigure gdm but nothing seems to happen and it just returns me to the prompt ( no errors ) .
edit : i have acer aspire 4520. how do i know , wether my hard disk is working or not , from boot menu options ?
yes , it is 4pin and i can control it .
the host has to physical nics . one attached to the cooperate network and the other direct to the internet . the vm uses the nic attached to the cooperate network ( bridged ) .
thx , disabled as [ link ] ( and the command returns ** '' access is denied '' ** .
gnome-system-monitor used to show 4 cores , now it only shows 1 , and that one is maxed out and laggs whenever playing video
my fault for not adding that i was looking for a formula .
it tells me : `creating new gpt entries . no problems found . 5860533101 free sectors ( 2.7 tib ) available in 1 segments , the largest of which is 5860533101 ( 2.7 tib ) in size.`
the host machine can access the internet yes , but even in nat mode the guest can't- i have n't checked the host firewall settings thoroughly yet but i 'll do that next- still baffled as to why it 's an issue on a home network and not the work network
edited to add : ping to google.com does n't work , ping to their ip is fine dns settings are coming from the isp , and work fine on other laptops , replacing them with public dns server settings does n't help .
always
we have 200tb of disks . we are constantly adding data , but right now we have around 30tb of data . if fsck is designed out , that is fine . for btrfs it list on their [ wiki ] ( that you may not be able to recover from a crash or losing power . we are going to crash and lose power occasionally , so we need something that can handle this . i imagine zfs would work , and will consider it . there is the drawback that it is only on fuse though .
lubuntu . is lubuntu 12.04 not a lts ?
i can navigate to the path with explorer as well as command prompt
gnu/linux debian ( mostly squeeze )
just a standard 1/8 '' jack
yes , the port is open and accessible from the host computer
yes efs . not bitlocker .
i really want to get the system php re installed , what if i upgrade to mountain lion will that restore the system php ?
yeah it 's for a windows only app.i do n't want it for internet .
i mean the server 's main ip from its connection . the one that the hosting company gives me to connect to it .
will add some more details within a few minutes .
happens even if i boot into safe mode . seems to me it is a hardware issue . i guess the only thing to try is to remove hardware drivers or disable them and then try restarting . will try disabling graphics first . my intuition says its nvidia that 's keeping it from starting in a timely fashion .
yeah i figured as much . the reason i wanted to avoid pasting individual columns is that the users who will be pasting can not be counted on to line up the columns properly if they have to do it multiple times .
there 's no right border . the second image is scanned paper as i got it from printer , with added black frame using gimp .
- thanks . might have a look at one/ever note . @ mehper c. palavuzlar - it is similar and thanks for pointing it out . will go through it .
there is no /var/log/cron.log and in my syslog there is no entry with cron

jforum version is 2.1.8. i used chrome in incognito mode .
**edit : ** the main screen was connected to the hdmi and the secondary to the dvi ( on the card ) with a vga adapter . once i removed the adapter and connected the secondary to the on-board vga , it worked . then i connected everything the way it always has been and it 's working . **any idea what happened ? **
thanks , know about that one , but i would prefer a script ( can be automated , re-used ) and one with a bit more built-in intelligence ( e.g . pre-made filters for what to download ) . if it exists , that is !
hi ray , i again ran the query today morning making the `` dim i as long '' and it worked fine . thanks . also , i am currently trying to build a macro and i might end up requesting help from you..so if you can share me ur email id , i can reach out to you in future . if only if you are willing to though : )
the battery could be replaced , but it happens when he computer is plugged in regardless of power supply , so that is n't causing it . sometimes the computer will shut down without warning and wo n't turn on until it is plugged in again , though .
what kind of restrictions ? maybe also the lack of drivers .
yes , server > internet > so on
it is a tomcat and web apps in it.users access it via web
firefox built in download manager
, unfortunately not . i got the file from someone else and i do n't know which the condition was .
actually , i have n't fixed it . but since yours was the best answer and i 'm too lazy to actually disconnect it , i accepted it .
um , i do n't want to .
is that available out of the box ?
yes it can do pxe boot . i ditched clonezilla and used fog instead.. worked like a charm .
no , i do n't hear any sound at all ...
dear boboes , no , first one is `` - '' and the second is nat . there is n't any bridged vmnet .
how do i resolve this issue ?
if you can point me how to get the error message since the cmd disappears very fast , i will be able to tell you what i 'm having problem with .
: i have n't kept exact record of the times , but i do see a lot of event 1012 `` remote session from client name a exceeded the maximum allowed failed logon attempts . the session was forcibly terminated . '' in the system log .
something called ctos or cp/m according to `fdisk -l` ... this is from a preformatted dell hdd so i guess i do n't need it ?
hmm ... i 'll go ask . it seems unlikely , but i 'd better check anyway .
this is a 14-inch 19201080 display , so i 'd estimate about 157 .
i have unistalled all java stuff . then reinstalled matlab . it did not run either .
i can try it . but i will need a new psu as well . i am at 450 w. also a bug in a game like skyrim is possible , but i am unable to go past the warcraft 3 menu either . also are there any chances it could be the motherboard ?
ok started the command now : do you know how much does it usually take ? edit : the command is still running but it already found something : 35355928 0 drwx -- -- -- 2 32697 wheel 68 20 nov 17:28 /private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd.peruser.32697
sorry , the source code is not available .
g. : see my update .
my second monitor is not working again . i have been unplugging and replugging it in the past few days , no problem . but this morning , after i unplugged , and then replug , it would not come on . when i plug it , pc makes a sound , which means it is recognized .
yes , the font subset is embedded . that might be it . i 've tried to repeat the same sentence a few hundred times and the pdf file size only grew by 4 kb which is just about right . ( docx stayed on 12kb which is no surprise as that is a zipped format and repeated text will take hardly any new bytes . )
the question is edited to address your comment . @ karan
yep , there certainly is . see my answer .
: wireless .
i do not want to change ip immediately . renew , as far as i know will check lease time and if not expired will do nothing .

it came with a linux distro , forgot which . i 'm running a msdnaa windows now , i guess it 's no different than a standard licensed one except that i do n't have support .
**question in short : ** how to install an alternative os on a headless server and what os to use for a home media/dataserver . **long and in more detail : **
: the problem is not the same as before . this one a extra newline character is generated when i press `` enter '' . but before , it is a new line character in the ps1
terdon : dvi ( single monitor ) . dotvezz : i ssh 'd the machine while the screen was black and the output of `lspci | grep vga` did n't differ from the `` working output '' .
yes , everything 's the same .
: any , i cant remember what format it was in this test . possibly flac , maybe aac .
it can do both but i chose to use wifi .
was missing a driver for the reader . that point about the internet : may very well be the case !
: i have some , but it will take some time for me to find them out of thousands of files , which is why i need this in the first place . i 'll get back to you if i find one .
no i want to start a script every 5 minutes to check if a device is online . if it is online , the script executes something . after this , the '5 minute check ' should get delayed for 12 hours .
wow - this was from 4 years ago . it is n't happening at this point for me , but i 've got fresh os installs , and a different desktop computer since then ... i do n't recall what the problem ended up being . sorry

outlook 2010 on windows 7
my computer is a spectre 360 by hp model number 13-4005dx . i will try doing a system restore ( i found a `` critical windows update '' that was done last week ) and see if that works .
update : os : windows 7
vazquez-abrams i found that i have to set `oracle_unqname` to some value before invocation of the line `call c : \app\edifixio\product\11.2.0\dbhome_1\bin\emctl.bat start dbconsole` . but what is the value which is to be set ?
thanks for responding.yes i tried using worksheet and workbook protect utilities , but was not able to fulfill my scenario.but the link shared by sdghasemi was very helpfull .
yes , i was on the system drive .
i just prefer solving it without formatting ( for my convenience ) , cause i see it as a last resort ( easy , but last )
what should i do ? why
but , same thing ( ) works fine on chrome !
i do n't know what aggregation is . clients are pc 's , mac 's , ipads , iphones .
thanks for replying , yes indeed , because i am trying to match the string my_proc inside the variable $ check_run_proc which gets the pid of the process while running..
beck - does n't look like it
i have 360 total security installed , and it has n't detected any virus . i suppose it 's still a possibility though . what should i do ?
i use liberkey , a portable app manager . i had some troubles with automatic updates , so i update manually after some months : ) well , tb 12 do the work well and it is not the cause of that issue ( not seeing attached images on message body ) , so why to use the last version ?
it stalls . before i enter `` get / '' it shows established assured , as usual , but after i press return it goes to `tcp 6 0 close_wait src=192.168.99.9 dst=86.57.151.3 sport=56991 dport=80 src=86.57.151.3 dst=93.125.21.218 sport=80 dpo rt=56991 [ assured ] mark=0 use=2` . no packet with is received . when i finally press ctrl+c , it sends fin to server , and wireshard complains that server 's fin is `` out-of-order '' . like if the reply packed dropped somewhere . when i do the same `nc 86.57.151.3 80`/`get /` from router , it works . how to debug what is wrong ?
thanks nifle ... i have done alot of research but could n't find anything remotely close . maybe i am looking in the wrong places but i 'll give another go at it ... .and also try to construct a better question .
no i only have windows defender .
- i agree but it was n't my design . it 's well over 10 years old . unfortunately it 's huge and while a complete rewrite is in discussion it is not on the table at the moment . i have to work within the current bounds with some leverage to make coding changes in the legacy code . to answer your question yes the apps must be installed to work . the legacy code has heavy usage of com components that need registration .
i 'm aware of the negative performance impact . but the service in question is part of a monitoring program , and the switching between cores causes something to go wrong with the monitoring software , so the results it delivers become unpredictable and sometimes directly wrong . we have investigated it and found out that limiting the program to one core eliminates this issue . it 's not optimal , but thats what we got i 'm afraid .
pivot tables are not a requirement , but it looked like good way to easily represent and cross data in different ways . this is just a simplified example of a typical question , but throughout the paper i would need to refer to the same data and represent it differently . writing formulas and functions for each view seems tedious and error prone as there is more than 50 columns from survey alone .
i am able to ping the webserver 's computer ( 192.168.10.1 ) from another computer ( 192.168.10.3 ) which is connected through wlan0 . i am not able to access the port 3740 , only 3990 and 4990 are accessible since they are coovachilli ports .
the change to this register key is enabling me to redirect the user profiles to a d : \ drive , i do n't want to change it back .
oh , the installer i did and got to the 3rd step which was installing it i think .
edit : follow-up detail that i failed to spot earlier . the first row simply is not visible ; row count that appears to the left of the spread-sheet begins at '2 ' instead of '1 ' . i take this to mean the filter comboy probably remains invisible because that entire row is hidden . how do i make the first row visible ?
i wish you had submited your comment as an answer , i would have upvoted .
hi abashore . yes have tried both and also 3 different ones . like advised above all the keyboard work on another pc and even on the same pc 's bios . its only as soon as windows starts they stop working code 10 ? any ideas ?
i 've updated the question with the info
the leading is the extra space that added above the text . in html that extra space is distributed above and below the text.the line-height = 2*leading + font size ? ? ? i calculate like that and it is not correct ...
where can i find file > connection object explorer ?
it is a 6 floor home with 3 floors below ground level . lot 's thick concrete walls . thanks a lot for the ubiquity tip ! looks very good . i will buy one of their uap 's today and are looking forward to try them out : ) thx !
as i understand it as being with the public key and authorized keys file etc . it 's in /home/mpiuser/.ssh/id_rsa
i can copy ( ctrl+a , ctrl+c , ctrl+w ) a layer from newly opened image ( jpg or png ) and then paste it directly with ctrl+v in the desired document . seems quick , it is , but it could be in one drag & drop . i want to be sure there is no such functionality ( or similar ) , or if there is in cs5 .
i 'll upvote answers that successfully use other terminal emulators if `konsole` in particular is the problem ( but since the question is specifically about `konsole` i do n't think i can give you the juicy tick )
via the deinstaller under `` software ''
no , it 's built in to windows . right click on the taskbar and select properties . all options are there .
2 conditions need to be meet like male + closed ( 2 columns ) however only whant to count that conditions 1 time rather then 1000 times that appears
it 's a stand-alone pc , a humble thinkpad laptop .
why not ? 8 is greater than 7. ; )
oh yes , it was indeed a 3rd party theme . thanks !
what might have changed or how to make it go away
i want the second router to act as a wifi extender . without using any wires between them
i believe it is some form of rate of return , however , `fincal : : : irr` has only a cashflow argument `irr ( cf ) ` , so i 'm not sure if there 's something else i need to be using ?
unfortunately not . i ended up using a microsoft live account which integrates kinda nicely into outlook and works as an exchange account on the ios devices , iirc . it does the trick , but this solution seems to be way slower .
can i somehow push this topic ? i still have this problem . : (
both : i do n't know how to get that information ... there must be a simple command which could find that for me ?
and open ports
calibration was needed . did the job !
scandisk found 32mb bad sector and after its fixing , windows still alert hard disk issue , so i 'm just to reinstall the os , maybe replace a new hdd . @ magicandre1981
i tried in chrome , firefox and safari , all latest updated versions , the same problem persists
intel ( r ) core ( tm ) 2 duo cpu p9500 @ 2.53ghz
no it was not . sorry for the late answer .
, i would preferably like to get the filename while it is downloading . the intent is that i will do some processing on the file once it has completed the download .
`g++ -std=c++11 $ 1 -o $ 2 \`pkg-config -- cflags -- libs opencv\` ` i have tried removing the hyphen is that line as well to no effect .
no , i do n't want to show/hide the *bookmarks sidebar* , i want to show/hide the *bookmarks toolbar* .
yeap , double checked from process exploer , it was a dialog from explorer.exe
, since my application is a commercial one and source code should be a closed one
hi . i think i already said i am using linux . i am not trying to convert to a particoular format : i am looking for a general solution ( i may edit my question to make it clearer ) . thanks .
it 's a strange keyboard malfunction . when i hold down left shift , capital t wo n't work . if i hold down right shift , capital p wo n't work but capital t works . tried another keyboard , and it is not system related , but keyboard bug
psu . they do go off sometimes though during sleep . i wonder if certain apps tell the os to not go into a deeper sleep sometimes .
i cant unfortunately , its behind a password .
in our configuration , we have 8 processor chips each with 10 processor cores ( the os sees 80 processors ) so we 'd like for only one processor core to be used on each processor chip .
i 'm targetting various browsers on mobile phones .
yes , that 's what i 'm using .
my bad , should 've included that . i 'm running xfce , so it 's xfwm4 .
: a system that would originally let every program do everything restricted to no-program-can-do-anything and the operating system lying about what is happening ( think fs virtualization ) , except when the user agrees to unspecified `` changes '' , at which point everything reverts to _anyone can do anything_ . there is no meaningful middle ground between `` nothing works '' and `` can fuck up the system , no safety net '' . that 's really the most stupid thing ever ( admittedly unix worked that way for 40 years too , but that 's a different thing , and they 've got fine-grain control meanwhile ) .
why does these lags occur and how to solve them ? waiting several minutes for content of file totally destroys workflow .
yes , but it does not seem to work : (
i completely forget ! i can do some av tests if it would help .
i tried but it wo n't connect unless i'my really close to the source of the network
kevin panko and micheal kjrling , hi and thanks reply ! well yes i know that my question it 's not really a question nor a response sorry for that ! i was curious on why ddrescue not copying data when the file manager of puppylinux does . also strangely i know that using ddrescue with /dec/sdc copy the whole drive but the problem was with the partition ( in this case sdc1 ) was not correctly recognised as `` sfs '' from ddrescue , puppylinux for some reasons read it correctly as ntfs .
it 's an asus n53sv-sx711v
yes , some thing like this
windows 7 64 bit .
lets say , hypothetically i play a ridiculous number of silly flash games , how might i persist that local storage of 'achievements ' and saved games across computers .
i just did with some linux machines booted from some virtual cds . it does work , although it 's slow so it will be interesting to run windows 2008 and 7 / xp .
bcoz , i use laptop from home to access office desktop and while traveling to office , laptop would be closed and connection closes .
if i open a .jpg file on windows it will know that it has to open that file with the associated program rather than any other program . so its being used by windows . how did dot get there and not any other character that is what my question is .
, unfortunately , only windows . i would also like to test on windows .
how does os x 's terminal compare to ubuntu 's ? is there a tool which is fully compatbile with gvim ?
being an almost complete novice at excel and visual basic , it would be nice to see you express your thoughts in a proper answer : )
nope , open a new terminator instance ( or terminal actually , so i guess it 's a zsh problem ) and ctrl-d does n't have the intended effect .
**edit : ** no , it 's not a disk image . it 's attached to a time capsule and accessible from finder under shared > timecapsule > attacheddrive
the script 's permissions are `-rwxr-xr-x` - and it runs when invoking it without `.` before it . can it be related to the fact my shell is tcsh ?
i am using **ssh secure shell v3.2.9** .
yepp , i am using adblock plus . i disabled without success .
i have issues only with the windows 7 os ... ... ..my windows 8 users have no issues ... ... ..as this `` refresh without affecting files '' feature in recovery helps a lot while fixing the issues
( ps : i 'm running the ubuntu in virual-box with default settings , and the type should be pptp )
actually it 's the `a1 : a10` range giving the first ` # value ! ` error , that then propagates to the rest of the formula . but barry 's answer seems spot on , although lacking in explanation as to why this behavior happens .
just checked - no .
ignorance and lack of sufficiently honed intuition regarding many of the tools in the typical *nix command-line toolbox , is what was stopping me . i think you just answered my question . thank you !
no.if freeze is on motherboard screen ( where shows f keys for menus ) it restarts otherwise even on bios it just freeze .
( be it hdd/ssd or usb memory stick )
interesting idea ! i 'll try this and report back .

ok , so firstly when i go into `` open '' on the file button , it shows open from skydrive with a sign in option below it - when i click on it i get no respose at all , there is nothing here .
nothing happens still the color change is per line like in the screenshot
i am using opensuse 13.2. yes the network manager is active .

windows 7 os
selecting multiple files within a given folder and then sending them to a bluetooth device works , yes . that 's pretty much the same as sending the folder to the bluetooth device ( which in my case is either not supported or does n't work by design ) . the only difference is that all files are stacked together in the same folder on the receiving device , so no folder that separates the files are created on the receiving device .
no . i have not changed anything in chrome : flags
i do n't have another usb except backup drive . i think this time it should work . i used chrome recovery utility to remove any recovery and boot info and formatted it . though it was n't showing in explorer . i thought lets use diskpart to assign letter and now it shows in explorer . i am again trying to make windows usb installer and will see if it works . hoping this time it should work
shows the rocker switch i 'm trying to get the the usb to disconnect and connect both power and data in the off and on state . the risk is , i do not want to cut the data cable if i do not have to , and if indeed i do need to cut both data cables , i 'll need 3 switches instead of the 2 connection rocker switch i have in the picture . i 'm not adding any device , just a switch to power off the and cut off data to and fro the microscope . i hope this clarifies things .
we 've had `` discussions '' with the hacker and the ip address is 2800 miles away right over his house . he runs a web service and has experience . we 're handing this one over to my boss . if he sees this then there 's no point . i thank you very much and will recommend your site to others . by the way from what we traced his ip seems as if it 's coming from a virtual machine but i do n't have the log with me to explain how far this was traced . this system uses norton and i 'll take a look at blocking incoming connections . thanks for your help .
it is n't blocked - i 've mentioned it works fine on ie & chrome .
1. the smashed dongle was unfortunately discarded . actually come to think of it , it may still be in my trash can . i 'll rummage around . 2. by `` useful purpose '' i meant either as a functioning computer keyboard , or some other computer related function unbeknownst to me . if all ell fails i know i can use it to hold a window open . but i 'm looking for it-related uses for now .
wow it was `` chrome toolbox extension '' . but is there a way to have it enabled and videos still play . because i really want tab scrolling
the desired behavior is to execute a script when a particular truecrypt volume is mounted
hi , trying to find solution only using ed .
yeah i know that is there but i need to do it via script ( to automate the setup of machines )

well , i 'm using firefox , but the same thing happens in chrome
i do n't know . i tried looking at the manufacturer site and other sites , but could not find the model name . i know asus makes their own motherboards , so it 's an asustek motherboard .

holy tech support ... i did see a logo for iyogi and wondered , but they said they were the webroot tech site . stupid me . ( when i google webroot , `` iyogi '' is right up there . ) i bought the webroot via cd at best buy on their recommendation when i bought the pc . i wondered about letting them do the remote system stuff , but i was desperate . i suppose it 's entirely possible they planted spyware or something . i think i will remove it .
it 's flash ( swf ) embedded into an html page , like a regular website . i can use js . i can use any version of ie .
thank you james , i guess that answers my question . is there any way i can know the actual bit rate for sure ? like a simple app ?

i do n't see an `` elevate only '' option on my uac slider . are you referring to something besides the user account control settings window ?
update : i 've found out where the bar came from , it was because the file , edit ... ... bar was not locked , i locked it and it removed the line . does n't fix explorer crashing though : (
-- - **note** -- i started a bounty to revive this question ( hoping it 's not a duplicate , but it has more than 1k views ) , in the sprit of [ what can we do for new users who want to ask a question thats already been asked , but hasnt yet got an acceptable answer ? ] ( ) while this has bothered me in the past as well , i 'm not using windows so i might have to rely on other people 's upvotes to see if any new answer is right ... a list of troublesome websites might be eligible too ! ; - )
if there 's something else that achieves the same requirements , that would be fine , although i 'd like to avoid third-party tools if possible . but if there 's a perfect solution that 's third-party then i 'm willing to consider it .

microsoft firewall isa server not sure what version .
as far as i know no one has registered the pcs to admin anywhere . even i was using wifi without registering for last 2 years . it all started when i installed windows 8 .
i gave up on getting the filter to work . i got the encode to run by cropping the first frame with imagemagick ( only need to crop the first frame ) .

lol - nope ... the second i type anything it just autocompletes again .
nope sir . this command removes the drive name from nautilus menu but does not power it off .
- i can access the folder , and also i play those videos using dos . but when i try through gui , explorer crashes .
c. this is with just vim 's generic options .
i suppose that is the next logical thing to start troubleshooting .
: the folder is named `phys542` . like i said , i highly doubt that 's any sort of standard folder . @ jrobert : the folder is owned by me ( it 's a single-user system ) , so unfortunately that does n't tell me anything useful . well , i guess i know it 's not being created by `root` but that does n't narrow it down enough .
i tried using both the numerical ip address and the name-of-mac.local one . the first one it was n't able to connect to and the second one it was n't able to recognize by name .
good question because it allows me to clarify that i am **not** interested in more than one dhcp server on my network . only the 2nd router is dhcp . the 1st one ( the one connected directly to the internet through a cable modem ) is 100 % static .
i 'd like them to be two separate networks so that i can take non n traffic away from the n router . what 's the best plan ?
uh no , i don't.i only got one phone with a filter in a socket , the router in another socket without a filter .
that 's what i ended up doing , i just ordered a 32gb one for 10 bucks . the original cost me 20 about 7 years ago , so that was a bit mind boggling for me .
: is n't this what coolers already do ?
they 're different drives but the block sizes and file systems are the same .
i did it using that only . i want to write a script or a bat file to automate this . but i cant find how to trigger event based tasks using command line . nd i dont think i get any event log
not that i know of , the only version that comes up when i search is access 2007 .
they are just two images of fingerprint readers , with next to it text explaining their functionality . it happens on any page and also at an other document . i think this went wrong when i inserted a header and/or footer . i 've tried to reformat it in word 2010 but the problem persists . i 'm now going to put everything in invisible tables instead but it seems to me its a bug or something .
set hdd as the first boot device and still got the error . first time i restarted it loaded fine , the second time i got the error , so it 's sporadic at best . i 've even once in a blue moon have it occur when i go into the bios and select boot , and it takes a 2nd try to get it to boot correctly . motherboard is brand new , maybe a couple of weeks old .
no it 's a personal computer .
it was the first time i did this edit . i do backups once a week .
i 've removed all programs i do n't need from my pc through either control panel or revo . someone told me it 's not a driver issue though since my kernel memory was n't unusual . either way i ca n't find a clear and concise list of all drivers , where in control panel would i find this ? is it the same list as all the programs ? i 'm going to try booting in safe mode now .
yeah , several , but all used . we need cs 5.5 download and key .
i edited my question i think the correct term is serving pre-compressed files
hardware is phenom 9550 , asus sli motherboard on both . 2 250 gfx not hooked up , 4gb ram . i own a multi meter and will check voltage
i was merging a simple partition and an extended partition which can not be done under windows , i was using acronis disk director bootable media and mft is corrupt , mft mirror is also corrupt.i dont have any backup . this was my backup drive . if the mft is intact then even i can recover it .
jcolebrand : i dont have any userscripts or extensions installed . btw , what does `` repro '' stand for ? @ sathya : thank for the link that you gave . the comment that was given by sied ... @ chromium.org really help me and the problem was solved . `` in chrome : //plugins , click the `` + '' sign next to details on the top right to expand all information . in the flash category , search for the plugin with the location that ends in `` ... pepperflash\pepflashplayer.dll '' , and try disabling it .

i tried to compile myself but i want to switch between 2 version of git . git 1.6.3.3 for work , but git newer version at home . how can i do that ?
it is an imaging device , but the usbvideo.sys driver does not allow for any config params to throttle bandwidth .

i want to change them
so they have a database of dangerous code , the database is sent to my computer , and then a script scans through the computer , and compares the code of the files on my computer to the database ?
i could n't find anything related to that . but i 'll check again when my class is over .
thanks john t. question edited to include command .
no , i had to buy a new hard drive . weirdly , the 160 gb hdd mentioned in the post is still working in another computer , but the asrock motherboard will refuse to recognize it .
: yes , after clicking on `` yes '' its opens the excel . di n't open when clicking on `` no ''
no , they are not . i think ollis solution will work . however , i did not test it yet .
- i have n't used third party tool to check . it 's a work computer , and we ca n't just install software when we want .
yes even with network
ogg is required . and if i 'm doing a 2-step process , i need to be able to preserve the art , so i 'd need a tool for that .
the users are offsite . ideally , i want to send them a url that links them to the spreadsheet . from there they can view , enter data , and interact with the spreadsheet .
for example ... . i have configured exchange account for myself . i want to access my friends mailbox so i gave permission to myself on his mailbox and configured additional mailbox . now i am trying to removing the additional mailbox and it is not happening . getting error '' can not remove mailbox as it is configured with email account '' whereas i have already remove mailbox permissions..
: so the example in the link given does not make any sense ?
- tools exhibiting the problem were all written in-house but the main culprit was last updated 03/03/2014 and first installed 2009 , the newest was installed just days ago . the problem has only shown itself in the last week . no known correlation with jvm - sorry to be vague here .

i do n't know that it was put on a usb at all ... .i think someone may have gone on my pc and put it on their usb .
edit : forgot some info and made some more testing running the router with dd-wrt does not solve the problem . running 100 packets through 2,5 ghz produce 0 % packet loss .
pretty much identical to the example above ... tried it with ` $ home` and it still did n't work . e.g . command 1 : `cdpath= $ home///tools` command 2 : `echo $ cdpath` ( displays full verbose path correctly ) command 3 : `cd tools` ( yields `bash : cd : tools : no such file or directory` )
ok.yes from 4663 event id i was able to get the information . but the auditing shows lot of events and it makes the file security.evtx large . can i make only required events to get saved or can i make only selected delete events to get noted ?

it does n't even open
yes network sharing is enabled , it works fine for one , but when i 'm trying to access the other i get this : '' ip address is not accessible you might not have permission to use this network resource ''
so you think that i can forwared the port beacause of my router 's hardware ?
- the reason is because i 'll be substituting it with a command such as `mv`
yep , `` save copied of messages in sent items folder '' is checked . but i can see neither messages sent from windows mobile or from my desktop outlook in the sent folder .
, because of kim 's bitching . but it seems pretty clear to me , just need to get a nas enabled device or external casing and pop my hdd in there and hook it up to the network .
acrobat reader is more likely to be available to the users of the document than ms word .
yes it does . if i add a dedicated video card via pci , can i use a cheaper video card in combination with the on-board video card to output to 3 monitors total ?

for centurylink , that device is the router . and then currently , the router settings are automatically pick dns servers .

ok ! got an account and can comment back . edits done .
____ **andy** describes my setup a lot better than me : > ok so let me check i understand the setup . you have a laptop connected to the internet with a dynamic ip . you have a workstation that 's permanently connected to the internet with a static ip . you have control of these two machines . there 's a server you do n't have control over that wo n't let you do a file copy from an arbitrary ip address , but will allow it from your workstation 's ip . is that about right ?
well may be i just typed it `certmgr` without any extension .
in the original data ? no , i 'm sure they are unique . but , in the new data there will definitely be repeats .
it is not linked . windows is actually looking at that location for the users folder . i followed these instructions when installing
update : i tried the instructions at [ yahoo ! answers ] ( ? qid=20120426200252aampoke ) , but the directions are unclear and i ca n't tell whether the `.exe` i 'm running is going to wipe out my working computer 's windows 7 installation .

- that 's correct , except they were running win7 before ( & playing nicely with the iphones ) but all were recently reinstalled from scratch ( scorched-earth approach to virus removal ) .
interesting thing to notice is i get normal speed while downloading torrent inside torrent client softwares . this slow speed issue applied to download from any web browser or installing software using terminal .
no , the point here is not to synchronize the files themselves , but the metadata and only have the server download the actual files when needed . ( and then delete them so as not to take up space ) .
yes , that could explain it , but how does that tie into the windows photo app itself ? that is an image viewer , it should n't have anything to do with syncing to the cloud . of course , i 'm probably wrong about that . these days , all sorts of mysterious stuff going on behind the scenes . and i 'm a microsoft software developer !

edit : i would like it to be on top of two drives that are already in use and have data on them . the easiest solution i can think of now is a vm running windows 7 with a software raid inside of it , where the two files for the drive are on separate physical drives . unfortunately that has a lot of overhead . i already have two hdd 's , so i was planning on just doing something with them before buying any additional hardware .

moab , no , i do n't even see it pop in and out in the process tab of the windows task manager . if i attempt it execute it with run as administrator , i do see dllhost.exe appear then disappear in the process list though . i ca n't be sure , but what looks like `` consent.xxx '' runs right before dllhost.exe , which is probably the uac that appears . also , i looked through the event viewer for any information , but i did n't see anything .

i 've checked again and you are right , bookmarking works in both ui but only for songs ( except for flac format ) , it does n't work with audiobooks , although they are in mp3 or wma format , bookmarks field is missing in the metadata window i do n't know what is the reason but i 've found out that the workaround to this problem is to manually insert bookmark field and copy it , then select all the files in the audiobook list , go to properties and choose paste fields command in the drop down menu
correct , the data is in a single cell , and the time would be `` american '' time .
**update : ** to address concerns that this is related to fat file size limits , the xp partition is ntfs and i see the behavior with a 1.69 gb ( 1,694,770,716 bytes ) file ( though it happens with other large files too ) . there 's also an intermediate size where the wizard will fail , but copying via explorer works . above some size though , now way to get them transferred that i 've found .
thus far i 've only tried the change for all new spreadsheets which works even for setting hyperlinks for new spreadsheets , but i 'm not sure how to apply that to existing ones .
i can certainly update the bios , but i 'd first like to understand the issue , since the symptoms do n't suggest a bios issue to me - it started after a simple reboot ( i.e . i have n't touched anything in bios or updated the bios recently ) . if nothing else comes up , i will go ahead and try that though , as it looks like there have been several updates to my bios version :
no , it is rendered by xming , and i can not see how that would be offtopic , since it is nothing but a windows port of x , same rules for the protocol still apply . you are really not doing me a favor here .

unfortunately this application is for a large warehouse where there would be 102 racks/coloums . i was looking for an efficient way to list what racks an item might be found in so they can re-organize our inventory . most likely a singe code/item would only be found in 1 or 2 different racks at most . @ class stacker my excel knowledge is minimal and after a while on youtube and other sites like this i have not found a solution . i appreciate everyone 's helpful responses .

when you say reformat i assume you mean complete uninstallation ? english is a second language to me . yes most other computers have the same specs , at least 50 of them do . i could just do a complete uninstall and install again , it would be a hassle though cause first of all i do n't even know if office is the problem , secondly the user has a billion favorized settings . ( none that would explain chinese symbols though ) and then i might end up deleting them for no reason if it does n't fix it . was just hoping someone had experienced this before .

thanks @ magicandre1981 . the account is an admin one . i must confess i am a bit hazy ( well a *lot* hazy actually ) on the difference between running an application with admin privileges , and running an application when logged in as an administrator . as i want to run this task at startup - at which time presumably no-one is logged in - maybe that is affecting how windows presents the application when it is started from the `` run '' context menu of the scheduled tasks .

this popup message simply occur out of nowhere at random times . is this something i need to be worried about ? what 's causing the error ? how can i fix it ?
and here is
the computer runs slowly or freezes at times ... no matter what i do ... like opening a new tab in the browser also takes time .
i can honestly say i would n't know how to tell if i do or not . and even if i did n't , i would n't know what to do from there . i know a few things here and there about computers , but i 'm still very much an amateur .
come on , a downvote ? i 've been working this problem on my own time for 2 weeks . i came here for some advice . do n't think i just dropped it on you because i could n't use google .
thanks i fixed it myself . i wanted to answer the question but the web site would n't let me cause i do n't have enough credit .
if you are talking about add a service to a working windows , so yes i can , i can add a work-able service , a fake service
no , all of them are local users , and the printer in question is a network printer . i ca n't , for example , change the port the printer is installed , only the owner/creator can .
it 's actually the format that it comes out as from `icscls` .
updated the question with your answer .
hi chris , thanks for reply ! i use win.7 home . the driver of my monitor is installed , when i connect the graphic card to tv and then dissconnet it and connect to monitor , it detects the monitor as `` unknown monitor '' , and in the menu of device manager it does n't show me any monitors , so i ca n't update or install monitor driver while the r9 290 is connected .
not really ... i checked the list of devices and could n't think of any that received a driver update recently ... which one could be causing this besides the graphics driver ? thank you
no , when i start the pc , the message center tells me i may need to log in using my web browser ( not exact words ) . the network icon has a yellow warning triangle . when i mouse over , it shows my lan connection and states `` no internet access '' i 'm using the affected pc right now to post this comment .
**update : same issues also occurred on snow leopard**
address 10.72.8.1 and similar . why is it expected behavior ? i was suspecting this , but ca n't understand . if router was told that some address is reachable via some interface , then why is n't it route accordingly ? please explain .
not that i can see , but i 've never used event viewer before .
win 7 64-bit ...
, i have reproduced the problem with ntfs . btrfs and zfs with data checksums will conspicuously fail to read corrupted files , but the corrupted data will be unrecoverable . more redundancy ( e.g. , fs-level mirroring or raid mirroring ) will be needed to recover these files . in any case , i am of course not using the momentus xt until i figure out what 's happening .
yes . i also tried running cs_install.exe as an admin .
if the command `` ./update_artifact1.sh $ artifact_version '' fails , the other two commands ( `` ./update_artifact2.sh $ artifact_version '' and `` ./update_artifact3.sh $ artifact_version '' ) do n't run . do you understand ?
my goal is to be able to rearrange the relative positions of the monitors without the desktop backgrounds being distorted .
u know when you switch on your pc how all lamps ( cd , cpu , camera , etc ) blink once .
yes , i used another account but same issue occured
yes aaron i am the admin of the system . @ rik : yes there is a red exclamation in the event log . this is the log `` the windows firewall service terminated with service-specific error the data is invalid.. '' as you can see the log is unhelpful .
... actually i 'm not . i 'm using the music app , which is a preview metro app . i 'll update the question , thanks for pointing that out .
- it happens on multiple sites . on some it seems to happen more consistently than others . does n't seem to happen on all sites . it has happened for youtube .
edit : per suggestions below , i tested when wired to the modem and received 15mbps . is that a typical drop when going from lan to wireless ?
2008r2 sp1 ( and some other text to fill minimum req . )
mine has about 280gb . and its all full . and why waste even 1gb for drivers which do not provide any specific improvements ?
yes i did , had no effect
the manual says - `` the wireless client table displays a list of current connected wireless clients . this table also displays the connection time and mac address of the connected wireless client ''
the game pad works as usual but only the force feedback driver got uninstalled .

how do i check my system proxy settings ?
it 's for windows ! : - )
avi ... . and according to the test you suggested , it 's software-rendered ( both on vlc and mplayer ) . forcing mplayer to use 2 cores instead of one made both cores to run at 20 % approx , but the video still stuttered .
so where should i ask ? looks like nobody in the world cares .
the port i 'd like to keep powered during suspend is blue ( usb 3 ) . any way ?
no , i want a tuple for each point saying if the color is a cmyk color , and if it is , i need to know the cmyk color code as saved in the document . the pdf files i generate contains cmyk colors not rbg . what i need is a manual way to read the pdf file , so i for example can verify that the black color i use in some of the graphics really is encoded/saved as the cmyk color ( 0,0,0,1 ) in the pdf file .
i believe ftp.currentsite.co.uk is just an ftp server , not an sftp server . would this be a reason why it fails ? i could use ssh.currentsite.co.uk ?
- yes
i use nginx-rtmp , but since gstreamer 1.2 it include hlssink element , try to use it .
: yes , to see cpu usage at a glance . @ jtbandes : yes , this is a different problem . the icon is supposed to show up there any time task manager is open ; `` hide when minimized '' takes advantage of the fact that clicking on the icon brings up the task manager . the bug is that the icon is not there .
the file format is avi
nothing else in x.php file ( it 's allowed and recommended to omit closing tag ) . fixed my question to avoid confusion .
i have access to all computers providing im on their private networks . i do not have access to computer c over the public internet .
- two points : 1 . ) have your really found html email incompatibility to be a problem ? which email clients today can not display html formatted email ? in my decades of emailing , i 've not once heard from a recipient that they were unable to read my html formatted email . 2 . ) my email client automatically converts urls in plain text email messages to hyperlinks .
yes i 'm indian ! and i 'm definitely gon na complain about this . @ mattdmo
my institute provides a windows-only cisco vpn client binary which has everything configured . they do n't want to tell me how it 's configured , so i am stuck there .
no . who gets off at 4:00 ? i actually need to tell myself to goto bed .
, everything was upside down ( i already solved the problem ) , as if you hold a book upside down .
i set up a new apple id/icloud account for my laptop although i still use our icloud account for itunes and email
how do you mean ? a php project ?
no it is not under warranty .
the issue is with starcraft 2. possibly with diablo 3 as well when there 's a lot of animations at the same time . i will make some tests on it .
yep . i 'm fine with that . assume i know how to write a pam module . is it possible ?
t : it is a application for authorization when connecting to the internet of my provider . it is under vista .
nope , no radius server nor another provider managing authentication .
no . it is not working anywhere . indeed , i bought a new hdd and used the same cable and port , and that one worked . so it must be the hdd itself . i even connected it with usb docking , and the result is the same .
thank you for the comment troggy . well , i would like to know about both . this is all new to me .
it is exe
yes it is a samsung . i think samsung syncmaster 226bw
nothing at all . i 'm even running tests with my notebook one meter away from the router
updated . i used python2.7 and python3.3 .
forgot to mention , i connect using ethernet gigabit and wifi , updated my question .
thanks . fixed the slash reference . the remote windows box reports the keyboard layout as us .
i 'm using vmware 10 , i know a clean vm windows 8.1 works as a sugar , but my problem has begun after i updated my guest windows 8 to windows 8.1 using the installer
reset the password
sorry for the complex example , i will simplify .
***** update ******** my acute issue was due to a bad password . i think this might constitute a bug in the nm or nmcli app . i assume that it should be possible to interpret if a login is `` rejected '' with a more explicit error .
: its wireless connection ...
is it not appropriate to do so ?
i want to create an iso with all the packages , and latest updates under main , and restricted components . btw i do n't see the packages ( *.deb ) on the repository url for example i can view all the latest rpms for centos on
v17.0.8.01aug13 - whatever came pre-installed on the laptop
not really , how can i know ?
thank you a lot for your support and information , i installed pc wizard program to look for temperatures all time , while gaming i saw it rises like 10-20 degree in 5 minutes , just shuted down my pc , unmounted my vga ( used some tutorials on internet cause i 'm not the hardware guy : d ) i spoted massive dust ammount inside vent , even i tried to clean inside of my pc like once a month , but probably my air pump was not enough to take all the stuff away , after i took everything out and cleaned perfectly vga is like new now : )
alex , i 've changed selected to boot on safe mode under the `` boot '' tab . ramhound , lockhunter is a program that tells you which process is locking your file or folder and it pointed to explorer.exe in this case .
yes , it is nated in .
i started by using tcc inside conemu , but i want the clink enhancements and clink does n't seem to be working with tcc , so i 'd rather try the other way around .
i 've never seen the nas working at gigabit speed , but until yesterday i did n't even have a router supporting gigabit so.. it was normal . the cat5e cable that came with the nas should be more than enough for gigabit , i do n't have a cat6 one to try but i will try buying one .
no it does not have fuse as well..
edit : i 'm running windows 7 .
if i make the smaller monitor my primary monitor i have black slides in the sides , in the top and in the bottom , bacause ultramon does n't stretch mirror image to fill monitor : (
i restarted browser , vm , device , etc ... i tried ie and firefox both
no it has 'increased ' , typo error by myself
. at this point maybe the problem is not the jack , but its movement ...
just not there . i uploaded the files to my account ( where they are readily accessible ) , but assumed they would be for all users on the same computer
it was 192.168.1.2 but i changed it to 2.2.2.1 to make it easier .
thats my question . its possible to uninstall xcode by dragging xcode.app to the trash , but that doesnt touch any of the command-line tools .
with one bulk operation
windows 7 , pro version
answering your earlier question : **everything** ( including `netstat -a` ) refers to the **wireless** router . `vlan0` is the wan interface , `eth1` is the ethernet ( lan cable ) , `wl0` is the wifi interface . this is standard dd-wrt naming convention .
lammertsma - it seems that all other image tools ( paint.net , etc all seems to open it fine as a jpeg )
i could n't edit the last question , which in fact was n't asked very good . but this is indeed a valid question and on linux the fan and the heat goes up and i guess this could be solved since alot of people do n't have this at all . trpt4him keep me posted if you find anything
: wan port of r1 connected with external network . lan port # 1 of the r1 connected to wan port of the r2 .

it may not be a tmux problem , but it is a workflow problem . i ca n't be the only one who has this exact problem - which is why i 'm wondering what other people are doing to get around it .
yes , i tested this by putting a script into cron.hourly that writes to a text file .
it 's a raid0 array .
i just want to read first bit of the iso . is it 1 or 0 ? i just need that .
about 6 different pcs . it shows up on my laptop disk manager as unallocated , whereas on a windows 8 pc as raw .
it does n't , even i tried running it with a suffix -- 32bit ! !
im actually ssh'ing into the kali machine in my spare time at work ... so unfortunately i dont have physical access to try this , but this would of been such an obvious solution i probably wouldnt of even thought of regardless . the router itself is a tplink tl-er604w
*edit* -i use windows 7 professional . -i run memtest86 once and it passed . -i run my laptop without battery all the time .
it can get too much charge if it is constantly on charge all the time .
i thought my subject summed it enough that someone reading it would know if they had the experience to help . why is everyone so worried about form ? ask a question , hope to get an answer . i try to answer questions , usually i am beaten by someone else faster . i did n't put in sub : help ! ; if you want to suggest i made a mistake , please suggest a solution . not all of us spend hours a day here , and know the nuance of making a perfect post . i will certainly resist posting questions now , as i sit for 5 minutes wondering what the acceptable subject is . i read the faq b4 , nothing about subjects .
here is the specification of my labtop ? cc=uk & lc ; =en & docname ; =c03892352
correct . this is because the supplied vpn certs were written for linux machines
yes , the router is the gateway , and there is only one subnet . and when it comes to networking , i know enough to get into trouble - no more . ; )
traceroute to a website i receive 30 hops . 1 * * * ... .. 30 * * * . all values are stared .
i 've got the solution for this problem . for those who have the same stuff like me :
i have an bootable windows 7 pen right here i could use it to reinstall windows but if the current windows installation does not appear on grub boot list , if i installed it again probably it wont be there aswell . that will be my last move , if nothing else works .
edge , chrome , mozilla . tried under a different username on my windows 10 pc and get the same results . i have even uninstalled using the receiver cleanup utility and installed again ... many times ...
i would note that it still doesnt explain the change in reserved memory . i just triest 86memorytest and it only sees 12gb for some reason . my mobo does support the config
sap_ui 740 sapk-74008insapui
i updated the question with the only message given by the log file ( except for the request for the favicon.ico file )
true . i had n't noticed that . the `ssh_config` would be `/cygdrive/f/progs/openssh/etc/ssh_config` as far as `ssh` is concerned .
im currently using it to 1024x768 ( 32bit ) ( 75hz ) . same on my led
: actually i get `` bee-boop '' sound but just the disk wo n't get recognized .
i have deployed my test on two computers and used wireshark , the server does n't send anything : - (
i tried a few options : `nat` ( which allowed internet connection ) , and `bridged adapter` ( which did not ) . there are a few other choices , like `nat network` and `internal network` that i have not tried yet .
: it 's actually windows vista enterprise ( 64-bit , sp2 ) , but i changed `editionid` and `productname` in `hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion` from `` enterprise '' to `` business '' . as a test , i did a fresh install of vista enterprise in virtualbox , changed those keys to `` business '' and tried to upgrade to 7. that worked .
it leaves unwanted margins at the top and bottom of paper . it 's his thesis , otherwise it would n't be too big a problem .
yes this is a laptop . it is also dual booted with windows 7. the card works in windows 7
i did reboot but that did n't help
i believe that you are correct . i have tried changing virus checkers , using windows 8.1 and 10 , using word 2013 and 2016 , rolling back video driver to known stable version , and updating the bios . i hope that a new update will be released soon as i have to work around the issue now . ... oh , i need the 64 gb ram for building large solutions , running db servers , and running virtual machines .
edit : so i finished a short run of memtest86 ; about an hour and a half and got through one whole pass and 50 % of another . i 've read that it should run longer , so ill probably turn it on tonight before i go to bed . anyway , that memtest finished with no errors . but , i let my computer go to sleep so i could grab some food and i just got back . i wake it , and boom , critical_process_died . i suppose ill try to grab a fresh dump file . just have to find it .
added info about hardware .
after installing a font , the glyphs appear automatically in firefox without me having to specify the font-face .
toc : that 's what i recommended . the client wants to see the name and final value right next to the line .
yes its also a absolute reference however for whatever weird reason it never changed .
no . the rest is the same speed as it was before .
yes , they 're all gone , and it 's completely disabled as well
network name can not be found .
nope , it is not .
i think it just boots normally . i do n't actually remember that well . i know that it seems to alternate between a normal boot and an automatic repair boot when startup is n't working . i 'll test more tonight .
- computer ethernet port and another ethernet port . why ?
i did say `explorer.exe` and not `iexplore.exe` . it 's called windows explorer for a reason . but it 's also called file explorer officially now in windows 7 or 8 i think . just rule out internet explorer .
hwaddr was just there whenever i first edited the file , and then i just carried it over to the aliases since it complained about wrong hwaddr whenever i tried removing it .
no and unfortunately i 'm now in another city so ca n't continue looking . for now i 'm assuming this is due to hardware damage as suggested but everything else is working fine .
`k` did it ! would you like to make this an answer so i can accept ?
restart.sh is the name of the script .
no error . sorry . updating .
i was merely browsing the internet -- and not even actively so . i was reading a static web page that had already loaded , with no clicks , keypresses , or requests being filed . i 'm editing the question now to improve it , as i 'm really asking if there is some type of log of program runs/initiations , and specifically , a command prompt .
i have not manually or knowingly changed any settings in the firewall .
hi ! this is my router : tp-link td-w8968 ( it ) modem router wireless n 300mbps , adsl2+ , fast ethernet , usb
i do n't think it 's like schedule . but i ca n't reproduce that on particular schedule . after this question , still file intact . i 'll update status very soon if anything change . file permissions are normal .
i am a newbie to terminal environment.there was n't any mention of /dev/sdb when i ran the above command and it did not return the prompt.i guessed it as /dev/sdb from the output of 'dmesg | grep scsi ' in which there was a line 'sd 6:0:0:0 [ sdb ] attached scsi removable device ' .
, no , i want to be able to disable video playback , not autoplay , just no play .
thank you , that works fine . its been years since i used batch files and forgot that .
i have a similar issue with the wordpress code editor . ( it says to make the file `` writeable '' . )
let 's take xp and above . i do n't think xp has a much different ras interface in this regard then older nt based windowses .
no , actually to save a keystroke . however , when editing ( in my current situation ) 500 photos , i 've to press the key combo 500 times . therefor looking for some automation . : )
- that option is to create a new partition
starting in safe mode fixed everything .
could n't reach them !
how can i do this ?
oops ... it 's an exim version 4.85
i got iwatch up and running with an smb share in xubuntu , this should suffice for 3 users or so . i have n't had a chance to max out the job requests .
i 've added an image of what happens when i open a youtube video . i know the principle of enabling the addons one by one . the problem is that this method does n't work . say i do this alphabetically , then up til a certain addon , it works , then it stop working . so you think that this last addon is the problem . i disable that addon , but no , it does n't work . then i disable the previous , no change . then i disable all manually , but not via the safe restart , no change , no video .
i am not aware of any other user . i built and loaded the machine myself . i did n't know there was an administrator account . i think it 's grayed out because the primary drive is ssd and should never be powered down .
thank you for responding . not duplicates . codes to use in place of the proper name .
it says ` ] : makefile script , ascii text , with very long lines`
ca n't exclude . today i saw not only java.exe reads it but chrome also .
no it 's simple headphones .
i use a free host online , and am not using a dedicated computer or server to host , so i do n't know , but i highly doubt ssh is possible . is this required ?
they seem to spawn the same thing .
yes with vga cable . i did right click ... . but how can i know if it uses a native resolution ?
yes , i am , i forgot to mention that .
there 're so many variations on that method that i 'd like confirmation from several users if possible . there are other ways using registry hacks , but these seems to me even more dangerous . no offense , but i do n't take the first thing i read for true unless i can confirm from several sources it is true .
in my c drive ( c : \cygwin\tmp ) tmp folder is empty.what to do for permissions in /tmp folder ?
they are all wireless connections . i do n't think i 've tried it wired .
ssd failure mainly with complete data loss
- brute force , then ? yes , that 's a workable option . though it 's ( or at least , it _should_ be ) more straightforward to just delete the stuff i do n't want . in any case , still think a non-nuclear solution would be a useful thing to have .
i just feel there may be a better way to do it .
, thanks for suggestion , however i just tried and it did n't work . when i 've added it , the keyboard showed up in the settings page , however when i removed it , it stayed in the language bar .
you 're correct . as delivered ( in ubuntu ) there is not clipboard support . but adding this enabled it : set guioptions+=a
yes..my laptop uses this tata photon plus usb device
i do n't know , but if i just click okay , the request does n't seem to go through . and it does n't show up on fiddler either..
tero hello . we do n't know what we do n't know ... : - ( thank you for eliminating things about which i was wondering . indeed , we need to talk to western digital , as they have chosen fat for their file system . at the end of the day , we have spent a hideous amount of time on this , so i 've just sucked it up and gone on with my life , reconstructing the directories as necessary . none of it will matter in another few years anyhow . had there been a way to recover it then fine , but it 's not worth heart and panic attacks . kind regards , andy
to be clear , pictures are sorted under `c : \users\\pictures\` by year , then date ; for example : `c : \users\\pictures\2012\2012-10-20` , these show , however those in `c : \users\\pictures\2012\2012-10-29` do not , despite coming from the same camera , being in the same format , thumbnails working in exporer , the pictures opening in the pictures app via a double click in explorer , and windows media centre having no problems . i have tried excluding the pictures library , and reincluding it , but that had no effect . it has taken three or four reboots for even the folders to show up in the app , but it reports them as empty
the gateway/firewall is configured with a separate port for the 3 vlans , the wired lan and the internet . the lan has it 's own switch with any wired computer . the switch for the vlans has 3 ports that are exclusive to each of the vlans . these ports are then connection to the gateway/firewall . all other ports on the switch are tagged for all 3 vlans . the various wireless aps are connected to these ports on the switch .
yes , my account is the administrator account . for what it 's worth , using ccleaner to uninstall gives an error of `` error - could not find the file specified . ''
i almost know nothing to photoshop . how i can know what kind layers they are ? the psd i 've is basically a web template , which has different layers , having images and text etc .
that 's not the issue here . i am just running the crontab command with -u to be explicit . running without has the same effect ...
sorry , you 're right . it 's `` shared '' . i did a typo in posting the question . thanks !

i was looking for a windows solution , i should have mentioned that .
: this is debian stable with all packages up to date ( `openssl ( 1.0.1e-2+deb7u11 ) ` from 15 jun 2014 ) . the openssl package is patched with heartbleed fix :
there are 2 such scenarios i found just checking a couple rows randomly .
: all games ... all games were accelerated 4x ... i figured out why . i had the onboard video card booting first and then the pcie card was also enabled , so it made everything super fast somehow . when i changed the order to use pcie first , everything returned to normal .
thanks @ legoscia , that did it .
, this is eset nod32 antivirus . i 'll try to install the updates , but i doubt this will help ... just general windows and ie updates .
, though i may be wrong
basically i have an app called discord which detects games by reading active .exe files . if there 's for example a `` minecraft.exe '' , it will say `` playing minecraft '' . so it 's expected to show the name of the game whenever you run it , something that does n't happen for minecraft . i decided to just create my own .exe file then to explore this further and and discord indeed shows the name when running the fake minecraft.exe . the whole problem with minecraft not using an .exe in the first place is obvious , as it is a game made using java . i was just curious .
eh , as in does it exist ? or as in where is it located ? i do n't get what you mean , its located in the same directory as the bash_profile , and contains the following , # source global definitions if [ -f /etc/bashrc ] ; then . /etc/bashrc fi
i use the touch pad but that is a good idea . how would i disable the touch pad , but not the track point ?

permanently i what i am looking for .
rm -rf * would work on local systems , but i have to delete the files over ftp ( there is no ssh ) . i thought to use lftp or ncftp but i am not sure which one to choose . thanks : )
no , i have n't found a better way .
i do n't know , but suspect that `overwrite [ whole ] disk` overwrote that as well when installing openbsd on its own .

well if i have a folder with some script files their are a ton of extra files that dont go away afterwards , is there a way to hide them ? thanks
sony vaio support site .
it does not work with pia disabled , unfortunately . i actually uninstalled pia entirely and tested it that way as well . further , things work fine with pia disabled or enabled if using my wireless connection through android 's usb tethering to act as a surrogate for a wifi card .
each line is 1000 characters long . each column is anywhere from 1 to 50 characters long . i do n't know the exact column count yet.i would have to manually count them in the massive standards document .
the result of `ifconfig -a` shows a `eth0` and a `lo` ( with descriptions ) . is that what you mean ?
normally , the donwloadded stuff comes in th tab 'download ' , but i ca n't find new downloaded stuff there . surfing the internet goes fine .

i looked in the apache2 folder in /usr/local/ and found a /modules directory with all the modules in it . so it seems like they are there how would i go about building/installing the version again ?
thanks for the comments and sorry for the confusion : i mean the xml format you get when doing save as word xml document ( see clarification ) .
all of them are : i think i checked them to enable the boot menu options .
the new adapter was just something my friend tried . and yes , the behavior is the same when starting off the battery alone .
it does n't work even when i use `ftp localhost`
answer to comment : asus n71jq unknown time , but it seems differents if i look at the last entry in the logs i have no information to tell you , that 's why i ask for tool and not the solution . i usualy go to sleep after midnight , but i have avg free edition as antivirus

where/how would i check this ?
, nothing except the event for the hang
yeah i think it 's indexed . how can i verify ? i tried your example , but it found 0 results ( when `iatric-scz5` is in some emails )
mkv files are able to be seen and played by wmp . however , since posting this question , i have found that it was a problem with the k-lite codecs . the new windows 8.1 wmp could not play the mkv files . i have since been updated with the new k-lite mega codecs , and the mkv files are now able to be seen and played .
nope . that was the first thing i checked . i even reset the user 's password .
ok , i will try to do this .
i 'm using windows 7
hi thank u for the reply . i mean i want to use a single usb device that every time i put my usb the system recognizes it . if someone else put their own usb i do n't want them to work .
ah , i misread the references there . thank you for pointing that out !

i was using putty 0.62 , tried with putty 0.65 but same error . winscp version i am using 5.7.6

- i ca n't find them in the list of patches installed by microsoft however that is not to say they could not be installed if they had been included in service pack 2 .
normally nothing . i use another program . it uses ctrl+f12 to make some action . so these shorcuts conflict . i need to remove this conflict .
( there is search tools , but that does n't work , just refreshes the page ) .
if i do `sudo kextstat | grep -i wwan` i get nothing . i mean , not even sure that't kext i want , but it does look suspicious .
well i do n't log in to x11 manually , but my gnome login is a normal user . does this answer your question ?
*in response to redgrittybrick 's comment : * the purpose is to maintain a complete , automatic ( offline ) backup of every message to pass through the account . for various reasons , certain messages may not remain on the imap server , but do need to be kept in offline storage .
: ty . it were the memory module .
: to be honest , i do n't have a clear idea . it 's something like a pppoe connection which comes through a cat5 from my isp . if its connected to my pc , i need to dial and enter my credentials , but when it 's connected to the router 's wan port , the routers handles the dialing .
i think the normal power adapter box connected to this should do the trick , no ?
mine has 1gb memory .
nope , sorry : (
i have a key from my uni for avira antivir professional 10.2
yes , exposed to the evil outside . the fact is that are 2 vm machines which host django , nothing on the other 5. how can i check the last modified files ?

this is service pack 2. techie007 makes a good point although the outgoing traffic to this ip would be udp so i do n't need acknowledgements ( as far as i know ) . although that would explain why i was n't able to ping that ip once i blocked the incoming traffic ...
yes , i opened the command prompt as administrator
, i will try to copy an example of what i am trying to do :
yes . i reread the story of the tabnabbing attack for one , and task manager often shows tabs accessing network resources , and really , if i 'm not using them , then why even bother ? much more to the point , i do n't need a 'reason ' to want to alter behaviours that i find unpleasant on my system . i 'm open minded though . is there a specific reason why i should not contest this loss of autonomy ?
i do n't know , i just installed the cygwin with all the devel and linus packages
now , the link is included in my question

the laptop is an acer k56ca laptop . and sawdust i thought about it but i ca n't risk it . the laptop is under a year old but is excellent i would definitely recommend it and would buy it again but i 'll have to deeply look into whether this is a recurring problem as i have done extensive research to no avail .
lame is called from within another application as a shell command . audacity has n't been considered as i thought it did n't have a useful command line interface . i surely may reconsider !

a couple of ipods , wii , and a couple of work laptops . it 's the ipods and the wii that i 'd like to use the opendns dns service .
well , now it 's too late to tell : ) . i think i left it as the default . is the default read only ? i read this but it does n't look definite :
i will , but ca n't afford the time right now . this is baked into a complex dev ops strategy
edit : doing alt+f4 does n't work . this just minimizes the window . ( it seems that it does the same as `` close window '' . ) edit 2 : i should have said this at the beginning . i am using skype portable version 6.18 .
these are good links , thank you . i am only running out of resources on the host . i am not trying to address a bug , just the greedy resource behaviour of an os that assumes it is the only os on the box . dyncache looks like one answer although it is an extraordinarily ugly hack . generally speaking , we need the functionality of rammap 's empty menu in a command line tool .
the idea is to confirm authentication via an external module without the user to exist as a local account .

this is a text field . and i could write a simple script to do it but would rather use an application to click a few buttons which is why i asked for this type of solution .
hidden files are all viewed by default , these are phantom files created at random
i have written code , but it doesnt work as intended . it deleted all files instead of just the old ones . i intended to delete the last element until the number of files goes below the limit . is there an easier way to do this process ?

oliver - i determined it is a dns issue because when trying to load pages i get a dns error page from chrome . when using a direct connection to my modem , the internet works . when i try to use my router , wired or wirelessly , i ca n't connect to the internet . what are the wan settings i am looking for in the router ? i do not know exactly what you mean . i have tried alternate dns servers . i have set the static dns in the router settings to both googledns and opendns and changed the dns setting under the tcp/ip config window to use those addresses .
- no idea , i just download the drobo app for either mac or pc and it just magically works . how can i check this ?
theuser1024 : are you saying the noise is occurring because of applications i have installed ? !
yes , did reboot but it continue to eat cpu
it 's not me . i am just handling damage control . anyway , i 've figured it out .
i tried browsing to the folder under `c : \users\joe\appdata\local\temp` extracted by logitech gaming software 's installshield installer to update the gamepad 's driver through device manager , indicating that device manager should check subfolders for an appropriate driver too : there are `.ini` and `.sys` files aplenty in and beneath that folder ; but device manager reports that it can not find an appropriate driver for the gamepad in any of those folders .
no . its my personal desktop at home .
no just the intel 4000 ( i have actually connected one monitor before that just worked fine )
i did n't know it . could you explain what are the reasons ?
i have n't gotten home from work yet to try the direct ip addresses

yes , you could say that i want to sync with outlook ( i 'd prefer staying native though - mac mail 4.5 ) , but it has to be an exchange connection , as on the iphone and ipad ... i do n't want an imap or a pop connection , and i do n't want three separate connections for mail , contacts and calendars ...

kard , thanks for an answer . did not understand what you wrote about boot ? i suppose you suppose me to get rid of vista and ie ? may be of microsoft at all ? good idea , but not now . i would not want to downgrade to ie8 . i know how to , but with microsoft it is not easy . in other words , you have no answrer . will wait for somebody else .

i tried and it says `can not open file`
yes , work perfetly

- if after buying a harddrive , i delete all the software from it ( as i usually do ) , and keep using it that way ... and something happens to it ... after taking it to a `` recovery shop '' would they be able to get my data off of it ? unscrambled ( if i have n't setup anything in that regard ) ? in other words , can i use it as a regular drive , so it does n't modify my data in any way ?

update : after reading all answers and comments i decided to use dynamic disks and go with raid 5. the reason why i decided this in first place was to solve problems with my main computer and its constant disks consistency checks , lost files or even partitions so raid 5 it is . for now i will stay with software raid and i will see how it works for me . if i performance will be an issue i will switch to hardware raid as zoredache and molly suggested .
yes you are right . let me clarify . i found the driver for windows 7 , 8 , 8.1 and 10 but not for windows server 2012 r2 which i need it for .

indeed : the = disappeared when i composed my question ( which is ironic given what i am trying to do ! ) . i modified my post . and yes , i am working on dos as stated in the post .
i have n't solved this problem . and i can not reproduce the symptom since i formatted and reinstalled windows vista ( for other causes ) .
several 100 to a few 1000 requests . i currently have a 4 core server that runs at about 1-2.0 la and everything loads instantly . but yea , without any actual benchmarking i guess it would be hard . running services would be apache , nginx and mysql . i 'm thinking that as the server gets more and more loaded the more cores will come into play so twice the requests get served even though it is slower .
ideally it should be just the file metadata ( e.g . path , size , last-modified ) rather than a copy of the directory as that 'd be too large . rsync definitely has this timestamping functionality though - but i hope to find it as a standalone tool ( the unix philosophy ? )
hi ivan thanks but this is unlikely . the hdd is in perfect form and as mentioned in the description , i have uninstalled already antivirus . not sure what else should be uninstalled . also 'other components ' it 's a bit vague . i stress that the machine is in perfect functioning state .

i tried searching on the net and on superuser : p i have no idea what software i could use . 7zip seems to not delete anything ever , and winrar seems to only delete if *everything* was successful , so all files at once . if i ca n't find a solution i will have to write it myself in python , which is bad since i 'm almost certainly going to ruin the archive and have to redownload it a bunch of times : )

beside thatassist , s1andvaiobuttons do not send any signal too . ( i tested it with autoscriptwriter app ) factory install of windows dose not have thus issue , but i installed an orginal win7 .
i 'm not running any antivirus , i run windows defender once in a while for malware ( none ) and being a software developer , i know how to at the very least take care not to fill my pc with crap/obvious virus . i could run a windows antivirus check , but i 'm almost positive it wo n't find anything .
yes it is intel chipset mainboard . yes i ran the intel chipset driver install that i found on acer website . i am attaching the screenshot of device manager in english , hope you can help me . [ link ] (
that is good advice but i would rather do both , if hell freezes over i still want my cronjobs to run . i 've heard that it can also be because the time/date is n't set when i set the password .
, i actually just did that , and i 've updated my question . ubuntu live cd works like a charm with the new ram , so this has to be windows that is the problem .
it was an isp router but i had had it for longer than the warranty lasted

it is odd , not sure how it could be hardware failure since it was working fine immediately before the re-install . have had 0 issues with machine . i just swapped the ram sticks right now and both work perfect in the 1st slot . just ran mis liveupdate again and have fully updated bios and chipset . i also combed all through the bios for a `` extended memory '' option or even any similar and found none . this issue is really irking me as it seems both ram sticks work just fine and both ram slots worked just fine before re-install . any further thoughts anyone ?

update : there is no error message beyond the simple `` glipper failed to load , delete , or dont delete ''
update : to answer the question , why i want to do this , and not just clear , 1. so many times , i want to see git ( or svn or hg ) diffs and starting over from top is convenient , without bothering where was the command . 2. so many times , the characters on the bash gets eaten up ( and not displayed ) , when used as a server and some python stuff is done ( and i know this is bash 's problem because , zsh and fish dont have the problem ) . only way to get it working back is reset .

if you 're here you 're probably frustrated , so here 's some trivia to lighten your mood : did you know that the first time i tried to use the mouse on a mac it took me **more than 10 seconds** to click a large 32x32 firefox button ( only ~3 of which i spent banging my head on the desk ) ? the muridae challenged quake 3 railgunner that i am , i kept under- and overshooting it .

thank you for your comment , sorry i missed those . i have edited my post with the window managers for each distro . i have been trying to find out whether it is that , but i ca n't find anything rigorous .
( 1 ) 3.1 ( 2 ) i am unsure . `apt-get install gitolite` yields `gitolite is already the newest version` so i am assuming the ubuntu repo .
i 'm not being agressive but i 'd appreciate if you 'd at least read the question before commenting

cpu usage is at a normal operating level , for me and the user users of the machine . nowhere near 100 % . most of the time far below 50 % .
i guess i was n't explicit enough . i was talking about protecting the vm not the osx . i do have anti-virus on the osx but did n't think it checks the vm . thanks radoo for your answer . my problem with mse is that it has failed the av test twice in a row now and has lost it 's certification from av-test certifications .
it 's actually used in a script . it 's used so that the rpm gets installed even if it 's reported to be already installed .
nothing much , just a bunch of system ( ) and some psapi stuff . my point , actually , is to know what could trigger it and not some specific example .
i have n't knowingly overclocked it . i would n't know how . it has pretty much been always like this
the symptoms matched and the solution was the same . shortly before the blue screen apps crashes , the windows bar disapeared abd the icons on the desktop disapeared . resetting the cmos fixed the issue . that 's what lead me to believe it .

i have 6gb ram why ?
how to fix bios ?

the point is that it is also opened on the **left** click , when you move the mouse up without releasing the button . and that sometimes happens , when i want just to switch to another task but do inaccurate click . i never use that menu for anything , so i want to disable it for more robust task switching

edit : i do not want to resume previous power state , my reasoning for doing this is so that my raspberry pi controlled extension lead can both turn on the mains and turn on my pc ( without the raspberry pi being connected to the power switch on the pc ) so that from there i can remote desktop to my pc . all the research i did on this only came up with resuming power state , i could n't find any other information

karan , the windows 8 include directory i mentioned is likely there due to using visual studio 2012 which has windows 8 functionality . ramhound , as noted in the first sentence - i am using windows 7. as to why i mentioned it , i was trying to ensure everyone had as much information as possible . i was not trying to confuse anyone but i clearly did . apologies . do you have any suggestions i might try ?
i guess it was a false reading . one of my scenarios i 'd imagined . not surpised thought that it is probably a false reading . its just suspious that these false readings where happening around the time when i found trojans on my windows partition . it got me thinking while typing this , could this be a new hybrid virus both for windows and linux . anyway , i guess its just a false reading and which is the reason why i asked the professionals online to get their expert opinion so that i can conclude that this is usually a false reading .
yes . it was also before the point when this problem started occurring .
i dunno . even the recovery disc creation manager told me to keep 3 or 4 dvds with me . i bought 4 but required only 3

i 'll try this the next time when it 's corrupted .
the virtual gpus simply do n't support it due to driver issues , an inability to run the windows performance index , or similar problems . i finally just gave up on running aero in a vm and loaded win7 in boot camp , where it works fine .

i followed the steps described in here : i installed the requirements and then created a directory in documents and extracted to archive there , then went to directory where the install.sh file is and typed the command ./install.sh , i followed the instructions all the way through the installation until it completed with sucess .
so why it just become 12mb now ? if the servers in speedtest is slow ? i just want to know why when my speed test is 3.85mb , my download speed is still `` 1780kb/s '' ? ! how it can be possible ? can someone explain this problem ? why when my test speed is 3mb , i can download with 12mb in any server and sites ? ! guys i just ask question , it must have rational reason in ict .
then how do i prevent the same thing happening again ?
no , it does n't say that .
sorry i was not very clear . i used cmd but i have c : \cygwin64\bin in % path % . there is no error . `` chgrp -rv users id_rsa '' actually returns `` group of `id_rsa ' retained as users '' . but `` ls -la '' still shows `` -rw-r -- r -- 1 leyou mkpasswd 1675 jul 1 2012 id_rsa '' . same with chmod , no effect .
i could try , but i do n't know what it eats . that is , if it 's still breathing ...
this folder is a map file folder and the rest of the folders contain music files which i am not able to see..
thanks for your response . yes i do . uac is off ( never notify )
edit : i 'm using windows server 2012 r2 .
schwartz , @ jili sorry for not making the problem explicit . no , the internet is not slow . applications are slow to start up . it got slow over a few years . the overheating is a side-symptom .
yes , definitely . but i guess what kind of fonts people prefer varies from one person to another . compare e.g . the two screenshots in
the bsod error code flashes by so fast that i ca n't write it down . i would just rather do a fresh install on the newly created raid 0 drive ... if only windows would recognize it . i load the drivers pre-install and windows fails to recognize the raid drive . i can deal with doing a fresh install , but the important thing is for windows to recognize the raid disk in the first place . this has been my problem all along .
zsh , but i think i can modify icyrock.com 's answer .
after a lot more research and exploring of the router , i figured out how to reserve the ip for that computer router-side . mostly thanks to maqleod , but thank you everyone for your time .
the theme is n't interfering with it , i tried with just regular aero . it appears that it has to do with files vs programs .
nop , that does n't affect the login window .
i do n't think it is the isp since i do get full speed upon connecting to the modem without the router ...
pc , in this case , but thanks for any suggestions .
: i added my definitions of the given functions to my post .
this happens in the bios too , so the windows related diagnostics may not be related .
bios itself is failing to detect my sata hard disk
they are right now , but overall they will not be . i will be using wifi to connect .
restarting the service did n't seem to help . it 's pure-ftpd , if that makes a difference .
almost 217gb on 283gb total .
- i thought it was a fix , and it does help the pivotchart , but when i copy and paste it , the new fixed chart is showing the zero datapoints anyway . any ideas ?
it 's annoying , i know . yes , i did solve the problem a little while ago and , as usual , i forgot to write down what i did . darn ! i promise to report back if i remember .
no , i 'm asking if is it visually possible to have 4 applications being displayed at the same time at the 4 corner of the screen . it 's *technically* possible since 4k is equivalent to 4 full hd screen , but in practice , placing an app at the top left , and other one at the bottom left , and the same in right : is this something unusable for today 's 4k or largely possible . i ca n't be any clearer !
, thanks for reply , it was windows 7 which my pc came with , when trying to install xp pack 3 i could not see the format option . the drive also came partitioned to 2 drives . so i did not saw `` unpartioned space '' . to install xp i had to creat another partion and install xp on it and to delete the partion where windows 7 installed . i tried latter to repartion my hd but that did not fix the problem and get me a hd with 3 partions and unallocated space
edit : since i ca n't get xampp to work i 'm going to go with mowes portable instead . thanks for your help .
it does n't crash , but is being restarted by the system . event log shows : `` problem event name : apphangb1 ''
sorry , forgot to add that server2 is on a different internal network .
yes , my dvd is an oem version . i 'll try with an english iso and see if it works ; )
i have git installed , yes .
i do n't have any firewall software ( except for windows firewall of course ) no antivirus either . the hosts file was is empty ( no entries )
i would like to save three or four common responses , choose one , make small edits , and post or email the result .
i can add an exception if needed .. it would ne running on my own system , so its okay ..
: yes , i apologize and am terribly ashamed .
virtual would be ideal so i could use existing microphones including a usb mic . if there was a reasonably priced hardware solution i 'd be interested in knowing about it too though .
tried web prxoy , works there . 'netstat ' is giving me syn_sent . tried traceroute , looked up the ip on whois and got the following _error:201 : access denied queries from your ip address have passed the daily limit of controlled objects.access from your host has been temporarily denied._
i would have to check this tonight . the pc went to sleep after idleing for about 90 minutes last night . and immediately woke up like 2 seconds after according to logs . weird
if you want i will be pleased to upvote it .
oh , you are right . this is solution is so simple , but i did not saw it . thank you .
it 's a minitower ...
**event log** this event log holds all relevant errors from when the problems first started . notable error events are a whole bunch of registry 'database ' corruption ( some with usrclass.dat ) , we can see where skydrive took a pitch with its kernelbase.dll ( event 1000 ) and also the 'this app does not support the contract specified or is not installed . ' i got with certain windows 8 apps when they did not start and gave me a dialog box with an error ( event 5973 ) . *i apologize for the somewhat large size , as i am not all that familiar with the windows event logs*
thank-you ! one option to cloning is renaming the domain admin account across all hosts but that breaks many services which need to be repaired . cloning remains a thorny and dissuasive issue . i did get the win 10 apps to work from the domain admin account . briefly , i enabled uac , rebooted , and set uac at the lowest setting then the missing piece - hxxp : //www.virtualizationhowto.com/2015/07/windows-10-edge-opened-builtin-administrator-account/ . i did the secpol setting and the last regedit suggestion . win 10 apps work .
thanks . reading over it made me realise it was a bit of a mess . is your confusion cleared up ? to answer your question directly : i want it to be . the problem i 'm having is that i have to remove it from the series to recolour it ... making life difficult !
do n't understand : it is `./my_script.sh 1` & . or do you ask about the last command before ctrl-c ?
geek , vpn would be limited to speed of their internet connection . they are attempting to eliminate having to pay twice as much for internet . also their file sharing needs require at least 50mbit .
i do n't know what you mean with : put a link with some of your files , could you post a link or something that explains with a little more detail what this approach is about ?
yeah . just my thumb drive with windows 8 on it and my ssd inside my laptop .
no to both questions . however , it might have something to do with programs that have silent events . i just had the problem and brought my winscp into focus . the task bar disappeared , so winscp must have been saying something without making it obvious .
i tested it on my normal desktop machine running on one cpu with multiple cores . i know that each core is also one `` logical '' cpu ; is that what you 're referring to ?
is hourly the default ? my itunes hadnt checked for new episodes despite having recently been awakened from a few days of sleep . on os x 10.6 snow leopard
yes , i did . it failed .
thanks for the folowup . here is the code i was referring to if anyone can help decipher it
i have wmware6.5 only which do not support windows2012 . so i have installed virtual box .
he wants to learn os x. he just does n't want to be forced into it on day 1 , and likes the idea of being able to boot directly into windows so he can still get stuff done in the short-term .
: i 've updated my question to show why i think it 's a memory problem and why swap wo n't work .
, i want to be able copy without having to highlight text . some other key binding will also do .
yes , 2gb of ram operating memory
machine a and e are in 10.6.10 ; machine b is 10.6.20 , c in 10.6.30 and d in 10.6.40
sorry , my problem was partly due to a misconfiguration on my side . i edited the question accordingly to explain my real problem .
linux , see tags
uefi . and what is the difference btw ahci and ide ?
both machines are on the local lan ( the server is a powermac , and its public facing for a few people who use it for testing under the powerpc ) .
believe me it is , check `man` of different commands and you will find it : `cp` , `rm` , `man` , `bash` and so on .
yes , it is .
it works , the screensaver appears correctly with the preview button . it just does n't start by itself without the preview button .
i need the relevant ids of the device , in the question the script try to obtain the second huion device that is id 19 , it is n't visible through udev so i ca n't realize calibration .
reworded question to be more explicit .
yeah , i 'm living in canada . : d
see
i see a post that if you do this solve a problem because the app manually enable for you ! only i did was that
thank you ! i revised /etc/hosts to also have a line for www.youtube.com resolving to 127.0.0.1 and that did the trick .
+1 for cmd+` , i did n't know about it before . thx . but wait , why do n't mac just set the default keyboard for maximize windows instead of `` easy to add '' ? we have one 20 imac here and you expect us to go around and `` easy-to-add '' whenever we need to work on another imac ?
it 's about doing a programming project . one of the project choices is `` web site recognition . ''
no , the yahoo toolbar was not installed .
i 'm using os x .
i 'm on mac os x snow leopard , open office would be a solution . where could i find such a tool in oo @ jay ?
no , there is simplified h2o bios , all i can see about hdd is one line about the initial one .
**edit : ** ( just as a note , my particular application for this , is that i am trying to use a web application at the same time both as a user and as an admin . i ca n't login with both logins at the same time on the same browser because they use session cookies that clobber each other . so i 'm looking for a lightweight browser to run the admin functions that come up occasionally while i am doing mostly user work . )
this is my /boot
i tried other port - they get the same result . @ danielb
- the laptop was indeed new
edited with an example .
thanks darth and ram , i repro 'd and updated the screens using your advice , and it shows basically the same . yes , all taken in same 2 min period
i 'm not sure how to go about it . are you saying to set a start date as today 12/07/16 and to take the 'usage per day ' from the stock on shelf each day ? i have only made very basic macros
i do not want to deactivate hybernate , if i hybernate manually .
thanks . the trust center settings are all set to trust and allow all macros and controls . the developer tab is not required for control buttons on a worksheet to call the vb code when they are clicked only for when adding a control to the sheet . but i tried it anyway to no avail .
that 's what i 'm asking . when i first got the computer i went to `` uefi device configuration '' menu in bios , which showed me the three items i mentioned above , and intel rst was working . by the way , turns out it 's not a hybrid drive , there is a separate ssd in it based on info on hp 's webpage : hard drive - 500gb 5400rpm hard drive with hp protectsmart hard drive protection , solid-state drive - hard drive acceleration cache ( 24gb solid-state drive cache ) with intel rapid start technology and intel smart response technology

yes mate . i have other devices and they all are fine
i think no . i am a simple user , know very little about hardware . it shows only intel ( r ) g41 express chipset wddm 1.1 in my display adapters..
it is a system hidden file .
no its a localhost ...

the bios registers the hdd as plugged into a data slot , it 's just not bootable from boot options
this is during **animation** of the shape .
from the output of parted i thought i did have it formatted and as ext4 , but apparently not , this was a new partition so using mkfs was not harmful in my case . mkfs.ext /dev/sdb1 was the fix and then i was able to issue my mount command
yes 192.168.192.158 is my own pc
i checked the files in adobe bridge cs5 and they are all still there . if utorrent checked for the files but they were non existent , it would say that the files had to be re-downloaded , or had just never been downloaded .
: yes , i 'm sure , the installed one is `xf86-input-synaptics` .
i want to understand the `/add-package` command better . that is n't specific to any one package . it could be any package i want to add ( or re-add ) in future . if this happens again , i want to understand what did n't work this time . my questions above , on the use of `dism /add-package` , try to sum up the points that i could n't get right or figure why they were n't working for me , and the help i 'd like to ask for .
name is bsnl evdo rev a usb data card , model : ue100
its already in my laptop when i got it..just wmp . i 've got itunes , quicktime player and gom player . i got the gom encoder but i do n't really use it though . the file i downloaded is an mp3 file
trueamerican420 , it is used for file sharing
sadly , no . i ended up formatting the drive a few days after posting this .
it 's short for `` thinkpad buttons '' . it 's one of the tools under linux that can make thinkpad special buttons work . the only one if you need osd though .

right now it seems all other usb devices have no problems at all .
yes , it 's for surround sound
sorry , i did n't measure when plugged in using a cable . i 'm also not sure what service i am subscribed to . afaik i just picked the most basic service at $ 29.99/mo in my area . i 'll see about hooking up my pc to the actual cable next .
networking is ok. after creating a new pptp vpn connection , a new icon shows up under `` dial-up '' including a red cross and the text `` unavailable - device missing '' .

well it seems the activation code ( cough , cough ) does n't work anymore ...
i do n't know because i do n't have a dvi cable or adapter at the moment as will suggested below . i guess the solution is to buy a vga-to-dvi converter and plug my second monitor into the dvi slot on my graphics card .
edit - the powersupply has an amber led which lights up when it has power , and turns green when the computer is on . in the current state , the led stays at amber , and nothing happens when i press the computer power button . no fans , no hd
as noted , vlc is unable to play the file .
may i ask why this question already has 4 close votes ? @ lunixbochs : i edited my question to include windows in the tags
**update** the exact model of the ssd is : *kingston ssdnow v100 256gb* it claims 250mb/sec read and 230mb/sec write speeds
is there any way of adding about 100ms ping to ones connection ?
note : this is **not** the original question , however i decided to completely revise the topic and main post to match the posted answers for googlers sake instead of deleting this questionoriginal topic : midi cable bandwidth software emulation ?
in other words how can i determine which version of directx is installed on an unknown computer ?
yes , it matter because if a file is not contiguous then grub4dos or any other loader can not boot from it .
: i put the computer to sleep via
yep , any tool that can do this ( while being lightweight ) would be fine , thank you
i 'm sorry it 's been corrected .
i have watched for running apps , watched task manager for 'spikes ' that timed with skips in the voip , no luck . i even resumed a call after a fresh reboot .
copy and paste , as well as select , but not button click .
she wants to backup only the external hd . the os is a windows flavor ( probably 7 ) .
if it 's impossible , then let 's discard edward and tim , i do n't really understand why it 's impossible though , ca n't i do ( if number in the middle then not a word ) or something like that with regex ? i 'm also able to run multiple commands does n't have to be one in case that helps
how can i enable
- attaching the microsd card to another computer worked well , and i was able to perform the resize . now i need to do it on a beaglebone with emmc . the beaglebone has 512 mb of ram , and my compiler frequently dies because [ cc1plus runs out of memory ] ( ( one source file is a real monster ) .
yes a web page or any scrolling window . i do not prefer specifying the application whose window i 'm trying to capture since i 'm looking for a general solution . i know there are browser plugins that capture whole page but i 'm looking for a way to do it using windows snipping tool .
1st display is n't marked as my main display . but thats where all the flash videos decide to play fullscreen on . my second display is where i want them to go .
i 'm not sure what your question means , but if it means what i think it means , i have no idea of the answer . : ) i do n't think i 've installed cygwin , but i do n't know how to find out . i 'm running unix2dos from the standard windows command prompt . the executable resides in a directory where i keep utilities like that .
the page file is on the c drive .
only on mounted directory .
try using tmux instead . worked for me .
i wrote how the problem was solved , but i need to wait 2 days before i check it as 'solved ' .

it 's the space shown on my computer when i insert a usb . after that , it will load automatically and finally says usb not recognized .
to save electricity and we turn off ac and fans at night so also to avoid damage because of heat .
**update : ** i have tried many samples , but here is a link to the basic starter kit example . it is supposed to work on windows 8 , vs 2012. i just get `` ( incompatible ) ''
i found some code which was able to generate the folders in cmd but , uh , lost the code and i 'm on a work system that 's fairly locked down , so i ca n't even check history to find the page i got it from and i ca n't find it again . : (
i already stated last time battery were changed in my post . perhaps you missed that line .
unfortunately not , i gave up on using contract mode for a while now .
/var/log/messages showing nothing about mdmonitor
ati drivers does n't change resolution until monitor detected . this is fine . no crash in event viewer . this problem is not dependent from motherboard because i changed it .
on video board ? - yes used , by my customer , which decided to not wait until i repair it , and go for new one . this monitor is 5 years old . no , it is not shipped .
there 's only 1 drive in the nas , so i really doubt there was any raid going on ... ( it 's a 2tb wd `` mybook live '' drive ) .
from the comments : `` sorry - lotus notes version 8.3.5 linda ''
sorry , no solution yet . i stopped using `hyper-v` in the end . it would be nice to learn why this happened though ...
i 'm not talking about actually logging in as another user , but just falling back to the users selection screen . still , swapping all my programs to disk sounds a pretty reasonable cause for the slowdown . is there any documentation or other material that confirms this ?
mostly yes , the first of it . for example , i deleted the history of youtube by mistake . i search all urls which contains '*www.youtube.com/watch* ' for open them . i will open each of them for a long time by hands . this extension : is n't bad , but there 's no option which i 'm looking for .
it 's a vps , so i do n't have physical access to it if that 's what you mean . any clues would have to be gathered over ssh . as for looking on the server over ssh , i do n't really know where to start .
telnet does n't work before browsing network share . remote desktop has stopped connecting ( it was fine a minute ago ) so i 'm not sure about the `` after . ''
speakers are still on , but volume is on mute . can cpu utilization be one of the reasons ?
update : chkdsk did finish , but almost immediately the disk became corrupted again . rather than run chkdsk again , i used testdisk ( ) to copy the files .
it 's a usb device .
realy strange i have just pluged a live dvd with linux and bios start fast without eny problem ... .. i 'm thinking that may be the batery of the matherboard
, it messes up the alignment of the line , there are also other lines , above and below that line that also get affected .
, i 'd like to apologize but i didnt know how superuser works . trying to find a solution , i found this forum and i made my question .
: the directories `bin` and `extra` do n't exist . i updated my question to reflect which directories i created . as you see i created them from scratch . they 're empty .
in filezilla you can see the transfer progress and the transfer instantly hits 100 % and then stalls untill the 20 second timeout as is default in filezilla . the file is properly uploaded though ... even if i increase the timeout to 60 seconds it 's the same , just takes longer for it to time out .
update i read the comments on partition type and i will check on that . is there an easy way to change the partition type ? i did a fresh install of windows on the ssd .
- yeah , the switch has brand new wiring that i am using .
thanks frank . it 's the third one : always containing a virtual directory called /get/
: i 'm using windows . those thousands of files in the playlist are scattered around dozens of folders and it will be complete waste of time to do it manually . i 'm searching for a tool that can automatically read the mpcpl playlist and copy songs from it to a certain location .

: i checked event viewer and there 's nothing helpful there . the only event generated is the one created when the computer recovers from an unexpected shutdown , which has not information other than 'hey , that happened' @ david : nope , i never got that far
please , do n't focus on the errors listed . i need to know command line sample for : ffmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple utf-8-encoded ini-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer . fyi : windows 7 x64 : ffmpeg-git-1d0ae92-win32-shared ffmpeg-git-1d0ae92-win64-shared ffmpeg-git-1d0ae92-win32-static ffmpeg-git-1d0ae92-win64-static the x64 version of ffmpeg failed on some files at all : ffmpeg.exe has stopped working windows dialog ... so , i can not use ffmpeg for convert , i would like to use it just for transferring the tags ( wma to id3 tags ) .
yes , very definitely different subnets . could this be a firewall issue ? i 'm not using the built-in one . like maybe the firewall resets itself when it sees that something nic-related changed ? or the virtualbox bridged network driver ?
yea i know but i ca n't remember what it was : ( - i was hoping that somebody else has done a similar hack - it was only one or two entries that i changed so i was hoping that someone else might recognize it right away -

sorry marco , no solution yet . : (
, yes . i use linux mint , the remote computer is windows server 2012 , so i created this for hyper-v virtual machine to be accessed remotely by a friend of mine , so he can not change the files in the real machine . connect to the local machine hyper-v is easy , i just do not know when the connection is remote outside the network ( which is my case ) , because it involves ip settings . now i just saw the email setup they gave me 3 ips , i 'll try right now , for one fixed ip on the virtual machine and try to connect , if it works , i leave the answer here later .
outlook is installed on the remote server , but is not published as a remoteapp .
no , i have used the **import and export settings ... ** in the tools menu .
nope it does n't : (
i do n't think that 's locking up ; a standard shutdown retains the time , but pulling out the battery of course ; resets it . ( unless i got the definition of 'locking up ' wrong )
there is absolutely no overlap , i know it can be done , my query is simple where do we find the media for this , ms ?
do n't think so . the millisecond i start panning the sound starts . stops the millisecond i stop panning . could it speed up and slow down that quickly ? or is the fan given a signal to speed up the second you do something intense and that signal is causing the motor to make that noise for some reason ?
then how to solve this problem..any one known please help..
i tried both nat and bridged ... on nat , the network activity indicator ( the one showed by vbox ) does n't show any incoming traffic ( no green blinking light ) . on bridged it does . although the problem is exactly the same with both configs .
does not appear to work , tried before asking question : )
, i was recently frequently rebooting my os due to upgrading , i 'll paste again once the issue comes up ; )
i just use the system `` cp '' command .
maybe cpu is the bottleneck here . i did some testing with rsync and large files , and the cpu load provided by the web-interface went over 80 % . i also found out that using the option `w` seems to transfer whole files seems to improve the performance a bit - even if there is just one file which is not present at the target .
attach how ? no prompts , just an error message ( i will post that when i get back to the system ) . permissions are fine . nothing is readonly at ntfs and everything is dull access for everyone at share level
this issue occurred for files containing codes of any language . for example c++ , if it makes the question better defined .
% temp % ( c : \users\user\appdata\local\temp )
i 've been having difficulties with my guake install , so i was hoping to install from source so that i could ( possibly ) debug it .
how would i find out if my system is compromised ? what should i look for ?
it does , even with the default colorscheme
wjen i used c : \users\ % userprofile % \appdata
the dhcp server has always been turned off .
i think i tried that , i opened computer and entered into the bar ftp : // username : password @ hostname and i was able to connect to it , but it would n't allow me to make file edits without downloading the file first . it was pretty much another filezilla .
no - the only large opening is the front swinging door of the cabinet .
thanks that you 've inserted my image here . right now i am selecting a floor from b1 dropdown , later unchecking 2/3 item from location filter . i have to work twice to print every individual floor . i do n't know is it possible using vba or not . please help me as i m not familiar with those script .
i meant to say `` done '' to providing a sample . i am still in need of an answer
i removed the drivers before installing the card - when no drivers are installed and the 650 is alone , i get output on the screen , but no 3d accleration ( indicating pass-through only ) - when i install the driver , nothing displays on screen - it is then that i reinstalled the 8800 alongside the 650 in order to get that screenshot . ( the screenshot was taken with both the 8800gt and the 650 gtx installed in pci-e slots in the system ) .
only the ip address of the machine .
i did the batch script approach but it did not change anything . the runas dialog still appears .
it 's 2gb seconds after boot . if i go to the task manager as fast as possible i can sometimes see it filling up quickly .
oh , man , this is even eviller : d i originally thought of funny name.txt , but this way , if i hide extensions , they wo n't find out until they actually send the files to someone : d
i 'm using sort ( gnu coreutils ) 8.5 .
i have a c # program that will mount azure storage on the mount point . once i run this code , the permissions gets screwed up like this . i can not do an ls or cd to that mountpoint .
windows 7 of course , i thought this forum was for windows 7 anyway .
ok , you answered both on my questions , thank you very much !
edit : the laptop wo n't turn on . i 've tried several different power adapters . edit : i 've done it with and without the battery .
the wireless adaptar is a intel centrino wireless-n 1000 and the only drivers i found on the intel website were for windows 8.1 .
what do you mean ? are you asking what the sequence code it ?
os x 10.7.4
popped in the snow leopard install disc and got this message when trying to run the installer . **you ca n't use this version of the application install mac os x with this version of macosx . you have install mac os x 23.1 . ** : (
: that 's the problem it 's difficult to make complex edits without side effects using a regex . in mac os x , for example , there 's the `defaults` command line utility for making edits to mac os x 's xml settings files simple , and no risk ( compared to regex ) of obliterating other user settings .
edit 2 : i 've just used a `` usb to lan '' dongle connected to a usb port . now , my mini server do n't reboot anymore and works properly with a low lan speed . so the problem was on my lan card but only when i copy/move files via samba or nfs !
ramhound - company ... .
no enclosure . windows 8.1. ctrl-c - > ctrl-v .
yeah , this is normally `=== > ` . maybe it 's a `` starting to write but failed '' line ... dunno .
hello magicandre , that is what were trying to find out , what tablet to use . we finally contacted the manufacturer of various tablet to ask wether it was possible . the biggest problem is like journeyman said is finding the proper drivers . we now have 1 new tablet ( acer iconia ) which should be able to run windows7 . but they also said that the warranty will drop if we do , but thats a chance we will take since the alternatives are atleast 2 to 3 times more expensive .
* '' file transfer server could not be started or it exited unexpectedly . exit value 0 was returned . most likely the sftp-server is not in the path of the user on the server-side '' * i am able to connect through ssh to this vm but not able to connect to sftp for file transfer .
i am at j.still have a long way to go .
yes . setting both to 300 , the window still can not be made wider than the width of the monitor .
opening applications , using them , everything just lags as if the processor was bogged down , but it is n't .
as mentioned , p < file does not work .
daniel , thanks for pointing me to that post - it pointed me to the answer given below about making the changes in all hosts . * files in /private/etc/
i use 400 watt power supply [ vip 400 gold ] . the card was tested at customer care center and it worked there fine .
i have a table in a word document with all its values based on one colour , however this has to be done for 8 colors . instead repeating myself , i want something that will change values when a color is picked .
would you mind elaborating ? as i said setuidgid not enough cos i need env . or you mean that flag on runuser ?
thank you very much hennes , i really need to understand if the physical memory addressed by the memory bars of a pcie device resides in the device itself , is it part of the ram , both , none ? when we refer to memory as a whole , is it the sum of ram + devices memories ? the answer ultrasawblade gave seems to go in that direction , but i 'm not sure
yes both interfaces are on different network basically interface 1 is isp1 and usb device is isp 2
my hd is 200 gb out of which 160+ is filled . to convert into ntfs i 'll have to empty my drive/partition as it will format my whole drive/partition . so i 'm not looking to do that . correct me if i am worng .
switching vs-versions is not something we can do lightly ; we need to do it ( as i understand it ) more or less on a company-wide basis . we are , however , in the process of switching to vs2008 , but i still need to be able to build with vs2005 now and then .
... i 'm starting to get the feeling that you are quite involved with vim ?
the `tc` [ command ] ( seems whats needed the only problem is it seems way to out of my league : (
at school i was n't the smartest ; everyone knew javascript and i did n't . now i shall take me revenge . but seriously , i need this to test some html and css rendering of already written javascript pages . and instead of weeding out the javascript , i 'd rather disable it 's execution .
windows is both , the server and the clint os .
: yes still not working
os = windows xp
this is a student dormitory which belongs to the `` munich scientific network '' and people tend to over-complicate things here .
that is an option . i would like to find out why though , and i 'm not in the office that often .
it seems fine if i roll back the driver . though it could be just me experiencing a placebo effect of sorts . i ca n't seem to convince myself one way or another . some of my pictures especially look definitely redder , but on second look i ca n't tell .
oh my goodness hahaha sorry mate i am so in my little objective c world i forgot this was super user lol
: it is after a fresh install . i did n't install yet any of the drivers or other software besides xp . @ hyperslug : i can not see the error from the blue screen . i get a blue screen and a fast restart .
yes i absolutely did .
it plays the vocals on the left side and most of the bass i 've bin playing minecraft and it works just fine but when i use the usb headset
from which u connect internet..i.e usb data internet card .
it happens with newly-created documents .
that 's why i gave a very specific example . i fully understand that any custom app on top of the framework will have it 's own issues . i 'm trying to understand how much confidence people have in the framework itself .
where should i have selected the model then ? when installing the video drivers ? the atk package in the link i provided does not seem to care about which model i 'm using .
thank you very much . ? did the trick
: the best pic i found so far
yes , there are lots of files there including zip files ( visible when i do n't use the wildcard )
do n't want the user to
i thought that `` unlocking '' the drive does n't decrypt the entire drive . if that was the case would n't the process take a very long time for large drives ? does n't bitlocker do encryption/decryption on the fly ? i 'm thinking if the os goes to trim the drive it will be unable to see anything as garbage that it can collect ...
i 'm using compiz and sun java
: as far as i can see , no type of filed . i tried the alt + f9 to see the field type , but nothing happens to my pictures
found a solution for the second question ... sorry for being absent so late ... u just have to cascade proxies for that ... install squid3 on your system and configure it to use with your wifi ip , chain it with the parent proxy u want to authenticate ... .now u just have to put your systems ip in the proxy settings on the phone ... most apps will work with this
just a unix/linux sysadmin
i would like to create the graph in excel
**edit-** okay , i tried switching the omnibar 's settings to `` slim '' mode ( it was on `` rich and slim '' previously ) . this causes the dropdown suggestions to be simple urls , and this improved the responsiveness . it 's still not quite as fast as , say , chrome 's `` omnibar '' . is this just a limitation of the plugin ? my connection speed is fairly fast , rated at 15mbps . google 's own ajax suggestions are very quick , so it 's not a network limitation . this same thing has occurred on previous ubuntu systems that i 've used , and i 've used the omnibar plugin every time .
, yes , i was expecting to see what i would be viewing if i were sitting down at the xubuntu machine . i was under the impression that tightvncserver on linux would work in a similar fashion as it does in windows ( i have done this fine windows to windows and linux to windows , but ca n't seem to get it right windows to linux ) .
windows 7 , sorry for not mentioning that .
, fixer1234 - thanks , it worked perfectly . although as fixer1234 pointed , now i 'm wondering what is the use of grouping the dataset ?
using a shell script
00:26:03 : xx : xx : xx < -- in every intel wifi card it starts with 00:26 ...
not that i am aware of , how can i verify that the isp does n't ?
before adding the 2nd nic to the home server , it was on the same network within the same ip range so then i could remote desktop to it using the machine name . now that it is in a different ip range the name resolution does n't work anymore . i 've also noticed that when connecting to it via its main ip from the onboard nic , the remote desktop session is pixalted with blotchy block on screen on unresponsive . when i remote desktop to the new ip of the 2nd pci express nic added , it works as before , but i can not use the server name anymore .
yes ! just like that
in order of appearance : i do n't know what you mean by that . the version is windows 10. it 's local gp , that 's all i know .
thanks for your reply only b and c use the same dns
different locations remote from each other but using same isp . most-likely both computers are connected to man or vpn .
i can watch youtube , but not any live stream or other flash videos .
i connect to the internet
no , no security warning . the weird thing is that one day it just started working , and it 's worked every day since then except for once . i still have no idea why .
as psychodata said i have more than one nic on the remote pc . i thought i could use one of the others to disable and bring back the one i need
a pe instance would work from a technical point of view , but there are legal reasons that necessitate avoiding it , that i ca n't get into
procedures do n't allow us to update that server until all the vms on the box have been tested before hand . we are n't scheduled to do that upgrade for a few weeks and we 're just trying to get this one vm to run .
i meant the speaker is not in mute
well the mother board is intel d945gcnl and idk the make bios
yeah it 's got a link , but it does n't take me to the line number just the top of the file .
yes it does , but not for the pen .
i am using grub in fedora 12. but i found the problem , i think grub ca n't handle ntfs partitions . i just format the partition with fat32 and then copy the grub files as earlier and now grub installation worked great . so , is there any way to install grub on ntfs partition ?
yes , it works if i call it with an absolute or relative path
almost every one of them has a different way of accomplishing this , and none of them make it at all simple . some use a seperate namespace for the application , some use a tunnel interface , some do it straight through openvpn in a terminal , yet none of them i 've found has given me any kind of a decipherable method of doing any of these .
yes it does but not sure if it support advanced settings , btw it 's a zxv10 w300
but for listening . my query should n't go on routers 53 but some random port , is n't it ? if it is ok then why it is refused ?
**edit**i just found i have a tftp server on it : # tftp busybox v0.60.5 ( 2012.07.09-14:05+0000 ) multi-call binary usage : tftp [ option ] ... host [ port ] but i ca n't find any good information on how to use tftp . and looking around google i 'm seeing it 's good for loading binary images , so i 'm assume anything could be sent , but i 'm not sure .
west yes , they do .
thanks for the quick comment : p yea the io pins are being controled via a python script . by small web server you mean http server ? anything i could google for that ? i 'm really not an expert on the network side of things xd
yip , the company requested that we use our personal phones for work mail access . samsung galaxy ii . i have since deleted the mail box off my phone and other personal devices .
if that 's the case . what is the software should be installed ?
- no it surely doesnt because it goes into the remote machines 'clipboard equivalent ' . and that content seems inaccessible on the local ( windows ) machine .
: i 'm so sorry ! what do u mean ? ? i do n't know !
that is a good idea . i would be very grateful for any tips on how to lock down such a temporary account .
if you are saying it wo n't let me download because i do n't have the software to use the file , that is incorrect , as i have photoshop , which opens .psd ( photoshop documents ) . if you are saying that it is because google drive does not have the right reader to open the file , this is also incorrect as google can natively open .psd documents . thanks for the reply though~
correct . ( 10 chars )
i fount that the answer is that i do n't press enter , so the line is still one line but in the screen they are more lines .
no , i have n't seen any fan settings for the cpu in the bios .
i did n't think to try that . however uninstalling , rebooting and installing again fixed the issue . still no explanation why it happened though .
: yes , -r
-- edit i should point out it 's win 7 pro x64
real-estate ...
i want to block some types of websites .
i just shut down , no hibernation or sleep
i think you did n't understand the question , or i did n't explain myself correctly . the key here is that there is a shared file that can be modified by anyone in a peer to peer network , just the same that happens with the bitcoin blockchain . i heard that bitcoin had problems when a malicious user created a transaction with bytes of data that were recognized as virus by many antiviruses causing bitcoin to stop at that point of the blockchain . i would like to know whats the fastest algorithm that i could use to prevent that , and the best one i can think of is aes .
seems to use *subnet mask* .
i can not connect to 10.8.0.1 either .
: i am using kernel 3.2.0-36. grcies : - )
the errors usually do n't last long enough to get any details from them unfortunately .
actually i needed to do a bufferoverflow demonstration in class ... and i volunteered ... now i cant back off ... i thought i would find the distro on the net ... but its been 2 weeks ... no luck yet
forgot to mention : all the volume functions work , it 's just the icon that 's missing . i can control the volume by the keyboard or through the actual volume control ( by pulling up the control panel widget ) . i just do n't have the icon on the systemtray . all the rest of the system works tho .
see the fourth option of the `movie profile` : [ image link ] ( am not sure if it is bd or not ! but my pc was working perfectly until i installed bd 2015 ! , and even after uninstalling it seems to have no effect , maybe it modified some system files or so . disabling the feature has no effect !
thanks for the tip regarding ati services . i appear to have only one , ati hotkey poller ( which i do not seem to require ) . i have disabled this , but i still get the run as dialog at login and the events are still logged under aceeventlog .
yep its windows 8 core single language edition . is there anyway to download this
: can you point me to something from microsoft that confirms this ?
the f4 key is too far . either ctrl-w or alt-space-c is much much faster with some practice . alt-space-c works with every program that i use though..
, 192.168.0.1 is not the gateway used on router b , but rather its own ip on the lan interface . sorry about that .
i 'm using ext4 for the linux partition . care to explain why it 's safe in ext # case ?
some printer drivers allow custom sizes but those sizes are restricted , i will try and check some models and post results .
: chrome is not opened in multiple instances , only one tab is opened .
i 've disabled the manual proxy a few moments ago so it 's not on at the moment . i tried to manually turn it on but it does n't seem to do anything that way . netstat -a does n't show up any 8118 ports , maybe because i was the one to turn on the proxy . if you have any suggestions on how to get it work to see what is listening on that port that would be amazing , otherwise i 'll have to wait for it to automatically turn on again .
: that 's what i told him . apparently , he does n't have very skilled employees - as in skilled with computer - to steal data other than copying it on a pen drive or something . so , it 's a hardware access problem . and he thinks a single storage could cut down his costs , which i think is not probable . but i need some confirmation , so thought to ask it here .
just font @ anyamairead
i took my droid out and played hot and cold until i found them , no problem .
nothing happens when i put it in regular crontab , that was what i tried first . a solution suggested to do sudo , even though there 's nothing fancy in my bitbucket script
is that the speed at what a vga cable transfers ? i do n't understand all the details of data transfer . i was just looking for a way to not connect the cable and not be limited to the short distance of the usb wireless devices like the warpia streamhd .
yes , it is installed
yes , i 've never seen the grub screen before a failure .
[ edit ] there 's something strange going on , winsxs does have the latest version of this driver , but system32 has the older one . i 'm hoping that re-installing the kb will fix this . do n't want to take the risk , as simply copying the files over manually might confuse windows .
i 'm not looking for encryption . locked archives enables me to classify files in organized packages . for example all of the files needed to run a portable app can be backed up into such an archive , if a file is deleted the app may not run after extracting
i have a video converter , so any format will work .
how do i find that out ? can it be exim4 ? ( sendmail or postfix are not installed here )
`crysis.exe` ( old crysis game executable )
- that would be far easier . the problem is , we stupidly lost the source code to the application and unfortunately the username and password is hard coded in the app .
- sure , thanks !
yes and no , i did myself a setup with a vpn and some nating , which kinda works , but i left the question unanswered , waiting for some maybe better solution , or just other solutions . once my setup will be stable , will post and answer here myself anyway
edit : updated to better explain -- the fields included are just those fields that are available to me to complete this sort . the output that i 'm looking for is , in any form , a list of all unique user ids that acquired `tagx` at any point , but did not have `tagy` before they acquired `tagx` .
yeah it has one - updated my op to show you the details .
numerical data on the left and the counts of those numbers on the right .
, 10 windows , with 10 tabs each , sounds like an average number of things i often have open . no reason inactive windows have to consume any cpu time at all , and memory is cheap .
yes , `eth0` is connected to nat on the guest .
just got off the phone w/ tech support . it is the card . add that as a answer and you 'll get the check .
pc almost 6 years old.changed the motherboard two years ago .currently running windows 7
it is an infinity foot pedal . start-stop transcription software or the record player software .
actually , as a matter of fact , i do n't even know python . i did n't even look for api docs .
how can i stop this happening ?
- yes , it is set to manual and it says 'started ' .
crond is running according to `ps -e | grep cron` . i even restarted it using `service crond restart` . but no good . addtionally , i added that `test.me` line to 'crontab -e ' and i can see the `test.me` file in the tmp folder ! so cron is running fine
: iomega rx200
it 's literally exactly the same , except the `` , 16 '' on line 25 is removed .
adding it for a new command is sufficient .
